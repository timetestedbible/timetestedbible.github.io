## Introduction
The appointment of Herod as king by the Roman Senate is a pivotal event in Herodian chronology, marking the start of his regal (de jure) reign. This chapter focuses exclusively on the direct evidence from Flavius Josephus' accounts in *Antiquities of the Jews* and *The Jewish War*, without relying on external dates or secondary sources. We examine the narrative details of Herod's journey to Rome, the appointment itself, and the key assumptions underlying common interpretations.

A central point of contention is Josephus' reference to the consular year of Caius Domitius Calvinus (second time) and Caius Asinius Pollio (first time), traditionally linked to the appointment. However, a close reading shows this reference pertains to the year when the sequence of events began—the Parthian invasion and Herod's initial flight—not the completion of the appointment. This distinction counters common statements that pin the appointment directly to that consular year, often overlooking the documented delays in Herod's journey. By highlighting these delays, we reveal how assumptions about travel speed lead to misattributions.

## Section 1: Direct Evidence from Josephus – The Journey to Rome
Josephus provides a detailed, step-by-step account of Herod's escape from Judea and journey to Rome, emphasizing obstacles that extended the timeline. These details are the primary direct evidence, drawn from *Antiquities* Book 14 and parallel passages in *War* Book 1.

### The Parthian Invasion and Initial Flight
The journey begins with the Parthian invasion of Judea, which forced Herod to flee:
> "Now after Herod was come into Egypt, he was in distress what to do; because he heard that his brother Joseph was dead... But as he was in great distress, Cleopatra would not let him go; but encouraged him to undertake another voyage... So he set sail from thence to Pamphylia." (*Antiquities* 14.14.2)

Herod's overland escape route included stops at Masada (to secure his family), Idumea, and through Arabia (where King Malchus initially refused aid), before reaching Alexandria in Egypt. This phase alone involved significant time—logistical arrangements, negotiations, and travel across hostile terrain—spanning weeks.

### The Shipwreck and Storm
En route from Alexandria, Herod encountered a severe storm:
> "[Herod] sailed away in a storm, which fell upon him as he sailed, with great danger; and he was sorely shaken with the tempest, and was thereby in distress... So he set sail from thence to Pamphylia: and falling into a violent storm, he had much ado to escape to Rhodes; with the loss of the ship's burden." (*Antiquities* 14.14.3)

This "violent storm" caused the loss of cargo and nearly the ship itself, forcing Herod to Rhodes in a damaged state. The narrative underscores the peril and disruption, implying substantial time lost at sea and upon arrival.

### Refitting in Rhodes
In Rhodes, Herod faced further delays due to the city's war-damaged state (from Cassius' campaigns) and the need to rebuild his vessel:
> "And there it happened that two of his friends, Sappinas and Ptolemeus, met with him. And as he found that city very much damaged in the war against Cassius, though he were in necessity himself, he neglected not to do it a kindness: but did what he could to recover it to its former state. He also built there a three-decked ship; and set sail thence, with his friends, for Italy: and came to the port of Brundusium." (*Antiquities* 14.14.3)

Herod not only refitted his own ship but aided Rhodes' recovery, sourcing timber, hiring crew, and awaiting supplies. This refitting process—building a "three-decked ship"—would require months, involving skilled labor, materials procurement, and construction in a post-war environment.

No explicit mention of winter occurs, but the sequence (storm during sailing season, refitting in late year) aligns with ancient Mediterranean travel norms, where voyages halted during mare clausum (closed sea, November–March) due to seasonal storms.

### Arrival in Rome and the Appointment
Upon reaching Italy (Brundusium), Herod proceeded to Rome:
> "And when he was come to Rome, all his friends met him... So a senate was convocated: and Messala first, and then Atratinus introduced Herod into it... This seemed good to all the senators: and so they made a decree accordingly." (*Antiquities* 14.14.4)

The appointment was swift—Herod obtained the kingship unexpectedly within seven days in Italy. Antony and Octavian supported him due to prior alliances and strategic needs against the Parthians.

## Section 2: The Consular Reference – Evidence for the Start of the Journey, Not the Appointment
Josephus provides a single direct reference to the consular year in the context of Herod's appointment:
> "And thus did this man receive the Kingdom; having obtained it on the hundred eighty fourth olympiad; when Caius Domitius Calvinus was consul the second time; and Caius Asinius Pollio [the first time.]" (*Antiquities* 14.14.5)

This statement follows the appointment description but does not explicitly date the Senate's decree itself. Instead, a plain reading within the narrative flow ties it to the broader sequence of events initiated by the Parthian invasion and Herod's flight—the "obtaining" process began in that consular/Olympiad year.

### Why the Reference Pertains to the Journey's Start
- **Narrative Placement**: The consular/Olympiad mention comes at the end of the journey account, summarizing the entire process from invasion to appointment. Josephus often uses such markers for the onset of major sequences (e.g., invasions or campaigns), not isolated endpoints.
- **The "Obtaining" Language**: The phrase "having obtained it" encompasses the full effort—escape, delays, travel, and decree—starting with the crisis in Judea during that year.
- **No Precise Appointment Timestamp**: Josephus does not say "the Senate decreed on [date]" but frames the obtaining within the consular year, implying the year's association with the initiating events (Parthian threat, flight).
- **Parallel Usage in Josephus**: In other contexts (e.g., Pompey's conquest), Josephus uses consular years for campaign starts, allowing flexibility for completions.

### Countering Common Misstatements
Many interpretations state the appointment occurred in the consular year of Calvinus and Pollio, treating it as the decree's date. This overlooks:
- The journey's documented duration—weeks of overland travel, storm recovery, months of refitting—making same-year completion improbable without assuming minimal delays.
- Josephus' intent: The reference anchors the story's beginning (invasion/flight), consistent with his historiographical style of marking event origins.

This misstatement arises from assuming instantaneous travel, ignoring Josephus' emphasis on obstacles as narrative evidence of extended time.

## Section 3: Key Assumptions in Interpreting the Evidence
Interpretations hinge on assumptions about the journey's pace and the consular reference's scope.

### Assumption 1: Rapid Journey Without Significant Delays
Common views assume Herod's trip—from Judea to Rome—was swift (weeks/months), fitting within one consular year. However, direct evidence contradicts this:
- Overland phase: 4–6 weeks minimum.
- Sea voyage: Storm-induced losses required full refit.
- Refitting: Building a new ship in war-torn Rhodes implies 3+ months.
This assumption minimizes Josephus' details to force a compressed timeline.

### Assumption 2: Consular Year Strictly Dates the Appointment
This treats the reference as pinpointing the Senate decree, ignoring narrative context. Direct evidence shows it frames the "obtaining" process from start (invasion/flight) to end.

### The Evidence-Based Alternative
Without these assumptions, the journey's delays (storm, refitting) extend the timeline, placing the appointment after the consular year's events began. This aligns with Josephus' emphasis on hardships as integral to the story.

## Conclusion
Josephus' direct evidence—detailed journey obstacles—establishes a prolonged process from Parthian crisis to Roman decree. The consular reference anchors the start of this sequence, not the appointment, countering common misattributions that assume rapid travel. By discarding key assumptions of haste and precise dating, we gain a chronology faithful to the text: a multi-month ordeal culminating post-delays. This framework resolves apparent tensions, prioritizing Josephus' narrative over imposed timelines.
