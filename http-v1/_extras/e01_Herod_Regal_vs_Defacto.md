## Introduction: Why Focus Solely on Josephus' Own Words?

Josephus provides the primary (and often sole) ancient narrative for Herod the Great's life and chronology in his two major works: *Antiquities of the Jews* and *The Jewish War*. These texts contain a deliberate **dual reckoning** for Herod's reign: one longer count tied to his formal appointment as king, and a shorter count tied to his actual possession of power in Jerusalem. The key interpretive question is: When Josephus refers to events "in the reign of Herod" or "in the [ordinal number] year of the reign of Herod" without further qualification, which count does he intend?

This chapter builds the strongest possible case **using only Josephus' internal evidence**—his wording, grammatical patterns, explicit statements, repeated qualifiers, and narrative consistency across books. No external dates (Roman consuls, Olympiads, eclipses, Actium, sons' reigns, coins, or modern calendars) are assumed or imported. The argument rests entirely on how Josephus himself structures his account, particularly his explicit benchmark at Herod's death and his consistent use (or non-use) of qualifiers throughout the narrative.

## Section 1: The Explicit Benchmark at Herod's Death – The Foundational Text

The clearest internal guide appears at the moment of Herod's death, where Josephus deliberately provides **two parallel counts** without ambiguity:

- In *Antiquities* 17.8.1 (Whiston translation): "...having reigned, since he had procured Antigonus to be slain, thirty-four years; but since he had been declared king by the Romans, thirty-seven."
- In *War* 1.33.8 (parallel passage): "...having reigned thirty-four years, since he had caused Antigonus to be slain, and obtained his kingdom; but thirty-seven years since he had been made king by the Romans."

This is Josephus' own summary statement, placed at the natural endpoint of the reign narrative. Key observations from the text alone:

- The **longer count (37 years)** is linked to being "declared/made king by the Romans" – a formal, titular act.
- The **shorter count (34 years)** is linked to "procured Antigonus to be slain" or "caused Antigonus to be slain" – an event tied to actual conquest and removal of the prior ruler.
- Josephus presents the **37-year count first** in the sentence structure (in both passages), then contrasts it with the 34-year count using "but" (Greek *de* or equivalent connective), signaling the primary/default as the longer one.
- No further explanation is needed for the reader to understand the distinction; Josephus assumes the audience grasps that "declared king by the Romans" refers to an earlier, official grant, while the Antigonus event marks practical control.

This benchmark establishes a clear rule: **When Josephus wants the reader to use the shorter (Antigonus/conquest-based) count, he qualifies it explicitly.** The unqualified or primary "reign" phrasing defaults to the longer (Roman-declared) count.

## Section 2: Patterns of Qualification Throughout the Narrative

Josephus maintains this pattern consistently when referring to Herod's reign length or ordinal years:

- **Unqualified "reign" phrases** (e.g., "in the reign of Herod," "of the reign of Herod") appear in broad, summary, or introductory contexts and align with the longer count unless overridden.
- **De facto qualifiers** are repeatedly added when Josephus intends the shorter count or when describing events after conquest:
  - "since he had procured Antigonus to be slain" (*Ant.* 17.8.1)
  - "from the death of Antigonus" (parallel in *War*)
  - "since he had caused Antigonus to be slain" (*War* 1.33.8)
  - Similar qualifiers appear in other passages discussing post-conquest events (e.g., references to "from the time he took Jerusalem" or equivalent in siege/conquest sections).

- In the narrative flow:
  - Before the conquest: Herod is repeatedly called "king" or described as receiving/holding "the kingdom" from Roman grant, even while fighting for control. The language emphasizes title and legitimacy.
  - After conquest: When Josephus counts years for building projects, family events, or wars, he often adds qualifiers if precision matters, but broad "reign" statements revert to the primary (longer) framework.

This asymmetry is telling: Josephus never defaults to the shorter count without a qualifier like "from the death of Antigonus" or "since he took Jerusalem." The absence of such a phrase signals the regal/default count.

## Section 3: Ordinal Year References and Contextual Clues

Ordinal years (e.g., "in the seventh year of the reign of Herod") provide further internal consistency:

- When Josephus uses an ordinal without qualification (e.g., "in the seventh year of the reign of Herod" in *Ant.* 15.5.2), the plain reading follows the same rule as the death summary: regal unless context forces otherwise.
- Events tied to pre-conquest or Roman-context (e.g., preparation for Roman wars) fit more naturally with the longer count, as the narrative treats Herod as "king" from appointment onward.
- Post-conquest events (e.g., temple building in the 18th year, family intrigues) sometimes carry implicit de facto flavor due to context, but Josephus adds qualifiers when he wants to emphasize the shorter span.

The pattern holds: **Qualification = de facto intent; no qualification = regal/default.**

## Section 4: Narrative Consistency and Authorial Intent

Josephus writes as a historian emphasizing legitimacy (Herod's Roman backing) while acknowledging practical realities (the siege and Antigonus' fall). By leading with the 37-year count at death and using qualifiers only for the 34-year span, he signals priority:

- The regal count reflects Herod's self-understanding and Roman perspective (client-king status from Senate grant).
- The de facto count is a Jewish/historical corrective for actual rule in Judea.

This dual presentation is intentional: Josephus preserves both for completeness but defaults to regal in unmarked cases.

## Section 5: Addressing Potential Objections Internally

- **Objection: All ordinals must be de facto because post-conquest events dominate the narrative.**  
  Response: The death summary explicitly contrasts both; if ordinals were always de facto, the 37-year count would never appear unqualified. Yet it does in the benchmark.

- **Objection: Inclusive counting blurs the lines.**  
  Response: Josephus' own wording distinguishes the anchors ("declared by Romans" vs. "procured Antigonus slain") regardless of inclusive/exclusive math. The distinction is event-based, not arithmetic.

- **Objection: Context sometimes implies de facto.**  
  Response: Yes—for local Judean events—but unqualified broad phrases (especially summaries) revert to regal, per the death-text pattern.

## Conclusion: A Robust, Text-Immanent Rule

From Josephus' own words—especially the explicit dual statement at Herod's death—the strongest internal case is:

**Josephus defaults to the regal reckoning (from Roman declaration) in unqualified references to "the reign of Herod" or its ordinal years. He shifts to de facto only with explicit qualifiers like "since Antigonus was slain," "from the death of Antigonus," or equivalent conquest markers.**

This rule emerges directly from the text's structure, grammar, and patterns without any external assumptions. It provides a consistent lens for reading the Herodian narrative, minimizing interpretive leaps and honoring Josephus' careful historiographical distinctions.
