The emphasis on total darkness\u2014'horror of great darkness' and 'it was dark'\u2014suggests a dark moon, which aligns with the 15th being naturally dark if the month starts at full moon.",

Because Tyre gloated over Jerusalem's fall ('The gate to the nations is broken... I will be filled'), God declares judgment: **many nations will rise like waves**, Tyre will become **a bare rock for spreading nets**, and will **never be rebuilt**. While historically Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander partially fulfilled this, the 'never rebuilt' clause (v. 14, 21) suggests a dual/typological layer pointing to **Babylon the Great** (Revelation 17-18). Revelation 18 directly echoes Ezekiel 26-27: merchants/kings weeping, sudden ruin, 'found no more forever.' Ezekiel 28's description of Tyre's king as a fallen cherub in Eden links to satanic influence behind the final Antichrist system.",
