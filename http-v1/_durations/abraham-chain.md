# Abraham Chronology Chain

Abraham's chronology anchors the patriarchal period. The **Covenant with Abraham** (1876 BC) serves as a fixed anchor, from which other events are calculated.

## The 430 Years

> "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, **even the selfsame day** it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt."
— Exodus 12:40-41

> "And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was **four hundred and thirty years after**, cannot disannul."
— Galatians 3:17

Paul clarifies: the 430 years is from the **Covenant**, not from Jacob entering Egypt.
