## Typological Parallels

The 40-day period parallels several biblical events:
- Moses on Mount Sinai: 40 days (Exodus 24:18)
- Elijah's journey to Horeb: 40 days (1 Kings 19:8)
- Israel's wilderness wandering: 40 years

## Notes

- The wilderness period begins "immediately" after baptism (Mark 1:12)
- All three synoptic gospels confirm the 40-day duration
- This is a "40 days and 40 nights" (Matthew), indicating complete days
