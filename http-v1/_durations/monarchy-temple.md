# Monarchy and Temple Chronology

## Overview

The Temple chronology provides key anchors for dating the Israelite monarchy. Solomon's 4th year (Temple foundation) is fixed at 966 BC via the 480-year count from Exodus.

david-reign-start (1010 BC)

david-death
    ↓ +0 (same time)
solomon-reign-start (970 BC)

## Duration Details

| From | To | Offset | Source |
|------|-----|--------|--------|
| david-death | david-reign | -40 years | 2 Sam 5:4 "David was 30 years old... reigned 40 years" |
| david-death | solomon-reign | +0 | 1 Ki 2:12 "Solomon sat upon the throne of David" |
| solomon-reign | temple-construction | +4 years | 1 Ki 6:1 "in the fourth year of Solomon's reign" |

## Key Dates

| Event | Year BC | Calculation |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Temple foundation | 966 BC | Exodus (1446) - 480 years |
| Solomon year 1 | 970 BC | Temple (966) + 4 years |
| David death | 970 BC | = Solomon year 1 |
| David reign start | 1010 BC | Death - 40 years |
| David birth | 1040 BC | Reign start - 30 years |

## Sources

> "David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years."
— 2 Samuel 5:4

> "And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
— 1 Kings 2:11

## Cross-Validation

| Calculation Path | Solomon Year 1 |
|------------------|----------------|
| Exodus (1446) - 480 + 4 | 970 BC |
| David death (after 40y reign) | 970 BC |

Both paths converge on 970 BC for Solomon's accession.
