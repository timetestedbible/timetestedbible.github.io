# Herod the Great Chronology

## Overview

Herod's chronology is anchored by multiple astronomical and historical references. The **lunar eclipse of January 10, 1 BC** before Herod's death is a key anchor.

## Chain Structure

herod-takes-jerusalem (7/10, 36 BC - Day of Atonement)
    ↓ -3 regal years
herod-senate-appointment (~39 BC - derived, not direct)
    ↓ +37 regal years
herod-death (1 BC)

herod-eclipse (1/10/1 BC - astronomical ANCHOR)
    ↓ [days before death]
herod-death (12/29, 1 BC)
    ↓ -70 years
herod-birth (~70 BC)
    ↓ +15 years
herod-governor-galilee (~55 BC)

herod-takes-jerusalem (7/10, 36 BC)
    ↓ +0
herod-defacto-reign
    ↓ +17 years

| herod-death | herod-birth | -70 years | Josephus Ant. 17.6.1 "about seventy" |
| herod-birth | herod-governor-galilee | +15 years | Josephus Ant. 14.9.2 "fifteen years old" |
| herod-takes-jerusalem | herod-defacto-reign | +0 | Same event starts reign |
| herod-defacto-reign | herod-temple-decree | +17 years | Josephus Ant. 15.11.1 "eighteenth year" |
| herod-temple-decree | herod-temple-construction | +1 year | Josephus Ant. 15.11.2 (preparation period) |

## Note on Senate Appointment Dating

The exact date of Herod's Roman Senate appointment cannot be independently determined. Stories about his journey to Rome and shipwreck are ambiguous and don't provide precise timing. The **only** solid dating method is:

1. Herod took Jerusalem on Day of Atonement, 36 BC (from Pompey +27 years)
2. Josephus says this was in Herod's **3rd regal year**
3. Therefore appointment was ~3 years before = ~39 BC

## Key Anchors

### 1. Lunar Eclipse (Jan 10, 1 BC)
> "And that very night there was an eclipse of the moon."
— Josephus, Antiquities 17.6.4

NASA confirms a total lunar eclipse on January 10, 1 BC—far more dramatic than the partial eclipse of March 4 BC often cited.

### 2. Day of Atonement Capture (36 BC)
> "This destruction befell the city of Jerusalem... on the solemnity of the fast, as if a periodical revolution of calamities had returned since that which befell the Jews under Pompey; for the Jews were taken by him on the same day, and this was after twenty-seven years' time."
— Josephus, Antiquities 14.16.4

Herod captured Jerusalem on the Day of Atonement (7/10), exactly 27 years after Pompey's capture on the same day.

## Cross-Validation

| Calculation | Birth Year |
|-------------|------------|
| Death (1 BC) - 70 years | ~70 BC |
| Governor (55 BC) - 15 years | ~70 BC |

Both paths converge on approximately 70 BC.

## Reign Lengths (Josephus)

- **37 years** from Roman appointment (~39 BC, derived from Jerusalem capture -3 years)
- **34 years** from capturing Jerusalem (36 BC de facto)

Both reckonings point to death in early 1 BC (before Nisan 1).
