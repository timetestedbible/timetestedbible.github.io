## Key Anchors

### VAT 4956 Astronomical Tablet
Babylonian astronomical diary from Nebuchadnezzar's 37th year with lunar and planetary observations confirmed by modern astronomy to 568/567 BC.

### Artaxerxes Accession
Persian records establish Artaxerxes I's accession in 465 BC, with his 7th year (Ezra's decree) in 458/457 BC.

## Daniel's Prophecies

### 70 Weeks (Daniel 9:24-27)
> "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people..."

- 70 weeks = 490 years (lunar)
- From Ezra's decree (458 BC) to Messiah

### 1335 Days/Years (Daniel 12:12)
> "Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days."

- From captivity (597 BC) + 1335 = 738 AD
- Possible reference to rise of Islamic empire turning point
