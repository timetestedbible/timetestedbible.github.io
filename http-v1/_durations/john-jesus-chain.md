## Key Anchor: Tiberius 15th Year

> "Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar... the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness."
— Luke 3:1-2

- Tiberius reign began: September 17, 14 AD (Senate investiture)
- 15th year began: September 17, 28 AD
- John began ministry: earliest possible at age 30 per priestly requirements

## Calculation

| Event | Date | Calculation |
|-------|------|-------------|
| John's ministry | Sept 17, 28 AD | Tiberius 15th year |
| John's birth (earliest) | ~Sept, 3 BC | Ministry - 30 years |
| Jesus's birth (earliest) | ~March, 2 BC | John's birth + 6 months |
| Jesus's baptism | Nisan 1, 29 AD | Ministry + ~6 months |

## The 6-Month Gap

> "And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her..."
— Luke 1:36

Jesus was conceived when Elisabeth was 6 months pregnant, making Jesus approximately 6 months younger than John.

## Cross-Validation

| Event | Calculation |
|-------|-------------|
| John begins ministry | Tiberius 15 (28 AD), age 30+ |
| Jesus baptized | Nisan 1, 29 AD, age 30 |
| Jesus ministry | 3+ years |
| Crucifixion | Passover 32 AD (3rd Passover) |
| 46 years Temple building | Herod's 18th year (18 BC) + 46 = 30 AD (John 2:20) ✓ |
