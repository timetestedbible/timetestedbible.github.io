section: scriptural
statement: "Counting 7 weeks from the 16th cannot land on 'day after 7th Sabbath' with a continuous weekly cycle"
confidence: High
rejected: false
evidence:
  - "Leviticus 23:15-16 requires counting from First Fruits to 'the day after the seventh Sabbath' (50 days)"
  - "First Fruits is on the 16th (established by LXX, Josephus, Philo, Joshua 5)"
  - "First Fruits is 'the morrow after the Sabbath' - first day of the week"
  - "Therefore Pentecost should always be on a fixed date relative to the month"
  - "BUT with a continuous 7-day week, the 16th falls on different weekdays each year"
  - "In 6 of 7 years, the 16th is NOT the day after a Sabbath under continuous week"
  - "This paradox ONLY resolves if weeks reset with each new month"
  - "This is INDEPENDENT evidence - does not assume lunar Sabbath to prove it"

This paradox is a mathematical proof that does NOT assume the lunar Sabbath. It shows that the scriptural requirements for First Fruits (always 16th, always first day of week) are incompatible with a continuous 7-day cycle - independent evidence for monthly week reset.
