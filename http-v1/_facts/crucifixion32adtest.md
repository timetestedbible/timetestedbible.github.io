This validation test is why scholars avoid 32 AD despite overwhelming historical evidence pointing to it. Under Saturday Sabbath with any traditional month start, the 32 AD Passover falls on Monday or Tuesday - incompatible with the Gospel accounts. Only the lunar Sabbath system produces "preparation day" on every Passover.
