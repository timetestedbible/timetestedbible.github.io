level: 4
section: calendar
statement: "The visible sliver moon calendar is rejected because the 15th of 2nd month in 1446 BC falls on Friday, not a Sabbath"
confidence: High
rejected: true
evidence:
  - "Scripture establishes the 15th of 2nd month was a Sabbath (Exodus 16)"
  - "Using astronomical software for 1446 BC with sliver moon calendar..."
  - "The first visible crescent was easily seen (moon age 1.5 days, 2.4% illuminated)"
  - "Under this calendar, the 15th of 2nd month = Friday"
  - "Friday is NOT the Sabbath under any interpretation"
  - "Therefore, the sliver moon calendar contradicts Scripture"
rejection_reason:
  - "The 15th of 2nd month falls on Friday, contradicting Exodus 16's Sabbath identification"
  - "This is not a marginal case - the crescent was easily visible"
  - "No reasonable adjustment can reconcile sliver moon with this scriptural test"

The visible sliver moon calendar - the most widely taught "biblical" calendar - fails the simplest scriptural test. The Exodus 16 narrative clearly identifies the 15th as a Sabbath, but under the sliver moon calendar it falls on Friday.
