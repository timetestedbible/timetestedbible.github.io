Miscellaneous Commands

This chapter is to point you to some basic commands that many people may not be aware of. The love of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is to keep his commands and he who keeps and teaches the least shall be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven. 

WWJD? Wear Tassels

> Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel: Tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue thread in the tassels of the corners. And you shall have the tassel, that you may look upon it and remember all the commandments of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 and do them, and that you may not follow the harlotry to which your own heart and your own eyes are inclined, and that you may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy for your God. I am 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am  𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God.”

> — Numbers 15:37-41

> You shall make tassels on the four corners of the clothing with which you cover yourself.

> — Deuteronomy 22:12

Greatest Command
“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”
> Yeshua declared, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

> — Matthew 22:36-40

Diet Laws
The church has wrongly taught that the dietary laws have been done away with since Yeshua. When reading the New Testament scriptures it is important to keep in mind that the definition of the word “food” is found in Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 14. Food did not have the modern meaning of “anything we put in our mouth”.  When we eat “biblical food” it goes into our mouth and is purified by our stomach and then expelled, thereby cleaning all “biblical food”. 
On the day of judgment those who willfully eat swine and other “unclean food” without repentance will be thrown into the fire. 

For by fire and His sword (nukes), 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 will execute judgment on all flesh, and many will be slain by 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 …those who eat the flesh of swine and vermin and rats—will perish together,” declares 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.
— Isaiah 66:16-17

Biblical Food:
Land animals: Animals with split hoofs that chew their food are permitted, but camels, pigs, rock badgers, and hares are not. 
Water animals: Fish with fins and scales are permitted, but shellfish and fish without fins and scales are not. 
Fowl: Certain fowl are forbidden, including birds of prey, birds that eat carrion, and certain water birds. Poultry, pigeon, and doves are permitted, as are wild birds not on the forbidden list. 
Blood: Blood from mammals and birds is forbidden. 
Fat: Forbidden fat is the covering fat of mammals, not the fat marbled into the meat. 10 Commandments

And God spoke all these words, saying:
“I am 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
“You shall have no other gods before Me.
“You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing mercy to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
“You shall not take the name of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain.
“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God. In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.
“Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 your God is giving you.
“You shall not murder.
“You shall not commit adultery.
“You shall not steal.
“You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.
“You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s.”
— Exodus 20


Forgive Others

> For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. “But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.”

> — Matthew 6:14


Judge Not

> Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.

> — Matthew 7

This particular verse and concept has been distorted by those who seek to nullify the law. The idea is that only 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 can judge the heart of a man and pronounce them guilty or not. It is not judging others to remind them of what the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 says or to declare certain behaviors to be breaking 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄’s law. The line is crossed when you condemn others to hell or proscribe salvation unto yourself by virtue of your keeping of the law in more points than them. 
Keeping the law can be a source of pride that tempt many people to think too highly of themselves. That pride is a deadly sin and the penalty of breaking the greatest or the least of the laws is the same: death. Since all have sinned and continue to sin while in the flesh it is foolish to condemn others simply because they disagree with you. I do not wish to be judged by my ability to discern all doctrine correctly and follow it; therefore, I do not condemn others simply because they disagree with my conclusions.
