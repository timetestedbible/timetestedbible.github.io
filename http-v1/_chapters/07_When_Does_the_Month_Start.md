When I first started seeking the truth in the calendar I came across this crazy idea that the month starts with the full moon. I almost dismissed it as too ridiculous to even consider, but something inside me prompted me that I needed to “_test everything and hold on to that which is good_”. If I had dismissed something simply because it was so far from every _tradition_ I had ever heard I might never have discovered the most compelling case from scripture to define the start of the month.

Having an accurate map is critical if you want to find your destination. A calendar can be viewed as a map of time and lets us know when to expect 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 to act in major ways. If you desire to keep his commandments, such as the Sabbath and the Feasts, then you need to know when the month starts.

I’m friends with several prominent YouTuber teachers from well known ministries who hold to traditional calendars and I challenged them to prove their calendar using only Stellarium, a night sky simulator, and the canonical scriptures (the Bible). Both of them told me I was rigging the challenge by not allowing them to introduce evidence of tradition of men and non-canonical texts. These teachers who lean heavily on a particular calendar in their teachings conceded right out of the gate that they had no meaningful evidence from the cannon. This should be a major warning that we need see what cannon does say before adopting the traditions of men.

  

  

The First Statute given Moses

The very first command or statute given to Moses was:

  

_And_ 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 _spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,_ **_This month_** **shall be** **_unto you the beginning of months_**_: it_ shall be > *the first month of the year to you…*

> — Exodus 12

  

_Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto_ 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 > *thy God…And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks… and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.*

> — Deuteronomy 16

  

The first statute mentioned in Deuteronomy 16 is observing the month of Abib which means we must know when that month begins and ends if we are to walk in it as a sign that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is our God.

  

> *“But I said to their children in the wilderness, ‘Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers’.*
> — Ezekiel 20

  

So the question one must ask is what were the statutes of their fathers that they are not to walk in?

  

> *Ancient Egyptians started their lunar months when the waning moon disappeared just before dawn.*
> — Google AI & Wikipedia

  

Here is what we know. Every ancient culture from Babylon to Egypt to China had a calendar that started the month on the dark or sliver moon. This is a tradition of the entire world! The question is, did the whole world happen to follow 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄’s calendar, or did the Jewish people get coerced or otherwise corrupted to follow the world’s calendar? How could we even determine which is true? Were “some of the statutes” of our fathers, such as their Egyptian calendar months “Ok” and others “not ok”? If so how could we tell?

Right off the bat, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 addresses the calendar and gives them an instruction about the start of the year and it is in this context they were told not to walk in the statues of their fathers, which could include the calendar, of Egypt.

So what would happen if we only looked at scripture and we looked at it with fresh eyes, not eyes tainted by a Jewish Rabbi telling us what it means.

Before going further we must address word/phrase “new moon” which has a modern scientific definition as the day the moon is invisible because it is in conjunction between the earth and sun. A better understanding of the phrase is “_the phase of the moon that marks the beginning of a month_” because there are many different traditions that use different phases. The scientific association with the dark moon is an artifact of how the majority of ancient nations started their months at or near the dark moon. It would be circular reasoning to say the month starts on the dark moon because the dark moon is called a new moon.

This argument presents a **cohesive case for a full-moon** calendar system using a **Sola Scriptura** framework, built upon a **literal interpretation** of several biblical texts and the physical astronomy described therein. This argument posits that the Holy Scripture provides an explicit, self-defining mandate for a calendar system that begins each month with the full moon, effectively nullifying contradictory traditions of men that use the dark conjunction or sighted sliver moon.

  

The Creation Mandate and the Rule of the Lights

Genesis 1:14–16 establishes the purpose and authority of the sun and moon: they are for “signs” (_ʾōtōt_) and “appointed times” (_mōʿădīm_).  

_And God made the_ **_two_**  **_great_**  **_lights_**_— the greater light to govern the day, and the_ **_lesser light to govern_** _the night_ **_with the stars_**> *” (Genesis 1:16, literal syntax)*

> — Genesis 1:14-16

  

This passage establishes a non-negotiable condition for the moon’s authority for signs: it must “govern at night **_with the stars_**.”

  

**Full Moon:** Only the **full moon** is visible from dusk till dawn, ruling the _entire_ night alongside the visible constellations. This is a dual witness and there is one objective day where this occurs.

**Crescent Moon:** The sliver (crescent) moon quickly vanishes with the sunset, isn’t visible with the stars, is incapable of co-ruling the whole night with the stars, and isn’t a great light considering it is barely visible. Its defining property is that **it is the smallest possible light on the moon that can be seen**. Thus, it lacks the divine authority of a “great light” for defining the sacred _mōʿădīm_ (appointed times). It is also a lone witness without sun or stars.

**Dark Moon:** Is not a light, thus it is not for signs and there can be two or three nights where no moon is visible even with ideal viewing conditions and thus the sign is ambiguous without calculation.

  

This mandate is echoed in the Psalms:

  

_“The sun to rule by day… The_ **_moon and stars_** > *to rule by night.”*

> — Psalms 136:8–9

  

The full moon also fits the requirement that all things be established by two or three witnesses. (Deut 19:15, 17:6; Mat 18:16; 2 Cor 14:1; 1 Tim 5:19; Heb 10:28), and we will see later that t**he moon and stars are faithful witnesses** unlike those from the Jewish fables, because God is true and every man a liar.

  

The Direct Definition of the Month’s Start

The scriptural pattern continues with direct instruction in Psalms 81:3, which uses synonymous poetic parallelism to equate the start of the month with the full moon phase:  

_“Blow_ **_in the renewed moon_** _(ḥodesh) the shofar;_ **_in the full moon_** > *(keseh) for the day of our feast (ḥag).” (Psalms 81:3, literal translation)*

> — Psalms 81:3

  

Without an inserted “_and_”, the text equates ḥodesh (renewed moon) with keseh (fullness/full moon). The command is to sound the shofar for the unified event which marks the “_day of our feast_”, the Renewed Moon celebration. This verse defines the full moon as the authoritative “_new moon_” for the biblical calendar. There is no comparable verse that describes a dark or sliver moon in scripture.

Some scholars interpret keseh as the noun form of the Hebrew root הסכ (k-s-h). This root means “_to cover_” and is used in phrases like “_The waters covered the mountains_” or “_the cloud covered the mountain_”. They argue that the moon is “_covered_” or not visible; however, there are multiple ways of understanding “_covered_” because it could just as easily imply “_light covered moon”._ Most scholars believe keseh to be an Aramaic loanword meaning "full moon”. Hebrew, Aramaic, and Akkadian/Assyrian (all Semitic) frequently share vocabulary, especially for astronomical/time terms:

  

-   Aramaic **kista** (or similar forms) meaning "full moon."
-   Assyrian/Akkadian **kuseu** (or related) also denoting "full moon."

  

These are closer cognates than forcing a purely Hebrew "_cover_" derivation. Loanwords were common in Biblical Hebrew (especially post-exilic or via cultural contact), and astronomical terms often borrowed from neighboring languages. The "_cover_" root produces a logical but strained metaphor (dark moon as "_covered_"), while the loanword directly matches a concrete astronomical sense without needing extra explanation.

Since many Hebrew root words are homonyms that may have completely unrelated meanings and the meaning of “covered” could just as easily apply to “_covered with light_” the balance of evidence points toward a full moon interpretation. If this was the only scripture pointing toward a full moon one could argue ambiguity, but this is only one of many legs of the argument.

The word used for feast (ḥaggēnu) does not require it to be a pilgrimage feast such as Passover or Tabernacles but can apply equally to Renewed Moon feasts. Those who attempt to explain this away as two different times of blowing have to insert “_and_” into the text and narrow the meaning of this word to only be a pilgrimage feast vs its broader use of any festive occasion or sacrifice. Furthermore, they have to apply it to only some months and not all. We know that renewed moon day was a festive feast because of the story of David being expected to eat with the king on the renewed moon. A third of the time this word is used in scripture it is referring to something other than a Pilgrimage Feast in the middle of the month.

  

The Hebrew Root: Renewal and Fresh Perfection

At its core, the Hebrew word translated as “new moon”, ḥōḏeš, comes from the verb **ḥāḏaš** (חָדַשׁ), which means “to be new,” “to renew,” or “to make fresh.” This isn’t a vague “starting over” — it’s about **restoring to a complete, perfect state**, like polishing something worn to its original shine. The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew Lexicon (BDB, p. 294) defines ḥāḏaš as “to be new, renew, repair”, implying a **fresh, unblemished completeness** rather than a bare beginning.

  

For example:

-   In Ezekiel 36:26, God promises a “**renewed heart**” — not a blank slate, not a partially renewed, but a fully renewed, perfect one.
-   In Isaiah 43:19, “Behold, I will do a **renewed thing**” — something completely restored and effective, not partial.
-   In Psalms 104:30, “You renew the face of the earth”
-   Isaiah 61:4, “they shall renew the ruined cities”
-   Psalms 51:10, “Renew a steadfast spirit within me”
-   2 Chronicles 24:12, “Renew the house of the LORD”
-   2 Chronicles 15:8, “Renewed the altar of the LORD”
-   1 Samuel 11:14, “Let us renew the kingdom”  
    

In all of these cases the word implies to restore to perfection. Applied to the moon, this suggests ḥōḏeš marks the phase when the moon is fully **renewed, its most perfect form** — a visible, complete circle of light. BDB notes that in Semitic contexts, such roots often carry this sense of “perfection through renewal,” tying back to the idea of wholeness.

  

Quick Explanation of the Noun Form (**חֹדֶשׁ**)

**Root:** Same three letters ח-ד-ש as all the verbs above.

**Form Change:** The noun is a qal passive participle (something that has been renewed) with a vowel shift (o-class for time nouns). This is standard Hebrew grammar for turning a verb into a noun meaning “the renewed thing” (like שֹׁמֵר from שָׁמַר = “guard” → “the one who guards”).

**No Extra Letters:** The core is חדש — same as the verbs. The final ׁ is just the standard noun ending for this pattern.

  

The noun ḥōḏeš is not a different word — it’s the noun version of the verb ḥāḏaš, implying “_the moon that has been renewed to perfection._”  Every verb use proves the meaning is full restoration. The noun carries the exact same meaning to the moon.

  

Diving Deeper into Meaning of Letters

To derive the meaning of a Hebrew word from the combined meanings of its individual letters is a legitimate approach rooted in the ancient origins of the Hebrew alphabet, which began as a pictographic script (Proto-Sinaitic, around 1800 BC) where **each letter was a symbol representing an object or concept.** Over time, these symbols evolved into abstract letters, but early Semitic scholars and biblical linguists (like those in the works of Jeff Benner or the Ancient Hebrew Research Center) recognize that **Hebrew words often carry layered meanings from their letters’ original symbols **— similar to how English words like “understand” combine “under” (position) + “stand” (posture) to convey grasping an idea. This method isn’t mystical or arbitrary; it’s a form of symbolic etymology used in academic Hebrew studies to uncover deeper intent, especially for roots like this one where the letters evoke vivid images. It’s not the only way to define words (context and usage are primary), but it provides thoughtful insight when the plain meaning aligns with the symbolic one, as we’ll see below.

The letter-by-letter breakdown of the word for “renewed moon” (ḥōḏeš in vocalized form; bare consonants: ח ד ש). The following table shows the ancient pictographic symbol for each letter and its general meaning in biblical Hebrew.  

**Modern**

**Paleo**

**Symbolic Meaning**

ח

𐤇

a wall, fence, separation, or enclosure

ד

𐤃

door, gate, move, transition

ש

𐤔

teeth, fire, light, menorah, shine, whiteness

Putting the letters together (ח + ד + ש = ḥōḏeš), the word evokes **a protected enclosure (****ח****) entering through a gate/door (****ד****) and transformed by fire/light/menorah/whiteness (****ש****)** — a vivid picture of the moon moving into its complete, enclosed circle of bright shining whiteness or light. This isn’t a dark or partial phase (which lacks enclosure or light and whiteness); it’s the one night the moon is fully “enclosed” in perfection, and “lit up” like fire, and standing in one of the 12 pearly, moon like, gates which are often associated with the constellations, the Mazzaroth, or zodiac of the heavenly tabernacle.

The image fits the full moon without force, aligning with the Bible’s own use of the word for renewal to completeness. These letters also note dividing or separation of months as the gate/wall between one month and the next. The shining whiteness is hard to connect to a dark moon.

  

  

The Eternal Witness and the “One” Moon

The theological weight for the full moon is sealed by God’s eternal oath in Psalm 89, where the _specific_ grammar points to the full moon as the perfect, unchanging witness.

  

_“_**_Once_** _(ʾaḥath, feminine) I have sworn by My holiness… His throne shall be established forever like the sun before Me,_ **_like the_**  **_moon_**_— a_ **_faithful witness_** > *in the sky.”*

> — Psalms 89:35–37

  

The unusual feminine Hebrew word **_ʾaḥath_** (“one/once”) is used deliberately. It bypasses the normal masculine form (_ʾeḥād_) to reference the unique “_oneness_” or “_completeness_” of the perfectly full moon which is also feminine. This “faithful witness” must be reliable and complete, mirroring the unchanging nature of the “_Father of lights_” and in stark contrast to the human “_witnesses_” used by tradition. In mathematical terms the moon goes from 0 to 1 or from nothing to fullness.

  

A Perfect Gift without Shadow of Turning

  

_Every good gift and_ **_every perfect gift_** _is from above, and cometh down_ **_from the Father of lights_**_, with whom is no variableness,_ **_nor_**  **_shadow of turning._**

_—James 1:17_

  

This verse from James makes an explicit reference to the “_Father of Lights_” to bring the context of the heavens and the perfect, complete, full gift which has no “_shadow of turning_”. Shadow of turning perfectly describes **the dark or crescent moon** and establishes that it **is not associated with the Father of Lights**. God’s law and timekeeping must be perfect and unchanging. The full moon is the physically most stable, perfect, and visually complete phase. To use the dark moon or fleeting, variable crescent moon is to follow “**_shadows of turning_**” and “traditions of men” that nullify Torah truth.

Deuteronomy tells us the **sun, moon, and stars are a gift** or allotment given to all mankind, not to worship as gods like the god-names given to the Gregorian days of the week, but for the appointed times.

  

_Lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and see_ **_the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven_**_, and be drawn away and bow down to them and serve them — those which YHUH your_ **_God has allotted / apportioned / given_** > *as a portion to all the peoples under the whole heaven.”*

> — Deuteronomy 4:19

  

  

The Twelve Pearly Gates

  

_“It had a great, high wall with_ **_twelve gates_**_, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the_ **_twelve tribes_** _of the sons of Israel were inscribed … And the_ **_twelve gates were twelve pearls_**_; each_ **_one_** _of the gates was a_ **_single pearl_**_.” — Revelation 21:12_

  

This verse deliberately repeats the word “one / single” twice in a single verse connecting it to the “_once I have sworn_” and the full moon faithful witness. The ancient Hebrew copy of Revelation, likely its original form, uses the **exact same root** (א־ח־ד) used in Psalm 89:38 for the moon’s “_once_” (אַחַת) — its one single night of perfect oneness.

Scripture repeatedly calls the heavens God’s tabernacle / dwelling place and all dwellings have gates or doors:  

_He who_ **_stretches out the heavens_** _like a curtain, and spreads them_ **_like a tabernacle to dwell in._**> *”*

> — Isaiah 40:22

  

_In the heavens_ **_God has pitched a tent for the sun_**_._

_It is like a bridegroom_ **_coming out of his chamber (through a gate/door)_**_, like a champion rejoicing to run his course. It rises at one end of the heavens_

> *and makes its circuit to the other;*
> — Psalms 19:4-6

  

_“Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? Canst thou bring forth_ **_Mazzaroth in his season_**_? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons? Do you know the ordinances of the_ **_heavens_**> *? Can you establish their rule on the earth?”*

> — Job 38:33 

  

With these verses we establish that the Mazzaroth (the constellations in the Zodiac) are connected the times and seasons and are the gates associated with the months and named after the 12 tribes of Israel. The twelve tribes were encamped around the tabernacle in the wilderness in the **exact same order** as the twelve signs of the Mazzaroth. For example, Leo the Lion is associated with the tribe of Judah.

This aligns with the meaning of the Hebrew letters that describe the renewed moon as an enclosed light in a door/gate and matches the imagery of the Pearly Gates containing One Whole Single Pearl like a Full Moon sitting among the stars.

  

Zodiac and the 12 Tribes

  

**Tribe**

Calls Naphtali a "doe let loose" with beautiful words; Promises full favor and possession. Capricorn's goat-fish hybrid represents ambition, agility, and watery depths.

  

  

  

  

The East Gate and the Full Moon

Ezekiel gives us the clearest, most concrete calendar instruction in the entire prophetic future temple when he gives the instructions to open the East Gate on the day of the Renewed Moon.

  

_“Thus says the Lord GOD: The gate of the inner court that faces_ **_east_** _shall be shut the six working days, but on the_ **_Sabbath_** _it shall be opened, and on the_ **_day of the new moon_** _it shall be opened … The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that_ **_east gate_** _before the LORD on the_ **_Sabbaths_** _and on the_ **_new moons_**> *.”*

> — Ezekiel 46:1–3

  

This instruction tells us to look east, where the sun and moon rise and open the gate. The earthly tabernacle is a reflection of the heavenly tabernacle.

  

_They serve at a_ **_sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven_**> *. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: 'See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.*

> — Hebrews 8:5

  

From this we can infer that the signs in the heavens should follow the instructions on earth. The full moon, a faithful witness, should stand in the east gate or constellation on Renewed Moon Day. As the earth orbits the sun the constellation will change, and each month brings a new constellation.

This instruction says we should worship or bow down or face east, so a sign like the sliver moon in the west is fundamentally incompatible.

  

The Testimony of Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)

The argument presented thus far for the full-moon calendar system has relied exclusively on a literal, internal analysis of the Hebrew Scriptures (the _Tanakh_). We have deliberately dismissed mainstream Jewish and Christian traditions based on the scriptural warnings against the “commandments of men” that “nullify the word of God” (Mark 7:13).

However, a question remains: Is this full-moon interpretation a purely modern invention, an modern idea read back into the text?

To answer this, we can utilize extra biblical texts like the Book of **Sirach** (Ecclesiasticus) as _historical documents_ — not inspired Scripture — to confirm the existence and cultural plausibility of the concepts we’ve derived from the Bible alone.

Sirach is part of the Apocrypha, accepted as canonical by some traditions (Catholic/Orthodox) but excluded from the Hebrew and most Protestant canons. We do not use it to establish doctrine, but to establish **historical context**.

Using a historical document does not violate _Sola Scriptura_. It is the same as using Josephus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, or even a modern encyclopedia to understand the cultural landscape or vocabulary of the time. It confirms that the specific interpretation derived from Genesis 1 and Psalms 81 was a recognizable idea within the ancient Jewish world.

  

_“He made_ **_the moon_** _also to serve in her season (gates) for a declaration of times, and a sign of the world. From the moon is the sign of feasts,_ **_a light_** _that_ **_decreases in her perfection_** _(plērōma/fullness/totality/completion)._ **_The month is called after her name_**> *, increasing wonderfully in her changing, being an instrument of the armies above, shining in the firmament of heaven…”*

> — Sirach 43:6–8

  

This passage confirms that in the minds of some Jewish writers living around 200–175 BC, the **“sign of feasts”** was explicitly linked to the moon’s **“perfection”,** **“fullness”, or “totality”** (_plērōma_). Scripture assigns feasts as days of the month; therefore, the sign of the feasts is the sign for the start of the month. The verse also follows the pattern of perfection, decreasing then increasing again just like the moon does through the month.

Interpretations favoring a dark conjunction or sighted crescent as the month's beginning introduce unnecessary strain. A dark-start view redefines plērōma as an endpoint of waning (fading to invisibility) rather than its literal peak of completion and brightness, despite the preposition ἐν ("in/at") placing the decrease squarely within that full state. The text omits any reference to darkness, concealment, or renewal from obscurity, beginning its emphasis at illuminated perfection. A crescent view, meanwhile, elevates the "marvelous increase" of verse 8 as the renewal sign while demoting plērōma to a secondary mid-month event, inverting the sequence: it would require starting with waxing, reaching perfection, then waning—contrary to the flow from plērōma-initiated decrease to contrasting increase. Such readings often depend on looser translations that shift "in her perfection" toward "after completing its course" or imply waning follows fullness separately, but the Greek syntax keeps decrease tied directly to the state of plērōma.

In its simplest, unbiased reading, Sirach 43:6–8 celebrates the moon's cycle with fullness as the focus: the point of perfected light where observable change begins (decrease), followed by the beauty of growth amid phases. This portrayal lends Second Temple-era plausibility to a full-moon monthly start, where the heavens declare appointed times through visible glory rather than hidden absence, preserving the text's elegant astronomical hymn without added assumptions or reordered logic.

This historical usage lends support to our linguistic interpretation of _keseh_ in Psalms 81:3. It proves that our reading — that the moon’s completion or oneness is the marker for the appointed times — was a viable and circulating concept in antiquity, not a modern eisegesis (reading our own meaning into the text).

The existence of a text like Sirach counters the mainstream assertion that the full-moon calendar is a radical, fringe idea. It was a plausibly known tradition during the Second Temple period, a time of intense calendrical debate (evidenced by finds among the Dead Sea Scrolls).

While mainstream Judaism ultimately coalesced around the dark/sliver moon calendar after the Temple’s destruction, Sirach serves as evidence that other, highly developed Jewish perspectives existed that favored the full moon as the authoritative marker.

  

Abraham Covenant on a Dark Day

The precise alignment between Abraham's covenant in Genesis 15 and the Exodus from Egypt in Exodus 12 supports a full-moon commencement for the scriptural month. Scripture presents these events as occurring on the "selfsame night" exactly 430 years apart, with matching lunar conditions. The timing of darkness and departure fits naturally with a month starting at full moon.

  

_And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of_ **_great darkness fell_** _upon him….And it came to pass, that,_ **_when the sun went down, and it was dark_**> *, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces."*

> — Genesis 15:12, 17

  

The emphasis is on total darkness—no lunar light is present or implied. The covenant seals under a moonless sky during the night portion of the day.  

_Now_ **_the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years_**_. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even_ **_the selfsame day it came to pass_**> *, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.”*

> — Exodus 12:40–41

  

This departure is specified as the night of the 15th of the first month (Abib/Nisan), the evening of the first day of Unleavened Bread. For the 15th's night portion to be naturally dark (matching Genesis 15's "great darkness"), the month must start at the full moon

  

  

_And they departed from Rameses in the first month,_ **_on the fifteenth day of the first month_**> *; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians."*

> — Numbers 33:3

  

In a traditional crescent-based calendar the full moon falls around the 14th–15th. This would make the Exodus night brightly illuminated by a near-full moon—breaking the "selfsame" dark-night parallel with Abraham's covenant. This is an example of the principle of the Narrative revealing the calendar implicitly rather than explicitly stating it.

  

The Fading Light of Youth

Ecclesiastes 12 presents one of Scripture's most poignant depictions of human aging and the inevitable decline of vitality. The Teacher uses vivid astronomical metaphors to describe how the brightness of youth gradually dims:

  

_Remember also your Creator_ **_in the days of your youth_**_,_ **_before the evil (dark) days_** _come and the years draw near of which you will say, 'I have no pleasure in them';_ **_before the sun light and the moon and the stars are darkened_** > *and the clouds return after the rain…*

> — Ecclesiastes 12:1–2

  

The sequence is deliberate: first the **sun** (greatest light, governing the day), then the **light** itself, then the **moon**, and finally the **stars** are darkened. This progression mirrors the natural order of celestial decline as perceived from earth—daylight fades, moonlight wanes, and even starlight seems diminished under clouds or failing vision. The imagery is not random; it evokes a complete cycle of brightness giving way to obscurity, just as the body loses strength and the spirit returns to God (v. 7).

If we apply this celestial analogy to the lunar month, the parallel becomes striking. The "youth" of the month should correspond to its brightest, most vigorous phase, just as human youth is marked by peak strength and illumination. Only the **full moon** fits this description:

-   It is the moment of maximum light, when the moon governs the entire night with undiminished radiance
-   From that point of perfection, the light begins to fade night by night—waning through gibbous, quarter, crescent, until darkness envelops the mid-month period.
-   The "darkening of the moon" in Ecclesiastes 12:2 thus finds its monthly echo in the waning phase that follows fullness, not in a faint beginning or invisible start.

  

A month that begins in darkness or a slender crescent would invert the analogy: its "youth" would be the weakest, least visible phase, with brightness increasing only later. This reverses the natural pattern the Teacher describes—youth as brightness that fades, not obscurity that grows. Scripture consistently portrays renewal as restoration to completeness (ḥāḏaš = to make fresh/perfect, as in Ezekiel 36:26 or Psalm 51:10), not a tentative emergence from nothing. The full moon alone embodies that restored perfection at the month's outset, after which the light predictably declines, mirroring the Teacher's warning that the years of strength give way to the "evil days" of diminishment.

This lunar parallel is not mere poetic license. The moon is God's appointed "_faithful witness in the sky_" (Psalm 89:37), and its cycle is meant to teach us about time, seasons, and the human condition (Psalm 104:19). Just as youth begins in full vigor and fades toward the end, so the biblical month begins in full lunar glory and wanes toward mid-month darkness—setting the stage for major appointed times (Passover, Sukkot) to fall during the darkest nights, illuminated only by divine light (as in the pillar of fire during the Exodus). Then we are reborn on first fruits as Jesus was raised from the dead with the first visible crescent and ultimately we are fully renewed. To start the month in weakness or concealment would contradict both the astronomical witness and the life-cycle imagery Scripture uses to instruct us.

In this light, Ecclesiastes 12 reinforces the fuller biblical portrait: the moon's "youth" is its perfected fullness, not its hidden or partial beginning. The month that starts at full moon honors the Creator's design—beginning with brightness that fades, just as our days under the sun begin strong and draw toward their close.

  

The Predictability of the Renewed Moon

Another compelling arguments for the full-moon commencement of the biblical month emerges not from complex linguistic debates but from the simple, practical reality of observation and the way Scripture assumes people could know the day in advance. The narrative in 1 Samuel 20 provides a clear window into this reality, while the mechanics of lunar visibility reveal why a crescent-based system creates uncertainty that the text does not reflect.

In 1 Samuel 20:5, David speaks to Jonathan with confidence: “_Behold, to morrow is the new moon [ḥodesh], and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat…_” Later, Saul expects David at the table on that day (vv. 24–27). The statement “_tomorrow is the new moon_” is made the day before, and both men treat it as a known, reliable fact around which royal plans and meals are arranged. The king’s court and household operate as if the day is certain—no mention of waiting to see if the moon appears, no contingency for clouds or poor visibility, no suggestion that the day might shift by a night or two. This level of advance certainty is difficult to reconcile with a system dependent on sighting the first visible crescent.

While it's true that one could roughly "predict" a crescent by averaging the lunar cycle (29–30 days) or using basic math from previous observations, the exact day of visibility remains inherently uncertain in a pure observation-based system. The thin crescent is only visible for a short window after sunset, and factors like weather, atmospheric conditions, horizon obstructions, or the moon's precise age after conjunction can delay sighting by 1–3 days. Even with averaging, there's no guarantee—clouds could obscure it, forcing a wait. This unpredictability is captured in the biblical idiom for Yom Teruah (the new moon feast of the seventh month), often called "_the day and hour no one knows"_ (echoing Matthew 24:36). In a crescent system, the day isn't confirmed until witnesses actually see the sliver, making advance announcements like David's risky or imprecise. A dark conjunction system requires calculation as observation alone is ambiguous as 2 to 3 nights in a row could have no visible moon.

By contrast, the full moon is the easiest lunar phase to predict and confirm through observation alone:

-   It is visible for nearly the entire night (~10–12 hours), rising near sunset and setting near sunrise.
-   Its appearance is unmistakable: a fully illuminated disk that clearly indicates the moon's phase.
-   **Advance predictability**: The night before Renewed Moon Day, observe when the moon sets. If the moon sets while the sun is still **6° above the horizon** (during afternoon daylight), this predicts that the next morning a full-looking moon will be visible at **12° above the western horizon at first light**. This 6°/12° rule provides objective, observable criteria for determining when the month begins, requiring no astronomical calculations.
-   **Renewed Moon Day timing**: In a full moon calendar, the month begins at first light after the full moon (Renewed Moon Day), when the waning gibbous moon is 12-24° above the western horizon at dawn (about 1 hour before sunrise). At sunrise, the moon would be approximately 24-36° above the western horizon, depending on the exact waning phase. This provides a clear, observable marker for the start of each month.

This observational asymmetry is decisive. A crescent-based system introduces real uncertainty: tomorrow might not show a visible crescent, forcing a delay and disrupting plans. A full-moon system allows confident advance knowledge: count the days, observe the waxing progression, and the bright, unmistakable full disk will appear as expected. The narrative in 1 Samuel 20 assumes exactly this kind of certainty—no hesitation, no “_if we see it_,” no waiting for sighting. David and Jonathan plan around the day as if it is fixed and known. The king’s table is set with the expectation that the day has arrived. This fits the full moon far more naturally than a weather-dependent sliver.

  

The Solar Eclipse At the Cross

The darkness during Jesus’ crucifixion was foretold in the Old Testament as a sign of divine judgment and redemption. In Amos 8:9, the prophet declares:

  

> *“And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.”*
> — Amos 8:9

  

This prophecy describes a darkening of the sun at midday—“in the clear day”— as in an solar eclipse, not an ordinary sunset. The event at the cross is consistent with this with added supernatural enhancement: Matthew 27:45 records that “_from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour_” (noon to 3 p.m.). Mark 15:33 and Luke 23:44–45 confirm the same three-hour period, with Luke noting that “_the sun was darkened._” This was no brief or routine phenomenon; it lasted far longer than any possible solar eclipse (maximum ~7.5 minutes) and covered “_the whole land_,” indicating a supernatural intervention.

The timing is explicit in the Gospels: the crucifixion took place during Passover, on or near the 14th of Nisan (Matthew 26:17–19; Mark 14:12–16; Luke 22:7–13; John 19:14). Leviticus 23:5 places the Passover sacrifice “_at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month_,” with the feast beginning that evening. This mid-month placement is fixed in Scripture.

A solar eclipse—the only natural cause of daytime solar darkness—requires the moon to be in its dark moon phase (aligned between Earth and Sun, invisible from Earth). This alignment occurs roughly two weeks after the full moon. At full moon, the moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun—making a solar eclipse astronomically impossible. Observers familiar with lunar cycles would have immediately recognized and recorded a solar eclipse when the moon was at or near full. Yet all ancient records merely record it as an unusual solar eclipse.

This impossibility is decisive for the calendar question. If the month began at the full moon, the waning phase would naturally bring the dark/new moon around days 14–15, making mid-month the darkest time of the lunar cycle. The crucifixion darkness, occurring precisely during this naturally dark mid-month period, would then be supernaturally intensified—light withdrawn during the sacrifice of the Lamb, fulfilling the prophetic word of Amos 8:9 without requiring an impossible eclipse. The predictable solar eclipse serves as a historic marker of the event that aids in identifying the year of the cross.

A dark or crescent month start would place the full moon mid-month (around the 14th–15th), which contradicts the emphasis on total, unnatural darkness when covenants are cut — remember Abraham. Only a full-moon start aligns the mid-month timing with the natural lunar darkness that the event amplified. The three hours of midday darkness, occurring at the time of the Passover sacrifice, fits the pattern of God using and intensifying His created signs (Genesis 1:14) for redemptive purposes.

  

  

  

  

  

We will spend a whole chapter proving that the calendar day begins at first light, so for now simply assume that the analogy to the day beginning in darkness is built on a false premise and if you want to use that kind of analogy to support the start of the month in darkness then it will ultimately turn the tables and support the full moon to start the month.

**Clarification on Lunar Orbit and Visibility**: Earth rotates eastward, but from our perspective, the moon appears to move westward across the sky (opposite to Earth's rotation direction), though slower than the sun and stars. The moon's apparent daily motion is about 12-13° westward relative to the sun, causing it to rise 50 minutes later each day. The full moon occurs when the moon is opposite the sun, rising at sunset and setting at sunrise, making it visible all night. On Renewed Moon Day (the morning after full moon), the waning gibbous moon sets about 50 minutes after sunrise, making it visible at first light (dawn) when it's 12-24° above the western horizon, and at sunrise when it's approximately 24-36° above the horizon.

  

  

  

Summary

Here is a concise bullet-point summary of the chapter's key evidence for the full-moon month start. This list is designed so we  can quickly grasp the **magnitude and cumulative weight** of the case, with all 15 points standing as an independent line of reasoning from Scripture, astronomy, narrative, or historical context.  

1.  **Creation Mandate – The Moon as a "Great Light" to Govern the Night** Genesis 1:16 and Psalm 136:8–9 require the lesser light to rule the night with the stars. Only the full moon remains visible from dusk to dawn, co-ruling the entire night alongside constellations (dual witness). Crescent vanishes quickly after sunset, dark moon provides no light at all.
2.  **Two or Three Witnesses Principle** Deuteronomy 19:15 (and parallels) demands matters be established by two or three witnesses. Full moon + stars provide concurrent, visible testimony all night; crescent is brief/lone, dark moon absent. The moon and stars are faithful witnesses in the sky (Psalm 89:37).
3.  **Psalm 81:3 – Direct Equation of Renewed Moon (ḥodesh) with Full Moon (keseh)** Synonymous poetic parallelism without an inserted “and” equates the blowing of the shofar on the renewed moon with the full moon for the day of our feast. No comparable verse defines a dark or sliver moon as the start.
4.  **Ḥodesh / Ḥāḏaš Root – Renewal Means Restoration to Perfection** Every biblical use of ḥāḏaš (renew) describes complete restoration to wholeness (new heart, renewed strength, renewed altar, renewed earth). Only the full moon visually embodies full restoration after waning; crescent is partial, dark is absence.
5.  **Pictographic Hebrew Letters (ḥ-d-š)** Ancient symbols: enclosure/wall (ḥ) + door/gate (d) + teeth/fire/light/whiteness (š) → enclosed, shining circle of full light passing through a gate. Fits the full moon as the one night it is fully enclosed in perfection and lit like fire/whiteness; hard to connect to dark or partial phase.
6.  **Psalm 89 – The Moon as Faithful Witness of "Oneness"** The feminine “once/ʾaḥath” (unusual) + “faithful witness in the sky” points to the moon’s unique night of perfect completeness (full moon). Contrasts with variable crescent/dark phases.
7.  **James 1:17 – No Shadow of Turning from the Father of Lights** God’s gifts are perfect and unchanging. Full moon is the most stable, visually complete phase; crescent/dark are variable and shadowed, fitting “shadow of turning.”
8.  **Revelation 21:12 – Twelve Single Pearly Gates** Gates are single pearls (one whole, round, white). Echoes Psalm 89’s “once/one” and the full moon as a perfect, luminous circle among the heavenly gates/constellations.
9.  **Mazzaroth and 12 Tribes Alignment** Numbers 2 encampment order matches the 12 zodiac signs (Genesis 49 / Deuteronomy 33 animal imagery). Renewed moon (enclosed light in a gate) fits full moon standing in the heavenly tabernacle gates each month.
10.  **Ezekiel 46:1–3 – East Gate Opens on Renewed Moon** Inner east gate opens on new moon for worship (people face east). Full moon rises in the east at sunset, visible during night worship; crescent rises in the west after sunset, incompatible with eastward orientation.
11.  **Sirach 43:6–8 – Sign of Feasts from Moon’s Perfection (plērōma)** Second Temple text links the “sign of feasts” to the moon’s fullness where light decreases, then marvels at increase. Sequence (perfection → decrease → increase) matches full-moon start; mid-month full in dark/sliver inverts the order.
12.  **Abraham Covenant & Exodus Parallel – Selfsame Dark Night on 15th** Genesis 15 covenant sealed in total darkness; Exodus 12:40–41 departure on “selfsame day” 430 years later (Numbers 33:3 – 15th). For mid-month (15th) to be naturally dark, month must start at full moon (waning to dark mid-month). Crescent start would make 15th near full/bright.
13.  **Ecclesiastes 12 – Youthful Brightness Fades to Dark "Evil Days"** Youth = peak brightness (sun/light/moon/stars); old age = darkening. Month "youth" = full moon (brightest phase), fading to mid-month darkness. Inverts if month starts dark/crescent (youth = weakest phase).
14.  **1 Samuel 20 – Advance Certainty of "Tomorrow is the New Moon"** David announces “tomorrow is the new moon” with confidence; Saul expects him. Full moon is unmistakable and predictable days in advance (waxing progression visible at sunset). Crescent is weather-dependent, uncertain, often delayed 1–3 days.
15.  **Crucifixion Darkness (Amos 8:9 Prophecy & Eclipse Impossibility)** Amos 8:9 prophesied sun darkened at noon. Crucifixion darkness (3 hours, noon–3 p.m.) occurred during Passover (14th–15th). Solar eclipse impossible at full moon. Mid-month darkness only natural if month starts at full moon (waning to dark mid-month). Supernatural intensification of natural lunar darkness.  
    

This list captures the **breadth and interlocking nature** of the evidence: direct textual equations, semantic consistency, astronomical observation, narrative predictability, prophetic alignment, and historical plausibility. Each point stands on its own yet reinforces the others, building a cumulative case that the full moon—not the dark or sliver—serves as the visible, perfect, and predictable sign God appointed for times and seasons.
