The Path to Salvation

The vast majority of the “church” has been taught that keeping his commandments is a “works based salvation” and that the old testament and its laws are no longer relevant. We are not saved by our works, but we can be condemned by willful, unrepentant breaking of his commands and denying their truth.

> Do not think that I (Yeshua) came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill (to cause to abound, to bring to realization, to establish, to bring to fullness). For assuredly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot (punctuation) or one tittle will pass from the law till all is fulfilled. Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least (or nothing) in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

> — Matthew 5:17-10 

Yeshua came to explain the law and everything he taught can be found in the old testament. It is the old testament that spoke of Yeshua through prophecy of the coming Messiah; therefore, the Messiah’s first and now second coming is part of his word, his law, and it must be fulfilled. 

> For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries. 

> — Hebrews 10:26-27

What is sin? How do we know it?

> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”

> — Romans 7:7

> Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.

> — 1 John 3:4

What is “the truth” that we have received knowledge of? We must be careful not to rely solely on dictionary definitions of words which often change over time. The Bible is symbolic and defines its own terms so that the meaning can survive translation errors and language evolution and be carried through many different languages. We must let the Bible define its own terms, this is the key to understanding the Bible.

> Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. 

> — Psalm 119:142

Righteousness is a way of referring to the keeping of the law and the Psalms just declared it to be everlasting, never ending, and the truth. With this definition, Hebrews 10:26 can be understood to say if “if we sin willfully after we have received knowledge of the law (of Moses)”.
This is supported by Paul immediately bringing up the law of Moses after talking about willful sinning.

> Anyone who has rejected Moses’ law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace? For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. And  again, “𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 will judge His people.” It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄.

> — Hebrews 10:28-31

Once we have knowledge of the law we must profess it to be the truth and ask for forgiveness when our flesh continues to break it. If you deny the truth, the law, then you are willfully sinning and denying Yeshua as your Lord/Master. 

> But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. 

> — Matthew 10:33

> For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words (which come from his Father via Moses and the Prophets), of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father’s, and of the holy angels.

> — Luke 9:26

Yeshua is “the way, the truth (the law, the word), the life” and the law is “the truth”; therefore, by denying His law, his words, you are denying Yeshua and He will deny you before his Father, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. 
The testimony of Yeshua is his advocating for us as our High Priest. 

> Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Yeshua the Son of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted (tested) like we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

> — Hebrews 4:14

It is the High Priest who makes intersession on behalf of the people and who presents the sacrifice to cover the sins of the people. Yeshua presents his own blood to cover our unintentional sins and those sins for which we have repented. 
Yeshua’s role as our High Priest is defined by the old testament law that clearly identifies that willfully and defiantly ignoring the law is blaspheming 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 (aka grieving the spirit of grace).

The priest (Yeshua) shall make atonement before 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 for the person who commits an error when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him so that he may be forgiven. You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, whether he is native-born among the Israelites or a stranger who is living among them as a resident alien.  
> But the person who does [anything wrong] willfully and defiantly, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one is blaspheming 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, and that person shall be cut off from among his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 

> — Numbers 15:28–30 AMP

> Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works (beginning, old ways); or else I will come unto thee quickly (suddenly), and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.

> — Revelation 2:5

Works Based Salvation?
So then, is keeping the law a works based salvation? No. It is only by the Law that we have a High Priest in Yeshua who intercedes on our behalf for unintentional sins, providing the blood and testimony of Yeshua, to forgive our unintentional sins and those sins (law breaking) that we have repented (turned) from. His role as our High Priest is established by the law, and by the law there is no means of salvation except through that High Priest’s intercession and blood. 

> Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not. So likewise you, when you have done all those things which you are commanded, say, ‘We are unprofitable servants. We have done what was our duty to do.’ 

> — Luke 17:9–10

Yeshua makes it very clear that obedience isn’t earning our salvation. We are in debt because of our sins and the wages of sin is death, but the gift of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is eternal life (Romans 6:23). If we could earn something by obeying then obeying would have been optional. As servants we have nothing that our creator didn’t give us in the first place; therefore, we owe him our very life. When we sin we owe him even more; therefore, the more we sin the greater our debt grows and the first rule of getting out of the hole is to stop digging. Stop sinning! 


The typical three step path to salvation is:

Admit that you are a sinner (law breaker)
Believe that Yeshua paid for your sin on the cross
Confess that Yeshua is Lord (Master) and Call on Him for Salvation

You cannot complete the first step without knowing what it means to be a sinner, that is, without knowing the law which you broke. You cannot accept the second step without believing the law provides a High Priest, demands a sacrifice, and prophecies of a Messiah, and that Yeshua meets the requirements of the law and prophets. And you cannot complete the final step without submitting to follow Yeshua as your master. And who is Yeshua except the word and the law made flesh who does nothing except what his Father said, and that which was written in the old testament.  

> I am able to do nothing of Myself. As I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My will, but the will of the One (𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄) having sent Me. 

> — John 5:30

> So Yeshua replied, "Truly, truly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing by Himself, unless He sees the Father doing it. For whatever the Father does, the Son also does.

> — John 5:19

> For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me. 

> — John 6:38

Yeshua is our Judge and High Priest and everything he says and does is as he heard from 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄. Yeshua himself followed the law, doing only that which 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 spoke. An in-depth study of everything Yeshua did and said will show that everything he taught can be found in the old testament. 

> A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher. 

> — Luke 6:40

> Then said Yeshua unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

> — Matthew 16:24-26

If you aspire to be a Christian, a “like-Christ”, then your aim is to be like him, to walk has he walked, and to do nothing unless we see the Father, 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, doing so or commanding so, as it is written in the old and new testaments. If you are living through the tribulation, then Matthew 16:26 is the number one warning to keep in mind. 

Go and Sin No More
Sin is the transgression of the law; therefore, when Yeshua says “go and sin no more” it can be understood as “go and keep the law”.  Once we have been made well, by calling upon Yeshua to save us from our breaking of the law, we cannot keep willfully breaking it.

> And Yeshua said unto her, “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more”. 

> — John 8:11

> Afterward Yeshua found him in the temple, and said to him, “See, you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.” 

> — John 5:14

Notice that the penalty for sinning, also known as breaking the law after being healed, is worse than if we had never been healed or saved in the first place. This lines up exactly with what Paul said 

> Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 underfoot… 

> — Hebrews 10:29

The most obvious way to willfully break the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 is to claim there is no law, it has been done away with, and that you do not have to follow it because “Yeshua has paid the price for you not following it”. 

> Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. Whoever abides in Him does not sin (willfully). Whoever sins (willfully) has neither seen Him nor known Him.

> — 1 John 3:4-6

“Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ “And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.’ 
— Matthew 7:22-23

All Have Sinned & Continue to Sin

> For I (Paul) do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. 

> — Romans 7:15

If sinning after coming to Yeshua is even worse than never knowing Yeshua, then who can be saved? Even Paul, author of most of the New Testament, admits that he continues to do the very thing he hates, sin.  

> For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; 

> — Romans 3:23

Based upon the fundamental truth that all have sinned, all are deserving of death and there is nothing of our own power we can do to have salvation except pray for His mercy and have faith in His finished work on the cross. 

 He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. 
— John 8:12

> And ye shall know the truth (the law), and the truth shall make you free… Yeshua answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commits sin is the servant (slave) of sin. And the servant abides not in the house for ever: but the Son abides ever. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.  

> — John 8:34

While in the flesh we are at war with sin and lawlessness. This war was described by Paul in Romans 7:

> If, then, I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good. But now, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. 

> — Romans 7:16

The first thing to notice is that Paul declared the law good in his mind and spirit. If we do not agree that the law is good then we are in agreement with the sin that dwells within us. Paul states that this sin-nature, inherited from Adam, has enslaved our flesh. Sin is “personified” like a demon having influence over our flesh causing us to act contrary to our mind and will.

For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for the will (to follow the Law) is present with me, but how to perform what is good (the Law) I do not find. For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will (desire) not to do (breaking the law), that I practice. Now if I do what I will not to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me.

I find then a law (authority) that is the evil present with me, the one who wills to do good (the law). 

For I delight in the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 according to the inward man (mind and spirit). 

But I see another law (authority) in my members (flesh), warring against the law (authority) of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law (authority) of sin which is in my members.

O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄—through Yeshua Christ our Lord!

> So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, but with the flesh the law of sin. 

> — Romans 7:16-25

How then shall we be saved?
This chapter went into great depth to highlight that salvation depends upon confessing that the law (of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 via Moses and the Prophets) is good. We must be willing to obey the law in our mind and spirit even if the flesh continues to enslave us to sin against our will.

> That if you confess with your mouth, “Yeshua is Lord,” and believe in your heart that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 

> — Romans 10:9

This simple verse means confessing that Yeshua is Lord. Yeshua does nothing that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 didn’t tell him (as documented in the Old Testament). He came to fulfill and establish the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 documented by Moses and the Prophets. Confessing Yeshua to be Lord means he is your master and that your desire and will is to do nothing Yeshua hasn’t commanded you. And if Yeshua only commands what 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 commands, then we should desire to do all that 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 commands. 
If that is the desire of your mind and heart then you will do your best to keep the law of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 even if you occasionally sin. It means that when you become aware of your sin, breaking the law, you immediately repent and stop sinning. If you deny the law with your mouth, you have denied Yeshua as Lord and he will deny you. 

> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Yeshua for good works, which 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. 

> — Ephesians 2:8–10

Our salvation is not a result of works which means no one can boast they are saved because of their works. I certainly wouldn’t want my salvation to depend upon my works because, like Paul, I do what I hate and not what I teach. We are saved because we make Yeshua our Lord and follow the Law of his Father to the best of our ability and with the help of his Holy Spirit. 
Can one have salvation without repentance? What is repentance except the turning from sin to obedience? Obedience is the logical outcome of confessing him to be your Lord. Is preaching obedience a works-based salvation or is attempted obedience the evidence of faith? Why try to obey unless you have faith that Yeshua’s blood will cover your failures? Did Yeshua’s death on the cross free us from any obligation to attempt obedience?

> So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good. 

> — Romans 7:12

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 
— Matthew 7:21

What is doing the Father’s will except being obedient to the least of his commands? Is perfect obedience possible? Not in the flesh. Is perfect obedience required for salvation, No. But a mind and heart of obedience is.
Many say “Lord, Lord”, confessing with their mouth, but their actions show a rebellion to seeking to understand and follow His commands. They say in their hearts, “There are no laws or commands because I am forgiven of all sin”. This is like a reckless driver claiming there are no rules of the road because someone has paid his tickets. When you say “Lord, Lord” you are saying “master, master”, and how can someone be your “master” unless you attempt to obey their commands?
