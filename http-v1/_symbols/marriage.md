## Key Proof Texts

### God as Husband

> "For thy Maker is thine **husband**; the LORD of hosts is his name" — Isaiah 54:5

> "Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am **married** unto you" — Jeremiah 3:14

> "I will **betroth** thee unto me for ever; yea, I will **betroth** thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies" — Hosea 2:19

### Christ as Bridegroom

> "He that hath the **bride** is the **bridegroom**" — John 3:29

> "I have **espoused** you to one **husband**, that I may present you as a chaste **virgin** to Christ" — 2 Corinthians 11:2

> "the **marriage** of the Lamb is come, and his **wife** hath made herself ready" — Revelation 19:7

### The Marriage Supper

> "Blessed are they which are called unto the **marriage supper** of the Lamb" — Revelation 19:9

---

## Divorce: The Covenant Picture Broken

### God Divorced Israel

> "And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a **bill of divorce**" — Jeremiah 3:8

God Himself divorced Israel for **idolatry** (spiritual adultery).

### Grounds for Divorce

**Matthew 5:32** — "saving for the cause of **fornication**"
**Matthew 19:9** — "except it be for **fornication**"

Since FORNICATION = Idolatry (not sexual sin), divorce is permitted when a spouse becomes an idolater.

## The Redundancy Test: Why "Fornication" Cannot Mean Sexual Sin

**Critical Logical Proof:**

Under Torah, the penalty for sexual adultery is **DEATH**:

> "the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be **put to death**" — Leviticus 20:10

> "they shall **both of them die**" — Deuteronomy 22:22

**If adultery = death penalty, then:**
1. You don't NEED a divorce provision for sexual sin
2. The marriage ends by **execution**, not paperwork
3. Therefore "fornication" in Matthew 5/19 must mean something else

**Fornication = Idolatry** — the symbolic meaning resolves the apparent redundancy.

## When Divorce Is COMMANDED

**Ezra 10:3** — "let us make a covenant with our God to **put away all the wives**"

Ezra didn't merely *permit* divorce from idolatrous wives — he **commanded** it. The Israelites had married foreign women who brought idolatry into the community.

**2 Corinthians 6:14** — "Be ye not **unequally yoked** together with unbelievers"

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Spouse commits sexual adultery | Death penalty (Torah) |
| Spouse commits fornication (idolatry) | Divorce **permitted** |
| Unequally yoked to an idolater | Divorce **commanded** |

Remaining yoked to an idolater is itself **ongoing covenant violation**.

---

## The Covenant Spread Over (WINGS Connection)

Marriage is initiated by "spreading the wing/skirt" over someone:

> "spread therefore thy **skirt** (H3671) over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman" — Ruth 3:9

> "I **spread my skirt** (H3671) over thee... and **entered into a covenant** with thee" — Ezekiel 16:8

WINGS (H3671) = Covenant Covering. To marry is to bring someone under covenant covering.

---

## Baal: Husband AND Lord

The Hebrew word **בַּעַל (baal)** means both:
- **Husband** (Genesis 20:3, Deuteronomy 24:4)
- **Lord/Master** (Hosea 2:16)

This dual meaning shows why idolatry = adultery: to serve another "baal" (lord/master/god) is to take another "husband."

> "thou shalt call me **Ishi** (my husband); and shalt call me no more **Baali** (my lord/master)" — Hosea 2:16

God wants to be known as husband, not as a competing "baal" among many.

---

## Practical Implications

1. **Marriage is not merely a human institution** — it pictures the divine covenant
2. **Faithfulness in marriage** pictures covenant faithfulness to God
3. **Grounds for divorce** = idolatry, not sexual sin (sexual sin = death under Torah)
4. **Unequal yoking** (believer + idolater) may require separation
5. **The "marriage supper of the Lamb"** is the consummation of the covenant

## Summary

**MARRIAGE** symbolizes the **COVENANT** between God and His people.

Human marriage pictures this divine relationship:
- Husband = God/Christ
- Wife = Israel/Church  
- Faithfulness = Covenant obedience
- Adultery = Idolatry

Understanding this unlocks the true meaning of divorce passages: "except for fornication" means "except for idolatry" — because sexual adultery already has its own penalty (death) and doesn't need a divorce provision.
