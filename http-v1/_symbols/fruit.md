# FRUIT — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Works |
| **Two Words** | Deeds / Actions |
| **Sentence** | The visible works, deeds, and actions that result from and reveal the nature of their source—as a tree is known by its fruit, so people are known by their works |

**Opposite**: Barren / Fruitless (no works)

---

## The Explicit Parallel: Works = Fruit

**Galatians 5** provides the clearest proof that FRUIT = WORKS:

| Verse | Term | List |
|-------|------|------|
| **Galatians 5:19** | "the **WORKS** of the flesh are..." | adultery, fornication, idolatry... |
| **Galatians 5:22** | "the **FRUIT** of the Spirit is..." | love, joy, peace, longsuffering... |

Paul uses **WORKS** and **FRUIT** as parallel terms. The "fruit of the Spirit" is not feelings—it's visible **works/actions** produced by the Spirit.

## Known By Their Fruit (Matthew 7:16-20)

> **Matthew 7:16** — "Ye shall know them by their **fruits**. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?"

> **Matthew 7:17** — "Even so every good tree bringeth forth good **fruit**; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil **fruit**."

> **Matthew 7:20** — "Wherefore by their **fruits** ye shall know them."

**The Principle**: You identify the nature of the source (tree/person) by examining the **works** it produces. Fruit = the visible evidence of what something truly is.

## The Vine and Branches (John 15)

> **John 15:2** — "Every branch in me that beareth not **fruit** he taketh away"

> **John 15:4** — "the branch cannot bear **fruit** of itself, except it abide in the vine"

> **John 15:5** — "He that abideth in me... bringeth forth much **fruit**: for without me ye can **do nothing**"

> **John 15:8** — "Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much **fruit**"

Note the connection in v.5: bearing fruit = being able to "do" something. And in v.10:

> **John 15:10** — "If ye **keep my commandments**, ye shall abide in my love"

Bearing fruit = keeping commandments = works of obedience.

## "Fruit Of" Constructions

Scripture uses "fruit of [X]" to mean "the works/results produced by X":

| Phrase | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Fruit of the Spirit** (Gal 5:22) | Works produced by the Spirit |
| **Fruit of the flesh** (Gal 5:19) | Works of the flesh (called "works" explicitly!) |
| **Fruit of the mouth/lips** (Prov 12:14, 18:20, Heb 13:15) | Results/consequences of speech |
| **Fruit of the womb** (Gen 30:2, Ps 127:3, Luke 1:42) | Children = result of conception |
| **Fruit of the land** (Deut 1:25) | Produce = result of the ground |
| **Fruit of righteousness** (Heb 12:11, James 3:18) | Works produced by righteousness |
| **Fruit of hands** (Prov 31:16,31) | Results of labor |

## The Parable of the Sower

In the Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13, Mark 4, Luke 8), seed falls on different soils:

| Soil | Result |
|------|--------|
| Wayside | No fruit (birds take seed) |
| Stony ground | No fruit (no root, withers) |
| **Thorns** | **No fruit** (choked by cares/riches) |
| Good ground | **Much fruit** (30, 60, 100 fold) |

The "fruit" is the **works** produced by receiving the word. Thorns (worldliness) prevent fruit (works).

---

## Fruit of Repentance

> **Matthew 3:8** — "Bring forth therefore **fruits** meet for repentance"

> **Luke 3:8** — "Bring forth therefore **fruits** worthy of repentance"

John the Baptist demanded **works** that demonstrate genuine repentance—not just words or feelings.

## Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to FRUIT |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| **[TREE](/symbols/tree/)** | Nation | Trees produce fruit; a nation is known by its works |
| **[THORNS](/symbols/thorns/)** | Worldly People | Thorns choke fruit (prevent works) |
| **[OIL](/symbols/oil/)** | Proven Works | Fruit (olives) pressed = oil (tested works) |
| **[LIGHT](/symbols/light/)** | Visible Example | Good fruit = visible light/example |
| **[WICKEDNESS](/symbols/wickedness/)** | Lawlessness | Produces bad fruit |

### Tree Connection
We defined **[TREE](/symbols/tree/)** = Nation / Covenant Community.

Therefore:
- **TREE** = the people/nation
- **FRUIT** = the works/deeds of that people/nation

> **Matthew 12:33** — "Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit."

A nation's character is revealed by its collective works.

### Thorns Connection
We defined **[THORNS](/symbols/thorns/)** = Worldly / Choking People.

> **Mark 4:7** — "some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it **yielded no fruit**"

Thorns (worldliness) prevent fruit (works). The cares of the world choke out productive obedience.

## Two Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **IS** | Works — the deeds and actions produced |
| **DOES** | Reveals — shows the nature of the source |

---

## Summary

**FRUIT** = **WORKS / DEEDS / ACTIONS**

- Galatians 5 explicitly parallels "works of the flesh" with "fruit of the Spirit"
- "By their fruits ye shall know them" = by their works ye shall know them
- Bearing fruit = keeping commandments = doing works of obedience
- A tree (nation) is known by its fruit (works)

The "fruit of the Spirit" is not internal feelings—it's visible works that can be observed and by which others can "know" the source.
