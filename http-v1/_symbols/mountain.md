# MOUNTAIN — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Kingdom |
| **Two Words** | Ruling Authority |
| **Sentence** | An established, elevated seat of governmental power from which law and authority are exercised over a territory |

**Opposite**: Valley/Sea = Low position / Chaos / No authority / Instability

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly equates mountains with kingdoms:

- **Revelation 17:9** — "The seven heads **ARE** seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth"
  
  This is the clearest definitional verse. The angel interprets the symbol: mountains = seats of power/kingdoms.

- **Daniel 2:35,44-45** — "the stone...became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth... the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed"
  
  The stone (kingdom) BECOMES a mountain. Mountain = the visible, established form of that kingdom.

- **Jeremiah 51:25** — "Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth"
  
  Babylon is directly called a "mountain"—a kingdom/power that exercises dominion.

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What do mountains DO in Scripture?

| Function | Verse |
|----------|-------|
| **Are ESTABLISHED/EXALTED** | Isaiah 2:2 "shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills" |
| **Nations FLOW to them** | Isaiah 2:2, Micah 4:1 "all nations shall flow unto it" |
| **LAW goes forth FROM them** | Isaiah 2:3, Micah 4:2 "out of Zion shall go forth the law" |
| **God DWELLS there** | Joel 3:17 "the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain" |
| **Exercise RULE** | The "greater light to rule" parallels mountains as seats of rule |

Mountains function as **seats of governmental authority** from which law, teaching, and rule proceed.

### 3. The Behavioral Evidence

How do people relate to mountains?

- **Go UP to them**: Isaiah 2:3 "let us go up to the mountain of the LORD"
- **Submit to their authority**: Nations "flow" to God's mountain
- **Remove them by faith**: Matt 17:20, 21:21 "say unto this mountain, Be thou removed"

The command to "remove mountains" by faith makes sense if mountains = governmental powers/obstacles. Faith can topple kingdoms.

### 4. The Pattern Evidence

Mountains appear in a consistent pattern throughout Scripture:

| Mountain | Represents |
|----------|------------|
| Mount Sinai | Place where God's law/government was given |
| Mount Zion | God's kingdom, His seat of authority |
| Babylon as mountain | World kingdom opposing God |
| Seven mountains (Rev 17) | Seven kingdoms/powers |
| Stone becoming mountain | God's kingdom filling the earth |

In every case, mountain = a seat of ruling authority.

### 5. The Antithetical Evidence

Mountains contrast with:

- **Valleys**: Low places, humiliation, subjection
- **Plains**: Flat terrain, no elevation, no authority
- **Sea**: Chaos, instability, peoples without government (Rev 17:15)

When mountains are "cast into the sea" (Matt 21:21), kingdoms are thrown into chaos/destroyed.

When mountains "melt" or are "moved" (Isa 54:10, Ps 46:2), governments collapse.

### 6. The Christological Evidence

Jesus and mountains:

| Event | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| Sermon on the Mount | Teaching with governmental AUTHORITY |
| Transfiguration on mountain | Glory of His kingdom revealed |
| Temptation on mountain | Devil shows "all the kingdoms of the world" FROM a mountain |
| Return to Mount of Olives | Zech 14:4 — establishing His kingdom |

Mountains are consistently connected to AUTHORITY and KINGDOM.

### 7. The Substitution Test

| Verse | Substitution |
|-------|--------------|
| "The seven heads are seven mountains" | "The seven heads are seven [kingdoms]" ✓✓ |
| "The stone became a great mountain and filled the whole earth" | "The stone became a great [kingdom] and filled the whole earth" ✓✓ |
| "O destroying mountain, which destroyest all the earth" | "O destroying [kingdom], which destroyest all the earth" ✓✓ |
| "The mountain of the LORD's house shall be established" | "The [government] of the LORD's house shall be established" ✓✓ |
| "Say unto this mountain, Be thou removed" | "Say unto this [ruling power], Be thou removed" ✓ |
| "Let us go up to the mountain of the LORD" | "Let us go up to the [kingdom/authority] of the LORD" ✓ |

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Revelation 17:9** — "The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth."

   This is explicit symbolic interpretation within Scripture itself. Mountains = kingdoms/powers.

2. **Daniel 2:35,44-45** — "The stone...became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth... the God of heaven shall set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed."

   The stone (Christ's kingdom) grows into a mountain that fills the earth. Mountain = the visible, established dominion of that kingdom.

3. **Isaiah 2:2-3** — "The mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it... for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem."

   God's mountain is His governmental authority—exalted above other powers, source of law, destination of nations seeking His rule.

4. **Jeremiah 51:25** — "Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth."

   Babylon (a world empire) is called a "mountain"—a destructive ruling power.

5. **Matthew 21:21** — "If ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."

   Faith can topple governmental powers/obstacles that stand in the way of God's purposes.

## Dual Application

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **God's Mountain** | Zion — God's kingdom, His righteous government |
| **World's Mountains** | Babylon, the seven mountains of Revelation — worldly kingdoms |

The symbol works for both divine and human/worldly governments. Mountains are seats of power—whether God's throne or earthly empires.

---

## Conclusion

MOUNTAIN symbolizes **kingdom or ruling authority**—an established, elevated seat of governmental power. This meaning:

- Is explicitly stated in Rev 17:9 ("heads ARE mountains")
- Explains why the stone BECOMES a mountain in Daniel 2
- Explains why Babylon is called a "mountain"
- Explains why law goes forth FROM mountains
- Explains why faith can "remove" mountains (topple powers)
- Works for both God's kingdom and worldly kingdoms
