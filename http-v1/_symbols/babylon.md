# BABYLON — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Kingdom |
| **Two Words** | Worldly Kingdom |
| **Sentence** | The worldly kingdom system built on human authority and effort—man's substitute for God's covenant, using brick (man-made) instead of stone (God-given), the "mother of harlots" because all idolatry flows from rejecting God's Kingdom for man's |

**Opposite**: Jerusalem/Zion ([Heavenly Kingdom](/symbols/mountain/))

## The Key Insight: Brick vs. Stone

### Genesis 11:3
> "And they said one to another, Go to, let us make **brick**, and burn them throughly. And they had **brick** for **stone**, and slime had they for morter."

| Material | Symbolic Meaning | Source |
|----------|------------------|--------|
| **STONE** | Covenant | God-given, natural, enduring |
| **BRICK** | Man-made substitute | Human effort, manufactured |

**BABYLON uses man-made substitutes for what only God can provide.**

The builders of Babel used BRICK (man-made) instead of STONE (God-given covenant). This is the essence of Babylon: **human effort replacing divine provision**.

---

## Genesis 11:4 — Making Their Own Covenant

> "And they said, Go to, let us build us a **city** and a **tower**, whose top may reach unto **heaven**; and let us make us a **NAME**, lest we be scattered"

| Element | Worldly Kingdom (Babylon) | Heavenly Kingdom (God's) |
|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **CITY** | Man-built covenant community | God-established Jerusalem |
| **TOWER** | Human effort reaching to heaven | God descending to man |
| **NAME** | Self-made covenant | God's NAME/Covenant given |
| **HEAVEN** | Man ascending by works | God's dwelling, His gift |

**"Let us make us a NAME"** = Let us establish our own covenant, our own authority, our own kingdom.

This directly contrasts with God **giving** His NAME (covenant) to His people.

## Worldly Kingdom vs. Heavenly Kingdom

| Worldly Kingdom (Babylon) | Heavenly Kingdom (Jerusalem/Zion) |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Man's authority | God's authority |
| Human effort (brick) | Divine provision (stone) |
| Self-made covenant (our name) | God's covenant (His NAME) |
| Man reaching up to heaven | God coming down to man |
| Works salvation | Grace through covenant |
| "I am, and none else" (Isa 47:8) | "I AM that I AM" (true God) |
| Temporary, falls | Eternal, endures |

## Isaiah 47:8,10 — Babylon Claims to Be God

> "thou that sayest in thine heart, **I am, and none else beside me**"
> "Thy **wisdom** and thy **knowledge**, it hath **perverted** thee"

Babylon claims divine authority: "I am, and none else beside me" — the language of deity.

This is the essence of the worldly kingdom: **man claiming God's place**.

---

## Daniel 4:30 — Human Glory

> "The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that **I** have built for the house of the kingdom **by the might of MY power**, and for the honour of **MY majesty**?"

Note the I/MY/MY:
- **I** have built
- **MY** power
- **MY** majesty

This is worldly kingdom thinking: human achievement, human glory, human authority.

**God's response** (v.31-32): The kingdom was taken from Nebuchadnezzar until he acknowledged "that the most High **ruleth in the kingdom of men**."

---

## Revelation 17:5 — Mother of Harlots

> "upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, **BABYLON THE GREAT**, THE **MOTHER OF HARLOTS** AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH"

| Title | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **MOTHER** | Source, origin |
| **OF HARLOTS** | Of idolaters/covenant-breakers |

**All idolatry flows from choosing man's kingdom over God's.**

When you reject the Heavenly Kingdom (God's covenant, God's authority), you enter the Worldly Kingdom — and from there flows all false worship.

---

## Revelation 17:9,18 — Sits on Mountains

> "The seven heads are **seven mountains**, on which the woman sitteth"
> "the woman which thou sawest is that great **city**, which **reigneth over the kings of the earth**"

| Symbol | Meaning | Babylon's Claim |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **MOUNTAIN** | Kingdom | Babylon sits on/claims all kingdoms |
| **CITY** | Covenant community | Babylon is the worldly covenant community |
| **REIGNS** | Authority | Claims authority over all earthly kings |

---

## Why "Kingdom" Not "Confusion"

The old definition focused on the etymology: Babel = "confound" (H1101, balal).

But "confusion" is a **result**, not the **essence**.

| Level | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| **Etymology** | The word means "confound/mix" |
| **Result** | Confusion follows from rejecting God's order |
| **ESSENCE** | Worldly Kingdom — man's authority replacing God's |

The confusion at Babel was **God's judgment** on the worldly kingdom, not the definition of what Babylon IS.

**Babylon IS the Worldly Kingdom. Confusion is what happens when man rejects God's rule.**

## The Production Chain

| Stage | Worldly Kingdom | Heavenly Kingdom |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Foundation** | Brick (man-made) | Stone (God-given covenant) |
| **Authority** | Man's name | God's NAME |
| **Method** | Human effort | Divine grace |
| **Result** | Produces harlots (idolaters) | Produces faithful bride |
| **Destiny** | Falls, destroyed | Endures forever |

## "Come Out of Her, My People" (Revelation 18:4)

> "**Come out of her**, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues"

The call to God's people: **Leave the Worldly Kingdom. Enter the Heavenly Kingdom.**

This is the same call throughout Scripture:
- Abraham: Leave Ur (Chaldea/Babylon)
- Israel: Leave Egypt (another worldly kingdom)
- Church: Come out of Babylon

## Summary

**BABYLON = WORLDLY KINGDOM**

The worldly kingdom is characterized by:
1. **Human authority** replacing God's ("I am, and none else")
2. **Human effort** replacing divine provision (brick for stone)
3. **Self-made covenant** replacing God's covenant (make us a name)
4. **Works salvation** — man reaching up to heaven
5. **Source of all idolatry** — mother of harlots

The opposite is **JERUSALEM/ZION = HEAVENLY KINGDOM**:
- God's authority
- God's covenant (stone)
- God's NAME given
- Grace — God reaching down to man
- Produces faithful bride
