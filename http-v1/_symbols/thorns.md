# BRIARS AND THORNS — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Worldly |
| **Two Words** | Choking People |

## The Argument

### 1. The Parable Principle

The Parable of the Sower provides an **explicit definition** of what thorns represent:

> **Matthew 13:7** — "And some fell among **thorns**; and the thorns sprung up, and **choked** them"
>
> **Matthew 13:22** — "He also that received seed among the **thorns** is he that heareth the word; and the **care of this world**, and the **deceitfulness of riches**, **choke** the word, and he becometh unfruitful."

> **Luke 8:14** — "And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are **choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life**, and bring no fruit to perfection."

**Jesus explicitly defines THORNS as:**
- Care of this world
- Deceitfulness of riches
- Pleasures of this life

### 2. Connection to TREE = Nation/People

We have established that:
- **TREE** = Nation / People Group

Thorns and briers are **types of plants/trees**. Therefore:
- **THORNS** = A TYPE of people/nation

What TYPE? The parable tells us: people characterized by **worldly cares, riches, and pleasures**.

### 3. What Thorns DO

The key action of thorns is **CHOKING**:

| Verse | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Matthew 13:7 | "thorns... **choked** them" |
| Matthew 13:22 | "**choke** the word, and he becometh unfruitful" |
| Mark 4:7 | "thorns... **choked** it, and it yielded no fruit" |
| Luke 8:7 | "thorns sprang up with it, and **choked** it" |
| Luke 8:14 | "**choked** with cares and riches and pleasures" |

Thorns don't just exist — they **actively prevent fruitfulness** in others.

### 4. Two Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **IS** | A type of people/nation (worldly, materialistic) |
| **DOES** | Chokes — prevents others from bearing fruit |

## The Parable Test

In the Parable of the Sower, substitute our symbol meanings:

| Symbol | Meaning | Substitution |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| SEED | Word | ✓ Explicit |
| GROUND | Heart | ✓ (Luke 8:15 — "honest and good heart") |
| THORNS | Worldly people | ✓ Those characterized by worldly cares |
| FRUIT | Results/Works | ✓ What the word produces |

**The parable makes sense**: The word falls among worldly people, and their cares/riches/pleasures choke out the word's effectiveness, preventing fruitfulness.

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Matthew 13:22** — "the **care of this world**, and the **deceitfulness of riches**, **choke** the word"
   
   This is the explicit definition from Jesus Himself.

2. **Luke 8:14** — "choked with **cares** and **riches** and **pleasures** of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection"
   
   Expands the definition: cares, riches, AND pleasures.

3. **Ezekiel 28:24** — "there shall be no more a **pricking brier** unto the house of Israel, nor any **grieving thorn** of all that are round about them, that despised them"
   
   Thorns = Those who **despise** and **afflict** God's people.

4. **Genesis 3:18** — "**Thorns** also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee"
   
   Part of the curse — but the Parable of the Sower reveals what they symbolize.

## Relationship to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Connection |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **TREE** | Nation/People | Thorns are a TYPE of tree/plant |
| **SEED** | Word | Thorns CHOKE the seed |
| **FRUIT** | Works/Results | Thorns PREVENT fruit |
| **GROUND** | Heart | Thorny ground = heart consumed by world |

---

## Conclusion

**THORNS** represent **worldly people** — those characterized by:
- Care of this world
- Deceitfulness of riches
- Pleasures of this life

Their defining action is **CHOKING** — they prevent fruitfulness in others (and themselves). Since TREE = Nation/People, THORNS (a type of plant) = A type of people characterized by worldliness.

The Parable of the Sower is the key that unlocks this symbol, as Jesus explicitly defines what thorns represent.
