# EAGLE — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Messenger |
| **Two Words** | Angel / Agent |
| **Sentence** | A messenger or agent sent under covenant authority—angels have wings, cherubim have eagle faces, and empires act as God's messengers of judgment |

**Opposite**: Unsent / Unauthorized

## The Key Connection: Eagles and Angels Both Have WINGS

The most obvious clue hiding in plain sight:
- **Angels** have **WINGS**
- **Eagles** have **WINGS**
- **Cherubim** have the face of an **EAGLE** (Ezekiel 1:10, 10:14, Revelation 4:7)

Since WINGS = Covenant Covering, an EAGLE is the entity that **possesses** those wings and operates under that covenant authority. This is exactly what a **MESSENGER/ANGEL** does.

## The Cherubim — Eagle-Faced Angels

> **Ezekiel 1:10** — "As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an **eagle**."

> **Revelation 4:7** — "And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying **eagle**."

The cherubim (highest order of angels) have **eagle faces**. The eagle represents one aspect of angelic nature—the swift messenger who bears God's will.

## Exodus: Eagles' Wings and the Angel

Two key verses in the same context:

> **Exodus 19:4** — "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on **eagles' wings**, and brought you unto myself."

> **Exodus 23:20-21** — "Behold, I send an **angel** before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared... **my name is in him**."

God bore Israel on "eagles' wings" AND sent an "angel" before them. The EAGLE and the ANGEL/MESSENGER are connected—both carry Israel under God's covenant authority.

## The Parable of the Two Eagles (Ezekiel 17)

Scripture explicitly identifies the eagles:

| Symbol | Identity (v.12, 15) |
|--------|---------------------|
| **First Great Eagle** (v.3) | King of **Babylon** |
| **Second Great Eagle** (v.7) | **Egypt** |

These empires are "eagles" because they act as **MESSENGERS/AGENTS** of God's purposes. Babylon was sent by God to execute judgment on Jerusalem. Even pagan empires function as God's messengers when He sends them.

> **Jeremiah 25:9** — "I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, **my servant**"

Nebuchadnezzar as God's "servant" = messenger/agent = eagle.

## Pattern: Eagles as Instruments of Judgment

| Verse | Text | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **Hosea 8:1** | "He shall come as an **eagle** against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant" | Messenger of covenant judgment |
| **Deuteronomy 28:49** | "The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far... as swift as the **eagle** flieth" | Nation sent as messenger of judgment |
| **Jeremiah 48:40** | "He shall fly as an **eagle**, and shall spread his wings over Moab" | Agent spreading dominion |
| **Habakkuk 1:8** | "They shall fly as the **eagle** that hasteth to eat" | Chaldeans as swift messengers |

The consistent pattern: eagles come **swiftly** as **agents/messengers** of judgment, sent by higher authority.

## Eagles Gathered at the Carcass

> **Matthew 24:28** — "For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the **eagles** be gathered together."

> **Luke 17:37** — "Wheresoever the body is, thither will the **eagles** be gathered together."

Messengers/agents gather where judgment falls. The "eagles" are the instruments of divine judgment assembling at the appointed place.

---

## Deuteronomy 32:11 — The Eagle Bears Its Young

> "As an **eagle** stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, **taketh them, beareth them** on her wings"

The eagle:
1. **Stirs up** — prompts action
2. **Flutters over** — protects
3. **Spreads wings** — extends covenant covering
4. **Takes and bears** — carries under authority

This is exactly what a messenger does on behalf of the sender—takes, carries, delivers under the authority (wings) of the one who sent them.

---

## Revelation 12:14 — Eagle Wings for Deliverance

> "And to the woman were given two **wings** of a great **eagle**, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished... from the face of the serpent."

The woman (faithful community) receives "eagle wings"—messenger-like deliverance under covenant authority—to escape the serpent. This parallels Exodus 19:4 where God bore Israel on eagles' wings out of Egypt (the serpent/dragon).

## Two Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **IS** | Messenger — an agent sent under authority |
| **DOES** | Bears/Carries — delivers on behalf of the sender |

---

## Relationship to WINGS

| Symbol | Meaning | Role |
|--------|---------|------|
| **WINGS** | Covenant Covering | The authority/covering under which one operates |
| **EAGLE** | Messenger | The entity that possesses and uses those wings |

An eagle HAS wings → A messenger operates UNDER covenant authority.

The wings give the eagle its power to bear and carry. The covenant gives the messenger authority to act.

## Why I Initially Missed This

The cherubim-eagle connection was obvious in hindsight:
- Cherubim = angels = messengers
- Cherubim have eagle faces
- Both angels and eagles have wings

The question "What entity in Scripture is most associated with wings?" should have immediately pointed to **ANGELS/MESSENGERS**.

---

## Conclusion

**EAGLE** = **MESSENGER / ANGEL**

- The eagle-faced cherubim reveal the connection
- Eagles have WINGS (covenant authority)
- Empires act as "eagles" when sent as God's agents
- The eagle bears/carries under the authority of the sender

To be "borne on eagles' wings" is to be carried by God's messenger(s) under His covenant authority.
