# FORNICATION — Symbolic Word Study

## Final Meaning

| Form | Symbolic Meaning |
|------|------------------|
| **One Word** | Idolatry |
| **Two Words** | Serving Idols |
| **Sentence** | The act of giving devotion, service, or allegiance to anyone or anything other than the true God — breaking the first commandment by having other gods/masters |

**Opposite**: Faithfulness / Exclusive devotion to God

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Marriage Metaphor

Throughout Scripture, God's relationship with His people is portrayed as a marriage covenant:
- God = Husband
- Israel/Church = Wife
- Covenant = Marriage vows

In this metaphor:
- **Faithfulness** = Exclusive devotion to God
- **Fornication/Adultery/Whoredom** = Pursuing other gods/masters

---

### 2. The Explicit Pattern: "Go a Whoring AFTER Other Gods"

The consistent biblical pattern connects whoredom/fornication with idolatry:

| Verse | The Pattern |
|-------|-------------|
| Exodus 34:15-16 | "go a whoring **after their gods**" |
| Leviticus 20:5-6 | "go a whoring after... Molech" / "after wizards" |
| Deuteronomy 31:16 | "go a whoring **after the gods** of the strangers" |
| Judges 2:17 | "went a whoring **after other gods**" |
| Judges 8:33 | "went a whoring **after Baalim**" |
| 1 Chronicles 5:25 | "went a whoring **after the gods** of the people" |
| Ezekiel 6:9 | "go a whoring **after their idols**" |
| Hosea 4:12 | "gone a whoring **from under their God**" |
| Hosea 9:1 | "gone a whoring **from thy God**" |

The pattern is always: **whoring AFTER other gods** or **whoring FROM the true God**.

---

### 3. The Critical Verse: Deuteronomy 31:16

> "this people will rise up, and **go a whoring** after the gods of the strangers... and will **forsake me**, and **break my covenant** which I have made with them"

This verse explicitly equates:
- "Go a whoring" = "Break my covenant"

Fornication is not merely sexual immorality in the physical sense — it is **COVENANT BREAKING** through **IDOLATRY**.

---

### 4. Hosea: The Extended Metaphor

The entire book of Hosea develops this metaphor:

> "Go, take unto thee a wife of **whoredoms** and children of **whoredoms**: for the land hath committed great **whoredom**, **departing from the LORD**" (Hosea 1:2)

"Whoredom" = "Departing from the LORD" — pursuing other gods.

> "thou hast gone a whoring **from thy God**" (Hosea 9:1)

---

### 5. Ezekiel 16 and 23: Israel's Spiritual Fornication

These chapters describe Israel's history as that of an unfaithful wife:

> "Thou hast also committed **fornication** with the Egyptians... and hast increased thy **whoredoms**" (Ezekiel 16:26)

> "their whorish heart, which hath **departed from me**, and with their eyes, which **go a whoring after their idols**" (Ezekiel 6:9)

The "fornication" is not literal — it is **spiritual unfaithfulness** through **idolatry**.

---

### 6. Revelation: Babylon the Whore

> "the great **whore** that sitteth upon many waters: With whom the **kings of the earth have committed fornication**" (Revelation 17:1-2)

> "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE **MOTHER OF HARLOTS** AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH" (Revelation 17:5)

> "all nations have drunk of the wine of... her **fornication**, and the kings of the earth have **committed fornication** with her" (Revelation 18:3)

Babylon represents a false religious/political system that leads nations into **spiritual fornication** — idolatry on a global scale.

---

### 7. Hebrew Word: זָנָה (zanah) — H2181

The Hebrew word for "commit fornication/whoredom" is **zanah** (H2181).

Its uses confirm the spiritual meaning:
- Physical harlotry
- **Spiritual unfaithfulness to God** (the dominant prophetic usage)
- Pursuing foreign alliances instead of trusting God

---

### 8. Connection to the First Commandment

> "Thou shalt have **no other gods** before me" (Exodus 20:3)

Fornication is the violation of the **first commandment** — having other gods/masters.

In Hebrew, "baal" (בעל) means both "husband" AND "lord/master" — showing the connection between the marriage metaphor and the question of lordship/authority.

---

## Recursive Definition

FORNICATION does not stop at "idolatry" — we must ask: **What is idolatry?**

See: [`IDOLATRY.md`](IDOLATRY.md)

**FORNICATION → IDOLATRY → Self-rule (Rejecting God's Word)**

---

## Relationship to Symbol Table

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | The standard to follow |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | Following God's standard |
| **FORNICATION** | Idolatry | Turning from God to other masters |
| **IDOLATRY** | Self-rule | Rejecting God's word for another standard |

FORNICATION is the **action/act** of committing idolatry — turning from God to serve other masters.

---

## Substitution Stress Test

| Verse | With "Idolatry / Serving Other Masters" |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Deut 31:16 "go a whoring after other gods" | "commit idolatry by following other gods" ✓ |
| Hosea 1:2 "the land hath committed great whoredom" | "the land has greatly committed idolatry" ✓ |
| Rev 17:2 "kings have committed fornication" with Babylon | "kings have committed idolatry" with false system ✓ |
| Ezek 6:9 "go a whoring after their idols" | "commit idolatry after their idols" ✓ (explicit!) |
| Acts 15:20 "abstain from fornication" | "abstain from idolatry" ✓ (paired with "pollutions of idols"!) |

## The Redundancy Test: Why Fornication CANNOT Mean Sexual Sin

**Critical Logical Proof:**

Under Torah, the penalty for sexual adultery is **DEATH**:

> "the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be **put to death**" — Leviticus 20:10

> "If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall **both of them die**" — Deuteronomy 22:22

**The Logical Conclusion:**

If sexual adultery = death penalty, then:
1. You don't NEED a divorce provision for it
2. The marriage ends by **execution**, not paperwork
3. Therefore Jesus' "except for fornication" (Matthew 5:32, 19:9) **cannot mean sexual sin**

This is the **Redundancy Test**: If a proposed meaning creates legal redundancy with an existing law, the meaning must be wrong.

---

## Practical Application: Grounds for Divorce

Since FORNICATION = Idolatry (not sexual sin), Jesus is teaching:

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Spouse commits sexual adultery | Death penalty under Torah (marriage ends) |
| Spouse commits fornication (idolatry) | Divorce **permitted** (Matthew 5:32, 19:9) |
| Unequally yoked to an idolater | Divorce **commanded** (Ezra 10:3) |

**Ezra 10:3** — "let us make a covenant with our God to **put away all the wives**"

Ezra didn't permit divorce from idolatrous wives — he **commanded** it. Remaining yoked to an idolater is itself covenant violation.

**2 Corinthians 6:14** — "Be ye not **unequally yoked** together with unbelievers"

## Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to FORNICATION |
|--------|---------|----------------------------|
| **[MARRIAGE](/symbols/marriage/)** | Covenant | Fornication = breaking the marriage covenant |
| **[HARLOT](/symbols/harlot/)** | Idolater | One who commits fornication |
| **[VIRGIN](/symbols/virgin/)** | Covenant Faithful | Opposite of harlot |
| **[BABYLON](/symbols/babylon/)** | Worldly Kingdom | "Kings committed fornication with her" |
| **[IDOLATRY](/symbols/idolatry/)** | Serving Other Gods | Fornication IS idolatry |

---

## Summary

**FORNICATION** in Scripture (especially prophetically) means **IDOLATRY** — the act of giving devotion, service, or allegiance to anyone or anything other than the true God.

The marriage metaphor (God as husband, Israel as wife) makes spiritual unfaithfulness = adultery/fornication.

The constant pattern "go a whoring AFTER other gods" confirms that fornication = serving other masters = breaking the first commandment.

The Redundancy Test proves this isn't about sexual sin — that already has its own penalty (death). Fornication as grounds for divorce must mean something else: **idolatry/covenant unfaithfulness to God**.
