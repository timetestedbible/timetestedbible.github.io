# OIL — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Works |
| **Two Words** | Proven Works |
| **Sentence** | Works that have been tested and proven through trials—as oil is produced by pressing/crushing olives (fruit of the covenant tree), so proven works result from tested faithfulness |

**Opposite**: Untested / Unproven

---

## The Key Insight: Trace the Origin

**How is oil made?**
1. **OLIVES** (fruit) are gathered from **OLIVE TREES**
2. Olives are **PRESSED/CRUSHED**
3. **OIL** is extracted through pressure

**Connecting to known symbols:**
- TREE = Nation / Covenant Community
- OLIVE TREE = Israel (Romans 11)
- FRUIT = Works
- OLIVES = Works of the covenant community
- PRESSING = Trials / Testing
- OIL = **Works that have been tested and proven**

## Why OIL ≠ Holy Spirit (The Mainstream Error)

Mainstream teaching says OIL = Holy Spirit. But this creates a fatal contradiction:

**Matthew 25:9** — "go ye rather to them that sell, and **buy** for yourselves"

**Acts 8:20** — "Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the **gift of God may be purchased** with money"

The Holy Spirit is a **gift** — it **cannot be bought**. But the foolish virgins are told to "go buy" oil.

Therefore OIL ≠ Spirit.

**What CAN be "bought" (acquired through effort)?**
- Proven works
- Tested faithfulness
- Track record of obedience

## The Parable of the Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13)

| Virgin Type | Had Oil? | Meaning |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Wise** | Yes — in vessels | Had reserves of proven works |
| **Foolish** | No reserves | Had not built up tested faithfulness |

The wise virgins had **prepared** — they had done the work, gone through the "pressing," built up reserves of proven obedience.

The foolish virgins could not **borrow** the wise virgins' oil because you cannot borrow someone else's track record of faithfulness. You must acquire your own.

## Gethsemane = "Oil Press"

Jesus prayed in the Garden of **Gethsemane** (גַּת שְׁמָנִים) — which literally means **"Oil Press"**.

This is where Jesus was "pressed" before His crucifixion — the ultimate test of faithful obedience.

> **Luke 22:44** — "And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground."

The pressing produced the ultimate proven work.

## Oil Fuels the Light

We defined **LIGHT** = Torah / God's Standard.

**Exodus 27:20** — "pure oil olive beaten for the **light**, to cause the **lamp** to burn always"

**What fuels ongoing witness to Torah?** Proven works. Tested faithfulness.

A lamp without oil goes out — a witness without proven works loses credibility.

---

## Anointing for Service

Oil was used to anoint:
- **Priests** (Exodus 29:7)
- **Kings** (1 Samuel 16:13)
- **Prophets** (1 Kings 19:16)

What qualifies someone for service? **Proven faithfulness**. Tested works.

> **1 Timothy 3:10** — "let these also first be **proved**; then let them use the office"

The anointing signifies that someone has been "pressed" and proven worthy of service.

---

## Connection to 1 Samuel 16:13

> "Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him... and the **Spirit** of the LORD came upon David"

The oil (proven works/qualification) came first; then the Spirit came upon him. The oil didn't **equal** the Spirit — it **preceded** and qualified for the Spirit's empowerment.

David had already proven himself faithful as a shepherd (killing lion and bear) before being anointed king.

## The Production Chain

| Stage | Physical | Symbolic |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Source** | Olive Tree | Covenant Community (Israel) |
| **Fruit** | Olives | Works |
| **Process** | Pressing/Crushing | Trials/Testing |
| **Product** | Oil | Proven Works |
| **Use** | Fuels lamp, Anoints | Enables witness, Qualifies for service |

---

## Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to OIL |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **[TREE](/symbols/tree/)** | Nation | Olive tree = source of olives |
| **[FRUIT](/symbols/fruit/)** | Works | Olives = raw works before testing |
| **OIL** | Proven Works | Works after pressing/testing |
| **[LIGHT](/symbols/light/)** | Example | Oil fuels the light (proven works produce visible example) |

---

## Why Mainstream Got This Wrong

Mainstream teaching connected oil to Spirit because:
1. Anointing passages show Spirit coming after oil is applied
2. They failed to trace the **production chain** (how is oil made?)
3. They didn't test against **paradoxes** (can you buy the Spirit?)

Without systematic methodology, surface-level connections lead to wrong conclusions.

## Summary

**OIL** = **PROVEN WORKS** — works that have been tested through trials.

- Oil comes from **pressing olives** (testing works)
- You can "buy" oil (acquire proven works through effort/endurance)
- You cannot borrow someone else's oil (track record)
- Oil fuels the lamp (proven works enable ongoing witness)
- Anointing with oil qualifies for service (proven faithfulness)

The wise virgins had reserves of proven works. The foolish did not.
