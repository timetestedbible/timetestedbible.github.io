## Evidence: Explicit Metaphors

### Isaiah 5:7 — VINEYARD = ISRAEL
> "For the **vineyard** of the LORD of hosts **IS the house of ISRAEL**, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant"

**EXPLICIT DEFINITION**: The vineyard/plant = **ISRAEL** (the nation)

### Daniel 4:20-22 — TREE = KINGDOM
> "The **tree** that thou sawest... **It is THOU, O king**, that art grown and become strong"

The great tree = NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S KINGDOM (Babylon)

### Ezekiel 31:3,6,18 — TREES = NATIONS
> "the **Assyrian** was a **cedar** in Lebanon" (v.3)
> "under his **shadow** dwelt all great **nations**" (v.6)
> "This is **Pharaoh** and all his **multitude**" (v.18)

**EXPLICIT**: The cedar tree = ASSYRIA, EGYPT — great nations

### Romans 11:17-24 — OLIVE TREE = ISRAEL
> "if some of the **branches** be broken off, and thou, being a **wild olive tree**, wert graffed in among them"

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Olive Tree** | Israel — the covenant community |
| **Root** | The patriarchs/covenant foundation |
| **Natural Branches** | Jewish people (can be broken off) |
| **Wild Branches** | Gentiles (can be grafted in) |

## Dimension 1: WHAT Tree IS

| Evidence | Tree = |
|----------|--------|
| Isaiah 5:7 | House of Israel (nation) |
| Daniel 4:22 | Babylon (great kingdom) |
| Ezekiel 31 | Assyria / Egypt (nations) |

**TREE = NATION / PEOPLE GROUP**

- Foreign nations (Babylon, Assyria, Egypt)
- Great empires or small communities

## Dimension 2: WHAT Tree DOES

### Bears Fruit
> "**ISRAEL** is an empty **vine**, he bringeth forth **fruit** unto himself" (Hosea 10:1)

Nations produce FRUIT — works, results, the output of their character.

### Provides Shelter/Shadow
> "under his **shadow** dwelt all great **nations**" (Ezekiel 31:6)
> "the beasts of the field had **shadow** under it" (Daniel 4:12)

Nations can provide PROTECTION and COVERING for those within their borders.

### Can Be Cut Down (Judged)
> "Hew the **tree** down, and destroy it" (Daniel 4:23)
> "every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is **hewn down**, and **cast into the fire**" (Matthew 7:19)

Nations face JUDGMENT — they can be cut down based on their fruit.

## Conclusion

TREE has **two dimensions**:

1. **WHAT IT IS**: Nation / People Group — can be God's nation or foreign nations, great empires or small communities

2. **WHAT IT DOES**: Bears Fruit / Shelters — produces results based on its character, can provide protection for those within

The tree symbol is flexible — the SIZE and TYPE of tree indicates the scale and character of the nation. What matters most is the FRUIT it produces.
