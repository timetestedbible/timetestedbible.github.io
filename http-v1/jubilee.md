# Jubilee and Sabbath Year Cycles

The Jubilee and Sabbath year cycles are foundational to the biblical calendar system. These cycles govern land rest, debt release, and the proclamation of liberty throughout the land.

## The Sabbath Year (Year of Release)

Every seventh year is a **Sabbath Year**, also called the **Year of Release**. During this year:

- The land rests from agricultural work (Leviticus 25:1-7)
- Debts among the people are forgiven (Deuteronomy 15:1-3)
- The Torah is read publicly at the Feast of Tabernacles (Deuteronomy 31:10-13)

> **Deuteronomy 15:1-2** — "At the end of every seven years you must cancel debts. This is the manner of remission: Every creditor shall cancel what he has loaned to his neighbor. He is not to collect anything from his neighbor or brother, because YHWH's time of release has been proclaimed."

The planting prohibition begins in the **fall of the 6th year** and continues through the **fall of the 7th year**.

## The Jubilee Year

The **Jubilee** occurs every 50th year and is proclaimed on the **Day of Atonement** of the 49th year. The 50th year is simultaneously the first year of the next cycle.

> **Leviticus 25:8-10** — "Count off seven sabbaths of years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbaths of years amount to forty-nine years. Then sound the trumpet on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land. Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants."

During the Jubilee:
- All land returns to its original family ownership
- Hebrew servants are freed
- Liberty is proclaimed throughout the land
- The planting prohibition extends through the fall of the 50th year

## The Counting System

Events in the biblical calendar can be dated using a hierarchical notation:

**Jubilee X, Week Y, Year Z**

- **Jubilee**: The nth jubilee period since Adam
- **Week**: The xth week of years within that jubilee (1-7)
- **Year**: The yth year within that week (1-7)

### Reference Point: The Jordan Crossing

The cycle is anchored to the **Jordan River crossing in Spring 1406 BC**, when Israel entered the Promised Land under Joshua. This was:

- **Year 1** of a new cycle
- The **Jubilee year of the 50th Jubilee** since Adam
- Therefore: **Jubilee 51, Week 1, Year 1**

This means the first Jubilee since Adam occurred approximately 2450 years before the Jordan crossing (50 jubilees × 49 years = 2450 years), placing Adam's creation around 3856 BC.

## Cycle Mathematics

The cycle works as follows:

| Years in Cycle | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Year 1 | First year of jubilee cycle (also Jubilee year / Year 50 of previous) |
| Year 7 | First Sabbath year |
| Year 14 | Second Sabbath year |
| Year 21 | Third Sabbath year |
| Year 28 | Fourth Sabbath year |
| Year 35 | Fifth Sabbath year |
| Year 42 | Sixth Sabbath year |
| Year 49 | Seventh Sabbath year |
| Year 50 | Jubilee (= Year 1 of next cycle) |

The **49th year** is both a Sabbath year AND the year before the Jubilee. During this year, the planting prohibition continues through the Jubilee, providing rest for the land for a full two years.

## Historical Confirmation

Several historical markers confirm this cycle:

### Josephus and 35 BC
Josephus documents a sabbatical year in 35 BC, which aligns with the cycle counting from the Jordan crossing.

### Yeshua's Proclamation (29 AD)
In **Luke 4:18-19**, Yeshua read from Isaiah 61 in the synagogue at Nazareth and declared:

> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim **the year of the Lord's favor**."

This proclamation occurred at the **Day of Atonement in 29 AD**, which was a **Year of Release** (sabbatical year) according to the cycle. Yeshua could only lawfully make this proclamation during an actual sabbatical year.

From 1406 BC to 29 AD:
- Years elapsed: 1405 + 29 = 1434 years
- 1434 ÷ 7 = 204 full weeks + 6 years
- 29 AD is the 7th year (Sabbath year) ✓
