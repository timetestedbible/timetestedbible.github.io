# About Lunar Sabbath

## The Book

Lunar Sabbath is an evidence-based exploration of the biblical calendar system. It examines:

- **When does the day start?** - Dawn or sunset?
- **When does the month start?** - Full moon, crescent, or conjunction?
- **When does the year start?** - How to determine the first month
- **When is the Sabbath?** - Lunar weeks vs. continuous seven-day cycle

The book presents multiple independent lines of evidence that converge on the same conclusions, creating a robust case that can be tested against history, astronomy, and Scripture.

## The Website

- **Explore the Evidence** - Each fact is linked to its supporting evidence and the chapters where it's discussed
- **See the Connections** - The [Fact Explorer](/explorer/) visualizes how all the evidence fits together
- **Trace Dependencies** - See what each fact depends on, and what depends on it
- **Evaluate Confidence** - Each fact is rated for confidence level based on the strength of evidence
