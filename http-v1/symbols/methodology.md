How do we discover what biblical symbols *actually* mean? This page explains the methodology used to derive the symbolic meanings in our [Symbol Dictionary](/symbols/).

---

## Foundational Assumptions

### Scripture is Intentionally Designed

<div class="method-section">
The Bible's symbolic system is **designed to preserve meaning** across time and translation:

- **Resists language drift** — meanings survive even as languages evolve
- **Survives translation** — symbolic relationships transfer into any language (given literal, consistent translation)
- **Distributed truth** — "here a little, there a little, precept upon precept" (Isaiah 28:10)

<strong>Principle:</strong> If your interpretation depends on a quirk of one translation or one verse, it's likely wrong. True patterns appear **consistently** across Scripture.
</div>

### Watch for Translation Variations

A single Hebrew or Greek word may be translated into **multiple different English words**, obscuring the underlying pattern.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example:</strong> Hebrew שָׁלוֹם (shalom, H7965) is translated as:
- "peace" (most common)
- "prosperity"  
- "welfare"
- "safe"

Searching only for "peace" misses verses where the SAME concept appears!
</div>

**Solution**: Use a concordance with Strong's numbers to find ALL occurrences of the original word, regardless of how it was translated into English.

---

## The Core Principle

<div class="method-section">
<strong>Let Scripture Interpret Scripture</strong>

We don't impose meanings onto biblical symbols from outside sources. Instead, we systematically examine how the Bible *itself* defines, uses, and applies each term. The symbolic meaning emerges from Scripture's own testimony.
</div>

---

## CRITICAL: The Executable Workflow

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>Warning:</strong> This is not a document to "keep in mind." It is a <strong>step-by-step process to execute</strong>. Skipping steps leads to wrong conclusions. "Mental math" — keeping things in your head instead of showing work — causes failure.

<em>"Lean not on your own understanding"</em> applies to the analysis process itself.
</div>

### Phase 1: Generate Multiple Candidates (NEVER STOP AT ONE)

You MUST generate at least 3 candidate meanings before evaluating. **Assume your first conclusion is wrong.**

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1.1 | Generate **Candidate #1** (first intuition) — write it down |
| 1.2 | **REJECT CHECK**: Is this a dictionary definition or synonym? If YES → discard |
| 1.3 | **Assume #1 is WRONG** → Generate **Candidate #2** (meaningfully different) |
| 1.4 | **REJECT CHECK**: Dictionary/synonym? If YES → discard |
| 1.5 | **Assume #2 is WRONG** → Generate **Candidate #3** (meaningfully different) |
| 1.6 | **REJECT CHECK**: Dictionary/synonym? If YES → discard |

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Rejection Examples:</strong>

| Symbol | REJECT (Dictionary) | CONSIDER (Symbolic) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| WATER | Liquid, H2O, fluid | People/Masses |
| LIGHT | Brightness, illumination | Example |
| TREE | Plant, wood, timber | Nation |
| OIL | Grease, lubricant | Proven Works |

<strong>Test:</strong> Would a secular reader using only a dictionary arrive at this meaning? If YES → not the symbolic meaning.
</div>

### Phase 2: Test Each Candidate Systematically

For **EACH** candidate, execute this checklist. **Show your work** — write out each step.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2.1 | **LOOK UP** all related symbols from the Symbol Dictionary — write out IS/IS2/DOES |
| 2.2 | **IDENTIFY** all other known symbols in Context A |
| 2.3 | **SUBSTITUTE ALL** known symbols + candidate into Context A |
| 2.4 | **IDENTIFY** all other known symbols in Context B |
| 2.5 | **SUBSTITUTE ALL** known symbols + candidate into Context B |
| 2.6 | **IDENTIFY** all other known symbols in Context C |
| 2.7 | **SUBSTITUTE ALL** known symbols + candidate into Context C |
| 2.8 | **CHECK**: Does the FULLY substituted sentence make coherent sense? |
| 2.9 | **CHECK**: Does it contradict Torah? |
| 2.10 | **CHECK**: Does it create redundancy with another law? |
| 2.11 | **CHECK**: Does it fit the production chain? (for physical symbols) |
| 2.12 | **CHECK**: Can it be bought/sold if Scripture says so? |

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>CRITICAL:</strong> At step 2.1, you MUST actually look up the symbols. Do NOT rely on memory. Memory fails. The documented definition is the source of truth.

<strong>CRITICAL:</strong> When substituting, substitute ALL known symbols in the verse, not just the candidate. The new symbol must fit coherently with the entire symbolic sentence.
</div>

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example (Testing OIL = Proven Works):</strong>

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Original | "Burning **oil** produces **light**" |
| Identify known | LIGHT = Example / Visible Example |
| Substitute ALL | "Burning **[Proven Works]** produces **[Visible Example]**" |
| Coherence | ✓ Expending proven works produces a visible example |
</div>

### Phase 3: Compare Candidates in a Table

Create an **explicit** comparison table. Do not evaluate "in your head."

| Criterion | Candidate #1 | Candidate #2 | Candidate #3 |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Fits Context A | ✓ / ✗ + reason | | |
| Fits Context B | | | |
| Fits Context C | | | |
| No Torah violation | | | |
| No legal redundancy | | | |
| Production chain fits | | | |
| Coherent with existing symbols | | | |
| **TOTAL** | ___ / 7 | ___ / 7 | ___ / 7 |

### Phase 4: Select Best Fit with Documented Reasoning

1. **Winner**: State which candidate scored highest
2. **Reasoning**: Explain why
3. **Weaknesses**: Note remaining concerns
4. **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low

<div class="method-section">
<strong>Why This Process Matters:</strong>

| Failure Mode | This Process Prevents It By |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| First intuition bias | Forcing 3 candidates minimum |
| Dictionary trap | Explicit rejection filter |
| Memory error | Mandatory lookup step |
| Mental math | Written substitution requirement |
| Confirmation bias | Structured comparison table |

<strong>The process IS the protection.</strong> Skipping steps reintroduces the failure modes.
</div>

## How to Study a Symbol (Human Guide)

### Step 1: Gather Every Occurrence

Search the Bible for every verse containing your target word. Use a concordance or Bible software to find:

- **Definitional verses**: Where Scripture says "X IS Y" 
- **Parallel verses**: Where the word appears alongside other concepts
- **Antithetical verses**: Where it's contrasted with its opposite
- **Behavioral commands**: Instructions like "walk in X" or "be children of X"

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>Important:</strong> Look up the Strong's number for your word. The same Hebrew/Greek word may be translated differently in other verses. Search by Strong's number to catch ALL occurrences, not just those matching your English search term.
</div>
- **What it DOES**: Verbs and actions associated with the word

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example (LIGHT):</strong> Searching "light" reveals verses like "God IS light" (1 John 1:5), "Ye ARE the light of the world" (Matt 5:14), and "Let your light SHINE before men" (Matt 5:16).
</div>

### Step 2: Look for Explicit Definitions

Does Scripture directly define this symbol? Look for "X IS Y" statements:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "X IS Y" | "Thy word IS truth" (John 17:17) |
| "X IS like Y" | "The kingdom of heaven IS LIKE a mustard seed" |
| Christ claims to BE X | "I AM the light of the world" |

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>Principle:</strong> When Scripture explicitly defines something, that's your starting point. Don't overcomplicate what God has made plain.
</div>

### Step 3: Examine the Opposite

What is the explicit opposite of your symbol in Scripture?

| Symbol | Opposite | What This Reveals |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| LIGHT | Darkness | Hidden vs. visible |
| TRUTH | Lie | God's standard vs. deception |
| FAITH | Unbelief | Obedience vs. disobedience |

A word's opposite often clarifies its meaning. If darkness represents hidden evil, then light represents visible righteousness.

### Step 4: Ask What It DOES (Not Just What It IS)

Every symbol has two dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Example (WICKEDNESS) |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **IS** | What is it? | Lawlessness |
| **DOES** | What does it do? | Burns, devours, self-destructs |

Don't stop at identifying what something IS—always ask what it DOES. The functional dimension often reveals deeper meaning.

### Step 5: Test for Human Application

Ask: **"Can humans BE this thing?"**

- "God is light" ✓
- "Ye are the light of the world" ✓

If it works for BOTH God AND humans, you likely have the correct symbolic meaning. If it only works for God, you may have found a partial meaning.

### Step 6: Substitute and Test

Replace your proposed meaning in key verses. Does it still make sense?

| Verse | With "Visible Example" |
|-------|------------------------|
| "God is light" | "God is [visible example]" ✓ |
| "Ye are the light of the world" | "Ye are the [visible example] of the world" ✓ |
| "Let your light shine" | "Let your [example] shine" ✓ |

If substitution produces coherent meaning across diverse verses, you've found the symbolic meaning.

### Step 7: Avoid Literal Synonyms

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>Critical Check:</strong> Is your proposed meaning just a dictionary synonym?

| Proposed | Test |
|----------|------|
| ROCK = "Stone" | ❌ Literal synonym |
| ROCK = "Foundation" | ❌ Still physical |
| ROCK = "Covenant" | ✓ Symbolic meaning |

If your answer is close to the dictionary definition, you haven't found the symbolic meaning yet. Keep digging.
</div>

## Advanced Principles

### Recursive Definitions

Some symbols are defined in terms of OTHER symbols:

```
TRUTH = WORD (John 17:17)
WORD = LAW (Psalm 119:142)
LAW = God's Commandments
```

When you find these chains, trace them back to the foundational concept.

### Symbol Pairings

When two symbols appear TOGETHER, their relationship reveals additional meaning:

<div class="example-block">
<strong>TREE + ANIMAL (Daniel 4):</strong>

- The great TREE = Babylon (empire)
- The ANIMALS dwell UNDER the tree

The spatial relationship (under) reveals hierarchical meaning: Tree = dominant empire, Animals = subordinate tribes/peoples.
</div>

### Use Parables as Symbol Keys

Parables are controlled contexts where **multiple symbols appear together** and Scripture often **explicitly interprets them**.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13):</strong>

| Symbol | Jesus' Definition |
|--------|-------------------|
| SEED | "The word" (v.19) |
| GROUND | The heart |
| THORNS | "Care of this world, deceitfulness of riches" (v.22) |

Since TREE = Nation/People, and thorns are a type of plant:
**THORNS = A type of people** characterized by worldly cares, riches — they CHOKE others.
</div>

**Test your meanings**: Substitute ALL your symbol definitions into a parable. Do they work together coherently? If one breaks, re-evaluate.

### Comparative Metaphors

Ask: **"What does Scripture compare TO this symbol?"**

Don't just ask "what does a tree represent?" Ask "what is COMPARED to a tree?"

- Isaiah 5:7 — Israel IS a vineyard
- Daniel 4:22 — Nebuchadnezzar IS the tree
- Ezekiel 31:3 — Assyria WAS a cedar

The pattern of comparisons reveals the meaning.

### Context Importation

Words carry their biblical context into every occurrence. When you see "moment" in a verse, it imports the subject matter from all its other uses (judgment, sudden destruction, divine action).

---

## Problem-Driven Analysis

The most powerful breakthroughs come from **reasoning from problems**, not just cataloguing patterns.

### Start with Paradoxes

Look for verses that seem to **contradict** each other. The resolution of the paradox reveals the deeper meaning.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example: The Abraham Paradox (NAME)</strong>

| Observation | Tension |
|-------------|---------|
| Exodus 6:3 — "by my name YHWH I was not known" to Abraham | The NAME was NOT KNOWN |
| Genesis 15:7 — "I am YHWH who brought you out" (to Abraham) | Yet YHWH was clearly SPOKEN |

**Resolution**: If Abraham spoke the word YHWH but didn't "know the NAME," then NAME ≠ the pronunciation. It must mean something deeper — the COVENANT relationship.
</div>

### The "Magic Word" Test

If merely **saying the word** doesn't accomplish what Scripture promises, the meaning must be deeper.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example: Praying "in Jesus' Name"</strong>

- Jesus promised: "Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it" (John 14:13)
- Yet prayers ending "in Jesus' name" often go unanswered
- Matthew 7:22-23: People who said "Lord, Lord" and did miracles "in thy name" were rejected as "workers of **lawlessness**"

**Resolution**: "In my name" ≠ magic words. It means within the COVENANT relationship, with covenant obedience.
</div>

### The Relationship Test

When a symbol involves **invoking** or **calling upon** something, ask:

> "What RELATIONSHIP is being invoked?"

| Phrase | What Relationship? |
|--------|-------------------|
| "In the NAME of the king" | Subject/ruler COVENANT |
| "Believe on his NAME" | Trust in His COVENANT promises |
| "For his NAME's sake" | Because of His COVENANT commitment |
| "Baptized in the NAME" | Entering COVENANT relationship |

### Find Explicit Equations

Search for verses where Scripture **substitutes** one term for another:

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example: NAME = ARK = COVENANT</strong>

- 2 Samuel 7:2 — David wants to build a house for "the **ark** of God"
- 2 Samuel 7:13 — God says: "He shall build a house for **My NAME**"

God substitutes "My NAME" for "the ark of the covenant" — they are the same thing.
</div>

### Concentrated Passage Analysis

Find passages where the word appears **many times**. The context reveals the meaning.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example: Solomon's Prayer (1 Kings 8)</strong>

"The NAME" appears 16 times — always in COVENANT context:
- Forgiveness of sins
- Repentance and return  
- Foreigners coming "for thy name's sake"

Pattern: THE NAME = THE COVENANT
</div>

### The Incongruity Test

When a word seems **out of place**, **random**, or **unnecessary**, ask:

> "Why is this mentioned HERE? What does it add?"

Apparent randomness is often a signal of **intentional symbolic design**.

<div class="example-block">
<strong>Example: 153 Fish (John 21:11)</strong>

"Simon Peter... drew the net to land full of great fishes, **an hundred and fifty and three**"

Why specify 153? It seems oddly precise. The incongruity signals intentional meaning — the number invites symbolic investigation.
</div>

<div class="principle-box">
<strong>Principle:</strong> Scripture is intentionally designed. Nothing is truly "random." When you think "why is this here?" — that's your cue to look for symbolic meaning.
</div>

## The Quick-Start Checklist

Before deep analysis, quickly answer these questions:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Is there an EXPLICIT definition? ("X IS Y") |
| 2 | What is the OPPOSITE? |
| 3 | What is COMPARED TO this symbol? |
| 4 | What VERBS accompany it? |
| 5 | Can humans BE this? |
| 6 | Is my proposed meaning a literal synonym? |
| 7 | Are there PARADOXES? (verses that seem to contradict) |
| 8 | Does saying the word accomplish the promise? (magic word test) |
| 9 | Is this an INVOCATION symbol? (ask what RELATIONSHIP is invoked) |
| 10 | Is there a CONCENTRATED PASSAGE? (word appears many times) |
| 11 | Does this word seem OUT OF PLACE or random? (incongruity = intentional) |
| 12 | Would proposed meaning create LEGAL REDUNDANCY? (if another law handles it, meaning must differ) |
| 13 | HOW IS THIS THING MADE? What is it made FROM? (trace production chain) |

---

## Trace the Symbol's Origin (Production Chain)

For physical symbols, ask: **"How is this made? What is it made FROM?"**

Then connect each step to known symbols.

**Example: OIL**

| Stage | Physical | Symbolic |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Source | Olive Tree | Covenant Community (TREE) |
| Fruit | Olives | Works (FRUIT) |
| Process | Pressing | Trials/Testing |
| Product | Oil | **Proven Works** |

This exposed why "OIL = Spirit" is wrong:
- Spirit is a **gift** that cannot be bought (Acts 8:20)
- But Matthew 25:9 says "go **buy**" oil
- Therefore OIL = something acquirable = **Proven Works**

---

## The Redundancy Test

If a proposed meaning would create **legal redundancy** with an existing law, it must be wrong.

**Example**: "Divorce except for fornication" (Matthew 5:32)

- Sexual adultery = **death penalty** under Torah (Leviticus 20:10)
- If adultery = death, you don't need divorce provisions for it
- Therefore "fornication" must mean something else: **idolatry**

This test resolved centuries of debate about divorce grounds.

---

## Symbol Categories

Different types of symbols require different analysis approaches:

| Category | Examples | Primary Analysis |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **Events** | Moment, Sleep | Look at accompanying VERBS |
| **Characters** | Virgin, Harlot | Look at OPPOSITE character |
| **Actions** | Faith, Believe | Look at behavioral commands |
| **Standards** | Truth | Look at recursive definitions |
| **Structures** | Mountain, Rock | Follow symbolic chain deeper |
| **Relationships** | Island, Sea | Analyze position relative to other symbols |

---

## Output Format

When documenting a symbol study, include:

1. **One-word meaning** — The most concise summary
2. **Two-word meaning** — Slightly expanded
3. **Sentence meaning** — Full explanation
4. **Opposite** — What contrasts with this symbol
5. **Key proof texts** — Verses that establish the meaning
6. **Substitution test** — Showing the meaning works in context

---

<div class="method-section">
<strong>Remember:</strong> The goal is not to impose meaning but to DISCOVER what Scripture itself reveals. When multiple lines of evidence converge on the same meaning—explicit definitions, opposites, functional analysis, and substitution tests all agree—you can be confident you've found the symbolic meaning.
</div>
