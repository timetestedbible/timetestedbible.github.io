          - Dark conjunction: 15th = Sunday → FAILS
          - Visible crescent: 15th = Monday → FAILS
          - Full moon: 15th = Sunday → FAILS
          No continuous-cycle calendar has Saturday on 15th. Only lunar Sabbath works.

        reasoning: |
          All four Gospels agree crucifixion was on preparation day (day before Sabbath).
          Under traditional calendars, 32 AD Passover falls on Monday/Tuesday - NOT preparation day.
          Under lunar Sabbath, Passover (14th) is ALWAYS 6th day (preparation).
          This is why scholars avoid 32 AD despite overwhelming evidence.

        facts: [Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths, ExodusDate, AstronomicalStability]
        reasoning: "The visible crescent was easily seen (1.5 days, 2.4% illuminated). Under this calendar, 15th = Friday. Scripture requires 15th = Sabbath."

        reasoning: |
          1. Resolves consecutive 15ths being Sabbaths (impossible with continuous cycle)
          2. Resolves First Fruits paradox (16th always first day of week)
          3. Passes all historical calendar tests
          4. Solves dateline problem without modern technology
          5. Compatible with 32 AD crucifixion on preparation day
