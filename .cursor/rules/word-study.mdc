# Word Study Methodology

When creating or analyzing biblical word/symbol studies, you MUST follow this process.

## CRITICAL: Show Your Work

**You MUST explicitly show your work at every step.** Do NOT do "mental math" or keep analysis in your head. Write out:
- Every search you perform and its results
- Every verse you examine
- Every candidate meaning you consider
- Every substitution test with explicit before/after

## Available Resources - USE THEM

You have access to these resources in this codebase:

| Resource | Location | Usage |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **KJV Bible** | `/http/kjv.txt` | Tab-separated: Reference\tVerse text |
| **ASV Bible** | `/http/asv.txt` | Space-separated reference |
| **Septuagint (LXX)** | `/http/lxx.txt` | Greek OT translation |
| **Strong's Hebrew** | `/http/strongs-hebrew-dictionary.js` | Hebrew word definitions |
| **Strong's Greek** | `/http/strongs-greek-dictionary.js` | Greek word definitions |
| **Symbol Dictionary** | `/http/symbol-dictionary.js` | Existing symbol meanings |
| **Existing Studies** | `/symbols/*.md` | Completed word studies |

## Required Tools - USE GREP

**You MUST use grep/search tools** to find occurrences. Do NOT rely on memory.

```bash
# Find all verses containing a word
rg -i "fornication" http/kjv.txt

# Find Strong's number occurrences (if interlinear data available)
rg "H2181" http/

# Compare across translations
rg -i "peace" http/kjv.txt http/asv.txt

# Find in Septuagint for OT concepts
rg -i "word" http/lxx.txt
```

## The Process (Execute Step by Step)

### Phase 1: Gather Data (SHOW YOUR WORK)
1. **Look up Strong's number** - Find the Hebrew/Greek word
2. **Search KJV** - `rg -i "word" http/kjv.txt` - list results
3. **Search ASV** - `rg -i "word" http/asv.txt` - compare translations
4. **Check LXX** - For OT words, see Greek translation choices
5. **Find ALL translation variants** - Same Strong's # may be translated differently

### Phase 2: Generate Candidates (Minimum 3)
1. Write down Candidate #1 (first intuition)
2. **REJECT CHECK**: Is this a dictionary synonym? If YES → discard
3. Assume #1 is WRONG → Generate Candidate #2
4. Assume #2 is WRONG → Generate Candidate #3

### Phase 3: Test Each Candidate (SHOW SUBSTITUTIONS)
For each candidate, explicitly:
1. Look up related symbols from symbol-dictionary.js
2. Find 3+ test verses
3. Write out the verse with ALL symbols substituted
4. Check: Does it make coherent sense?

### Phase 4: Compare in Table
Create explicit comparison table - do NOT evaluate "in your head":

| Criterion | Candidate 1 | Candidate 2 | Candidate 3 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Fits verse A | ✓/✗ reason | | |
| Fits verse B | | | |
| No Torah violation | | | |
| Production chain | | | |

## Output Format

```markdown
# SYMBOL — Symbolic Word Study

## Final Meaning
| Form | Symbolic Meaning |
|------|------------------|
| **One Word** | X |
| **Two Words** | X Y |
| **Sentence** | Full explanation |

**Opposite**: [antonym symbol]

## The Argument
[Show your work: searches performed, verses found, substitution tests]
```
