# Pipeline Agent — Symbol Research

When working on symbol studies or verse analysis, you ARE the research agent. You have tools. USE THEM.

## Identifying New Symbols

When reading any Scripture passage, look for these patterns that signal a potential new symbol:

1. **Compound actions**: A known symbol acting on another known symbol (e.g., MOUNTAIN cast into SEA = kingdom destroyed among nations). The ACTION between two symbols creates a third meaning.

2. **Recurring phrases**: The same phrase appearing in 3+ passages across different books/eras. Search for it — if it recurs, it's a pattern.

3. **"Out of place" details**: A detail that seems disconnected from the narrative (a food, a time, a material, a number). Search for where else that detail appears.

4. **Structural patterns**: "X against X", "in a moment", "come out of", "fallen fallen". The structure IS the symbol.

## Research Process — USE YOUR TOOLS

When studying a symbol, do NOT rely on memory alone. Actually search:

```
# Search KJV for English words
grep -i "phrase" source/bibles/kjv.txt

# Search with Strong's numbers in the interlinear
grep "H1234" bibles/kjv_strongs.txt

# Check existing symbol studies
cat pipeline/symbols/related-symbol.md

# Check the symbol dictionary
grep -i "word" symbol-dictionary.js

# Check Strong's definitions
grep "H1234" strongs-hebrew-dictionary.js

# Check multiple translations
grep -i "phrase" bibles/ylt.txt bibles/asv_strongs.txt
```

## File Locations

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| KJV | `source/bibles/kjv.txt` (tab-separated: Ref\tText) |
| KJV+Strong's | `bibles/kjv_strongs.txt` |
| ASV+Strong's | `bibles/asv_strongs.txt` |
| YLT | `bibles/ylt.txt` |
| LXX | `bibles/lxx.txt` |
| Strong's Hebrew | `strongs-hebrew-dictionary.js` |
| Strong's Greek | `strongs-greek-dictionary.js` |
| BDB | `data/bdb-ai.json` |
| MorphHB | `data/morphhb.json` |
| Symbol Dictionary | `symbol-dictionary.js` |
| Pipeline symbols | `pipeline/symbols/*.md` |
| Pipeline contexts | `pipeline/contexts/**/*.md` |
| Full symbol studies | `symbols/*.md` |
| Cross-references | `cross_references.txt` |

## Symbol Study Methodology (abbreviated)

1. **Exhaustive search** by Strong's numbers, not English words
2. **7+ candidates** before evaluating — assume each is wrong, generate next
3. **Substitution tests** — replace meaning in 5+ diverse verses, must pass ALL
4. **Reject dictionary synonyms** — would a secular reader arrive at this?
5. **Resolve symbolic recursion** — trace to concrete concepts
6. **Production chain** — how is this thing physically made?
7. **Show your work** — mental math = failure

## Pipeline File Format

When writing to `pipeline/symbols/*.md`, use YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
symbol: key-name
name: DISPLAY NAME
strongs: [H1234, G5678]
words: ["word1", "word2"]
role: noun-symbol / verb-symbol / structural-pattern
meaning: one-line meaning (NOT a dictionary synonym)
opposite: opposite symbol
defining_verses: [7 most important verse refs]
co_occurring: [related symbols]
context_types: [prophetic oracle, narrative, etc.]
all_verses: [every verse checked]
rev: 1
churn: 1.00
inputs: {}

## Key Principles

- **Literal → Symbols → Literal**: Symbols bridge concrete events to produce concrete expectations
- **Nothing is accidental**: Every detail in Scripture earns its place
- **Pattern is prophecy**: History rhymes; past events define future patterns
- **Fresh eyes**: Do NOT assume tradition is correct
- **Full discourse scope**: Check ALL elements of a prophecy, not just a convenient slice
- **Honest fulfillment audit**: Note what's fulfilled AND what's NOT
- **Prophetic roadmap**: Every analysis should note which major events it illuminates (rapture, return, Babylon's fall, sudden destruction, days of Noah, third day, day as 1000 years)
