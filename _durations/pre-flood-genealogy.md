# Pre-Flood Genealogy Chain

## Overview

The pre-flood genealogy establishes dates from Adam to the Flood via a chain of birth ages. The anchor point is **Methuselah's death**, which coincides with the Flood (he died the year the flood began).

| methuselah-birth | enoch-birth | 65 | Gen 5:21 "Enoch lived 65 years, and begat Methuselah" |
| methuselah-birth | lamech-birth | 187 | Gen 5:25 "Methuselah lived 187 years, and begat Lamech" |
| lamech-birth | noah-birth | 182 | Gen 5:28-29 "Lamech lived 182 years, and begat a son... Noah" |

## Calculation

Total years from Adam to Methuselah's death (Flood):
- 130 + 105 + 90 + 70 + 65 + 162 + 65 + 187 + 182 + (600 - Noah's age at flood) = 1656 AM

## Cross-Validation

Methuselah died the year of the flood:
- Methuselah born: 687 AM (Enoch at 65 + ancestors)
- Methuselah lived: 969 years
- Methuselah died: 687 + 969 = 1656 AM
- Flood: 1656 AM ✓
