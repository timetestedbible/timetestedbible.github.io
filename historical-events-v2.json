Joshua prayed: 'Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.' This was a natural celestial alignment where the sun and moon appeared in opposition (full moon phase, ~90-99% illuminated), both visible simultaneously during daylight—interpreted in ANE omen practices as celestial bodies 'standing still' or 'being silent' (Hebrew damam), a divine sign. The biblical geometry precisely describes the locations: From Upper Beth Horon (observer: 31.87722°N, 35.11861°E), Gibeon (31.84750°N, 35.18639°E) was at ~118° azimuth (sun high in sky at dawn), while Aijalon (31.84028°N, 35.02250°E) was at ~296° azimuth (moon low on opposite horizon). The Book of Jasher (88:63-64) specifies this phenomenon lasted 36 moments (~36 minutes). More Amorites died from hailstones than from Israel's swords. The five kings hid in a cave at Makkedah—typological of the Day of the Lord when kings hide in caves (Revelation 6:15-17). The Gibeonites (Canaanites who made covenant with Israel) were spared—typological of nations seeking the LORD in the last days (Zechariah 8:20-23).",

Because Tyre gloated over Jerusalem's fall ('The gate to the nations is broken... I will be filled'), God declares judgment: **many nations will rise like waves**, Tyre will become **a bare rock for spreading nets**, and will **never be rebuilt**. While historically Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander partially fulfilled this, the 'never rebuilt' clause (v. 14, 21) suggests a dual/typological layer pointing to **Babylon the Great** (Revelation 17-18). Revelation 18 directly echoes Ezekiel 26-27: merchants/kings weeping, sudden ruin, 'found no more forever.' Ezekiel 28's description of Tyre's king as a fallen cherub in Eden links to satanic influence behind the final Antichrist system.",
