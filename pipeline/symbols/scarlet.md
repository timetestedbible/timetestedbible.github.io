symbol: scarlet
name: SCARLET
strongs: [H8144, H8438, G2847]
words: ["scarlet", "scarlet thread", "scarlet colour", "crimson", "scarlet coloured"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: The bloodline of covenant — whether salvation (scarlet cord = Rahab's deliverance, Josh 2:18; scarlet wool + blood at Sinai, Heb 9:19) or sin (Isa 1:18 "sins as scarlet"). The dye comes from the crushed body of the tola'ath worm (H8438), connecting scarlet to death-produced covering. Babylon the Great wears scarlet (Rev 17:4) — she mimics covenant-blood covering with counterfeit luxury.
opposite: WHITE (Isa 1:18 "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow" — scarlet = sin-stained; white = cleansed)

**H8144 shani** = "crimson; properly the insect or its color, also stuff dyed with it" — of uncertain derivation. KJV: crimson, scarlet (thread). **H8438 tola/tola'ath** = "a maggot (as voracious); specifically the crimson-GRUB" from H3216 yala (to devour). Often paired with H8144 as construct: tola'ath shani = "scarlet-worm crimson." The COLOR comes from a CRUSHED WORM — the kermes insect (Kermes vermilio), female body dried and ground to produce dye. **G2847 kokkinos** = "crimson-colored" from G2848 kokkos (kernel/grain) — from the kernel-shape of the insect. Production chain: worm → crushed → dye → scarlet fabric. The color inherently carries DEATH-to-produce-covering.

## Context Bag

Gen 38:28-30 — subj: SCARLET THREAD (H8144) bound on ZERAH's hand during birth — "this came out first." But PEREZ (breach) breaks through first. Zerah (H2226 = "rising/dawning") marked with scarlet = firstborn-marker. co: THREAD, BIRTH. Scarlet marks the COVENANT LINE. Perez (ancestor of David/Christ) supersedes the scarlet-marked one. Pattern: election bypasses the visibly marked.
Josh 2:18, 21 — subj: RAHAB binds scarlet (H8144) CORD (H8615 tiqvah = also "hope/expectation") in her WINDOW. Spies: "when we come into the land" — scarlet line = salvation marker. co: WINDOW, HOPE. Passover parallel: blood on doorposts = scarlet cord in window. House-inhabitants saved if they stay INSIDE. Tiqvah = "cord" AND "hope" — same word. Scarlet cord IS hope. Rahab = Gentile harlot saved by covenant-blood-sign.
Exod 25:4, 26:1,31,36, 27:16, 28:5-8,15,33, etc. (40+ occurrences) — subj: TABERNACLE construction. Scarlet (H8144+H8438) woven with BLUE (H8504 tekeleth) + PURPLE (H713 argaman) + fine LINEN (H8336 shesh) into curtains, veil, hangings, ephod, breastplate, pomegranates on high priest's robe. co: BLUE, PURPLE, FINE_LINEN, GOLD. FOUR COLORS of the tabernacle: blue (heavenly), purple (royalty), scarlet (blood/sacrifice), white linen (righteousness). Scarlet is ALWAYS in the set — never alone. It represents the blood-element within the full covenant structure.
Lev 14:4-6, 49-52 — subj: CLEANSING of leper/leprous house. SCARLET (H8144+H8438) + CEDAR wood + HYSSOP + living bird dipped in blood of slain bird over running water. Living bird released. co: BLOOD, CEDAR, HYSSOP, BIRD. Cleansing ritual: scarlet + cedar + hyssop = the binding material soaked in blood. Heb 9:19 (NT parallel): scarlet wool + hyssop used at covenant inauguration. Scarlet = the material that CARRIES blood — the vehicle of atonement.
Num 4:8 — subj: SCARLET cloth spread over table of showbread for transport. co: BREAD. Scarlet covers the BREAD of presence during wilderness journey. Blood-covering over the bread of life.
Num 19:6 — subj: RED HEIFER ashes: priest casts CEDAR + HYSSOP + SCARLET into the burning. co: FIRE, CEDAR, HYSSOP. Purification water. Same trio (cedar+hyssop+scarlet) as leper-cleansing. Scarlet burned = worm-dye consumed in fire = death upon death. Ultimate purification involves scarlet's destruction.
Isa 1:18 — subj: "though your sins be as SCARLET (H8144), white as snow; though red as CRIMSON (H8438 tola), as wool." co: WHITE, SNOW, WOOL. BOTH Hebrew words for scarlet used: shani + tola. Sin-color = the worm-dye. Cleansing reversal: scarlet → white. The blood-stain is removable only by a greater blood.
2Sam 1:24 — subj: Saul clothed daughters of Israel in SCARLET with delights + gold ornaments. co: GOLD. Royal provision. Scarlet = king's luxury given to people.
Prov 31:21 — subj: virtuous woman's household clothed in SCARLET (H8144) — "not afraid of snow." co: SNOW. Practical: scarlet wool = warm/durable. Symbolic: her household is blood-covered, protected. Isa 1:18 reversal: snow threatens but scarlet-clothed household endures.
Song 4:3 — subj: bride's lips = thread of SCARLET (H8144). co: BRIDE, POMEGRANATE. Scarlet lips = speech carrying the blood-covenant. Beauty of covenant-speech.
Jer 4:30 — subj: Judah "clothest thyself with CRIMSON (H8144), deckest with gold, rentest face with painting — in vain make thyself fair; thy LOVERS despise thee." co: GOLD, HARLOT. Harlot-imagery: scarlet clothing + gold adornment to attract lovers = counterfeit covenant. Directly parallels Rev 17:4.
Mat 27:28 — subj: soldiers put SCARLET (G2847) robe on Jesus before crucifixion. co: MOCKERY, KING. Scarlet = royal/military garment. Mockery: "king of Jews" in scarlet. But the worm-dye robe on the Crushed One = Ps 22:6 "I am a WORM (H8438 tola'ath = SAME WORD as crimson-grub), not a man." Jesus IS the tola'ath — the scarlet worm crushed to produce the dye that covers sin.
Heb 9:19 — subj: Moses took blood + water + SCARLET WOOL (G2847 + G2053) + hyssop, sprinkled book + people. co: BLOOD, HYSSOP, COVENANT. Covenant inauguration at Sinai. Scarlet wool = the material vehicle of covenant-blood application. Wool (from lamb) dyed scarlet (from worm) = sacrifice-upon-sacrifice.
Rev 17:3-4 — subj: harlot on SCARLET (G2847) beast; woman arrayed in PURPLE + SCARLET + gold + stones + pearls. Golden cup full of abominations. co: HARLOT, BEAST, PURPLE, GOLD, PEARL, BABYLON_THE_GREAT. Scarlet beast = blood-soaked imperial power. Scarlet clothing = counterfeit priestly garment. The harlot wears tabernacle colors (purple+scarlet+gold) WITHOUT the blue (heavenly) and WITHOUT the white linen (righteousness). She has the FORM of covenant without the substance.
Rev 18:12, 16 — subj: Babylon's merchandise includes SCARLET. The great city "clothed in fine linen, purple, scarlet, decked with gold, stones, pearls." co: FALL_OF_BABYLON, COMMERCE. Scarlet commodified — covenant-marker reduced to trade good.

**CANDIDATES**: (1) Sin/guilt → Isa 1:18, but doesn't work in tabernacle, Josh 2, Gen 38. (2) Royal luxury → 2Sam 1:24, Prov 31:21, Rev 17:4 — partial. (3) Blood → production from crushed worm parallels blood; scarlet carries blood in ritual — strong. (4) Covenant-blood marker → Gen 38 (covenant line), Josh 2 (salvation marker), Heb 9:19 (covenant inauguration), Lev 14 (cleansing) — strong. (5) Sacrifice/death → tola'ath worm crushed to produce dye; Mat 27:28 + Ps 22:6 — strong. (6) Counterfeit covenant → Rev 17:4, Jer 4:30 — tabernacle colors without substance — partial. (7) Bloodline of covenant — whether authentic (tabernacle, Rahab, cleansing) or counterfeited (harlot, Babylon) = BEST composite. Substitution: Gen 38 ✓ (covenant-line marker), Josh 2 ✓ (blood-sign salvation), tabernacle ✓ (blood-element in covenant structure), Lev 14 ✓ (blood-vehicle), Isa 1:18 ✓ (sin = false covenant-blood), Rev 17 ✓ (counterfeit covenant-blood garment), Mat 27:28 ✓ (the True Worm producing the true dye).

**PATTERNS**: (1) TOLA'ATH = WORM = SCARLET: H8438 means BOTH "worm" and "crimson." Ps 22:6 "I am a tola'ath" + Mat 27:28 scarlet robe = Christ IS the scarlet worm — crushed to produce the covenant-covering dye. (2) TABERNACLE QUAD: blue+purple+scarlet+white linen = heavenly+royal+blood+righteous. Rev 17:4 harlot has purple+scarlet+gold but NO BLUE, NO WHITE LINEN. She counterfeits 2/4 and substitutes gold for the missing two. The ABSENCE reveals the counterfeit. (3) SCARLET CORD = PASSOVER BLOOD: Josh 2:18 (cord in window) ∥ Exod 12:7 (blood on doorpost). Both mark a house for salvation during destruction. Rahab (Gentile harlot) saved by the same sign as Israel. (4) CEDAR+HYSSOP+SCARLET trio: Lev 14, Num 19, Heb 9:19. Three materials bound together for cleansing. Cedar (great/tall) + hyssop (lowly/small) + scarlet (blood-stained) = the full range from great to small, bound by blood. (5) SCARLET → WHITE: Isa 1:18 is the ONLY color-transformation promise in Scripture. The deepest dye (kermes = permanent) made white. What is humanly unfixable, God reverses.
