## Context Bag

**Core identity**: Heb *ruach* H7307 = wind + breath + spirit + direction. Grk *anemos* G417 = wind/four quarters. Aram *ruach* H7308 = same (Daniel). Single word spans natural→spiritual intentionally: wind is the physical picture of spirit. Invisible, powerful, moves where it wills.

**Wind = Spirit**: Jesus explicitly (John 3:8) — wind blows where it wills, you hear but can't see origin/destination → "so is every one born of the Spirit." Natural wind || spiritual Spirit.

**Four winds = four spirits**: Zechariah 6:5 — angel interprets four chariots w/ colored horses as "four spirits of the heavens" that (1) stand before the Lord, (2) go forth on mission, (3) operate throughout all earth. FOUR WINDS ARE angelic executing forces dispatched from throne room.

**Four functions of four winds/spirits**:

1. **Scattering/judgment**: Jer 49:36 — four winds brought upon Elam → scattered to all nations. Zech 2:6 — "I have spread you abroad as the four winds." Dispersal = covenant judgment.

2. **Gathering/restoration**: Matt 24:31 — angels + trumpet gather elect "from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." Ezek 37:9 — "Come from the four winds, O breath" → breathe on slain dry bones → they live. Same winds that scatter also gather. Breath/spirit from four winds = resurrection power.

3. **Stirring nations**: Dan 7:2-3 — four winds strive upon great SEA → four great ANIMAL beasts rise. Spirits agitate nations (SEA) → produce kingdoms serving prophetic purposes. +SEA +ANIMAL.

4. **Restraining**: Rev 7:1 — four angels hold four winds at four corners of earth → wind not blow on earth, SEA, or TREE. Restraint until 144,000 sealed. Winds held = judgment delayed. +TREE +SEA.

**East wind specifically** → consistent = judgment/destruction. Gen 41:27 — east wind blasts ears = famine. Hos 12:1 — Ephraim feeds on wind, follows east wind (futility + IDOLATRY). Hos 13:15 — "wind of the LORD" from wilderness dries springs = covenant curse. Hab 1:9 — faces sup up as east wind (violence). East wind = from desert/wilderness = drying, destruction, specifically "wind of the LORD."

**Angels = spirits/winds**: Ps 104:4 — "maketh his angels spirits [ruach]; his ministers flaming fire." Angels ARE winds/spirits → God's ministers. Four winds of Zech 6 = angelic forces. +EAGLE (messenger/angel connection).

**Number FOUR** → whole earth (four corners, four directions). FOUR WINDS = spirits sent to WHOLE earth, universal execution of God's purposes.

**Symbol connections**: WIND + SEA (Dan 7:2-3, Rev 7:1) — spirits stir/restrain nations. WIND + ANIMAL (Dan 7:3) — beasts rise from stirred sea. WIND + TREE (Rev 7:1) — protected from wind judgment. WIND + GRASS (implied via TREE/earth scope). WIND → BREATH → life (Ezek 37:9). WIND → EAGLE/angel (Ps 104:4). WIND opposite = stillness/calm = God's restraint or inaction (Rev 7:1 — held back).
