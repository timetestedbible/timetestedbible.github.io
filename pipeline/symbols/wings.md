## Context Bag

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: H3671 (kanaph) = "wings" + "skirt" + "border/corner" — SAME WORD hidden by English translation. This single lexeme unifies bird wings, garment edges, covenant covering, and earth's corners.

EXPLICIT DEFINITION — Ezek 16:8: "spread my skirt (H3671) over thee… ENTERED INTO A COVENANT with thee." Spreading wings/skirt → entering covenant. Direct equation.

RUTH CONNECTION — Ruth 2:12: "under whose wings (H3671) thou art come to trust" || Ruth 3:9: "spread thy skirt (H3671) over me; for thou art a kinsman-redeemer." Same word links divine covenant protection → marital covenant request. Ruth came under God's covenant wings, then asked Boaz for covenant MARRIAGE covering. MARRIAGE + WINGS = covenant picture.

COVENANT TRUST — Ps 91:4: "under his wings shalt thou trust" → covenant shelter + FAITH (trusting obedience under covering).

COVENANT HEALING — Mal 4:2: "healing in his wings" → restoration through covenant relationship.

COVENANT OFFER REJECTED — Matt 23:37: hen gathers chicks "under her wings" → Yeshua offering covenant covering to JERUSALEM (bride/covenant community); they refused.

ARK CONNECTION — Exod 25:20: cherubim wings cover the ark of the COVENANT → wings physically overshadow covenant terms (BREAD/commandments inside ark). Wings + ROCK (covenant).

TZITZIT CONNECTION — Num 15:38-40: fringes placed on "borders" (H3671 kanaph) of garments → explicit purpose: (1) REMEMBER commandments, (2) DO commandments, (3) BE HOLY. Wings → THE WAY (Torah/commandments) + MARK (visible practice/observance). Deut 22:12: fringes on four "quarters" (H3671 kanaph) confirms. To come under wings = come under covenant = remember and obey Torah.

WINGS OF THE EARTH — Job 38:13: "ends (H3671) of the earth" + Isa 11:12: "four corners (H3671) of the earth." Wings of earth = coasts/seashores where land meets SEA (nations/chaotic peoples). Boundary zone where SAND (multitudes at covenant boundary) exists — where covenant is offered to nations.

LOGIC CHAIN: H3671 kanaph → covers birds, garments, earth-edges → all express protective covenant covering. Ezek 16:8 explicitly defines spreading kanaph = entering covenant. Tzitzit on kanaph = Torah reminder (Num 15:38-40). Therefore WINGS = covenant covering + Torah reminder. Under wings = under covenant = under commandments. Outside wings = exposed/uncovered = outside covenant.
