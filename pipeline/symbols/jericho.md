symbol: jericho
name: JERICHO
strongs: [H3405, H3394, H3391]
words: ["Jericho", "Jerecho"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: The first stronghold to fall under cherem-ban — the prototype of how God topples fortified systems through obedient process (circling, trumpets, shout), not human siege. Etymologically linked to moon (H3394 yareach) — the lunar city, ruled by reflected/borrowed light. Going DOWN to Jericho = descent from God's presence.
opposite: JERUSALEM (city of God's throne, UP — Jericho is always DOWN from Jerusalem)

## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H3405 Yericho — "perhaps from H3394 yareach (moon); its month; or else from H7306 ruach (fragrant)." Strong's preserves BOTH etymologies. H3394 yareach = the moon, from H3391 yerach = lunation/month. H3391 from unused root = lunar cycle. Moon connection: Jericho = "moon city" or "city of the month." H7306 ruach = to blow/smell → fragrant (city of balsam/palms). Dual etymology may be intentional: Jericho = city of reflected light + fragrance = attractive but borrowed glory. Deut 34:3 — "city of palm trees." ~60× OT, 7× NT.

**CONQUEST NARRATIVE (Josh 2-7):**
Josh 2:1-3 — Spies to Jericho; Rahab the HARLOT hides them. co: HARLOT, SCARLET (2:18 scarlet cord in window).
Josh 5:13 — Captain of LORD's host appears at Jericho, SWORD drawn. co: SWORD. God's army arrives before Israel's.
Josh 6:1 — Jericho "straitly shut up" (H5462×2 — double emphasis). Total enclosure = anti-cherem? City tries to seal itself.
Josh 6:2 — "I HAVE given" — perfect tense before battle. Done in divine decree.
Josh 6:3-5 — PROCESS: 7 priests + 7 trumpets + circuit city 1×/day for 6 days + 7× on day 7 + long blast + SHOUT → walls fall. co: TRUMPET. No siege engines, no human force. Obedient ritual process = God's weapon.
Josh 6:17-18 — CHEREM protocol: city is cherem to LORD. Taking cherem = becoming cherem = making camp cherem. Triple contagion. co: CHEREM.
Josh 6:20-21 — Walls fell flat; utterly destroyed (H2763 charam) all. co: SWORD.
Josh 6:25 — Rahab saved + household. The harlot inside Babylon-prototype escapes by faith + SCARLET marker. co: HARLOT.
Josh 6:26 — CURSE on rebuilder: firstborn at foundation, youngest at gates. co: FIRSTBORN, CURSE.
Josh 7:1-13 — Achan's breach: one man takes cherem → all Israel becomes cherem. CONTAGION. co: CHEREM.

**CURSE FULFILLED:**
1Kgs 16:34 — Hiel rebuilds Jericho: Abiram (firstborn) dies at foundation, Segub (youngest) at gates. Joshua's curse enacted ~500 years later. co: FIRSTBORN, CURSE. Occurs in Ahab's reign (peak apostasy). Rebuilding what God destroyed = defying cherem.

**PROPHETIC TYPE:**
2Kgs 25:5 / Jer 39:5 / Jer 52:8 — Zedekiah (last king) caught "in plains of Jericho" fleeing Babylon's army. The place of Israel's FIRST victory becomes place of LAST defeat. Inclusio: conquest began at Jericho → exile sealed at Jericho.
2Kgs 2:4-5,15,18 — Elijah's final journey includes Jericho; sons of prophets there witness Elisha's succession. Transitional city between old and new dispensation.

**DESCENT THEOLOGY (NT):**
Lk 10:30 — "A certain man went DOWN from Jerusalem to Jericho" — fell among thieves, stripped, wounded, half dead. Jerusalem→Jericho = descent from God's presence into danger. Jericho = the fallen world / place of vulnerability. Good Samaritan rescues.
Matt 20:29 / Mk 10:46 / Lk 18:35 — Jesus at Jericho: blind Bartimaeus healed (receives SIGHT). Lk 19:1 — Zacchaeus (tax collector) saved at Jericho. Salvation comes to the descent-city.
Heb 11:30 — "By FAITH the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days." Faith-catalog entry. Method = foolish by human standards, effective by divine.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **FIRST STRONGHOLD = PROTOTYPE.** Jericho = first Canaanite city under cherem. Every subsequent conquest measured against it (Josh 8:2, 10:1, 10:28, 10:30). The TEMPLATE for how God breaks fortified systems.
2. **MOON CITY = BORROWED LIGHT.** H3394 yareach (moon) → H3405 Yericho. Moon reflects sun; Jericho = system operating on reflected/derivative authority. Falls when TRUE light arrives.
3. **PROCESS NOT FORCE.** 7-day circuit + trumpets + shout → walls collapse. No battering rams. Obedient process = the weapon. Heb 11:30 makes faith the active agent.
4. **CHEREM CONTAGION.** Josh 6:17-18 → 7:1-13. Jericho = test case for cherem principle. One man's breach → corporate guilt. See cherem study.
5. **RAHAB EXCEPTION.** Harlot saved from inside the condemned city by SCARLET cord (blood marker) + faith. co: HARLOT. Gentile grafted into covenant line (Matt 1:5).
6. **DESCENT = VULNERABILITY.** Lk 10:30 — going DOWN to Jericho = leaving God's protection. Jericho sits ~800ft BELOW sea level (lowest city on earth). Geography enacts theology.
7. **FIRST VICTORY → LAST DEFEAT.** Josh 6 (entry to Promised Land) ‖ 2Kgs 25:5 (exit to exile). Same location bookends the entire monarchy.
