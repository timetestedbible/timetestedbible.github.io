## Strong's Data

**H7105 qatsir** — from H7114; "severed, i.e. harvest (as reaped), the crop, the time, the reaper, or figuratively; also a limb (of a tree, or simply foliage)." KJV: bough, branch, harvest(man). ~55× OT.
**H7114 qatsar** — primitive root; "to dock off, i.e. curtail; especially to harvest (grass or grain)." KJV: cut down, discouraged, grieve, harvestman, lothe, mourn, reap(-er), shorten, straiten, trouble, vex. ~49× OT.
**H4038 maggal** — "a sickle." From unused root = to reap. Only 2× OT: Jer 50:16, Joel 3:13.
**G2326 therismos** — from G2325; "reaping, i.e. the crop." 13× NT.
**G2325 therizo** — from G2330 (theros=summer/heat); "to harvest." 21× NT.
**G1407 drepanon** — from drep- (to pluck); "a gathering hook (esp. for harvesting)." 8× NT (Mark 4:29 + 7× Rev 14).
**G2327 theristes** — from G2325; "a harvester." 2× NT (Matt 13:30,39).

## Etymology: HARVEST and THE END Share a Root

H7105 qatsir (harvest) derives from H7114 qatsar = to CUT/sever.
H7093 qets (THE END) derives from H7112 qatsats = to CUT OFF.
Both from the same semantic domain: **cutting**. Hebrew embeds the connection: the END IS a harvest — a cutting/severing. Matt 13:39 makes this explicit: "the harvest IS (estin) the end (synteleia G4930) of the age (aion G165)." Not metaphor — equation.

## Context Bag

Matt 13:38-39 — subj: Jesus defines harvest. harvest = synteleia of age. reapers = angels. field = world. good seed = children of kingdom. tares = children of wicked one. enemy = devil. THE INTERPRETIVE KEY.
Rev 14:14-20 — subj: dual harvest. GRAIN (vv.14-16): Son of man, cloud, golden crown, sickle, earth reaped (G3583 dried). GRAPE (vv.17-19): angel from altar (fire-authority), clusters fully ripe (G187 akmazo), winepress of wrath. co: FIRE+WINE+ANGEL. Blood to horse bridles, 1600 furlongs.
Joel 3:13 — subj: sickle+harvest+press merged in one verse. co: WICKEDNESS. H1310 bashal = boiled/ripened. Rev separates Joel's merged verse into two sequential actions. "Press full, fats overflow" = fullness language.
Exo 23:16 — subj: two feasts = two harvests calendared. (1) Feast of Harvest/Weeks/Pentecost = wheat/spring. (2) Feast of Ingathering/Sukkot = grape/autumn. Acts 2 = Spirit-firstfruits. Tabernacles = final ingathering future. Feasts ARE the harvest enacted.
Jer 51:33 — subj: Babylon = threshingfloor. co: BABYLON, FALL_OF_BABYLON. Her harvest = her judgment. Jer 50:16 — sickle cut off FROM Babylon; she cannot reap.
Jer 8:20 — subj: missed harvest. "Harvest past, summer ended, not saved." Window CLOSES — appointed season. Isa 17:11 — harvest = heap in day of grief (wrong works).
Hos 6:11 — subj: God SETS (H7896 shith) harvest for Judah. co: EXILE. Timed to return from captivity.
Gal 6:7-9 — subj: sow→reap principle. Flesh→corruption. Spirit→life everlasting. "Due season" (G2398+G2540) = delayed but certain. Hos 8:7 — wind→WHIRLWIND (amplification). Hos 10:12-13, Prov 22:8, Jer 12:13, Job 4:8 confirm: sowing determines harvest type.
Matt 9:37-38 / John 4:35-38 / Luke 10:2 — subj: people as crop. "Harvest plenteous, laborers few." Fields white=ripe. One sows, another reaps. Fruit unto life eternal.
Mark 4:26-29 — subj: kingdom growth → sickle. Blade→ear→full corn→sickle. Triggered by ripeness, not arbitrary.
Ruth 1:22-2:23 — subj: Gentile gleaner in Israel's harvest. co: kinsman-redeemer (Boaz). Barley+wheat → marriage → lineage of David → Christ.
Lev 19:9, 23:22 — subj: gleaning law. NOT wholly reap corners; leave for poor+stranger. Deut 24:19 — forgotten sheaf for widow. Mercy within judgment; incomplete reaping mandated.
Prov 6:8, 10:5, 20:4, 25:13 — subj: harvest as accountability. Wise prepare; sluggard begs; sleeping in harvest = shame.

**PATTERNS**: (1) HARVEST=THE END ENACTED — both from "cutting" roots (H7114→H7105 || H7112→H7093). Matt 13:39 equates. Harvest adds: ripeness, dual outcome, gathering, reapers. (2) TWO HARVESTS=TWO FEASTS=TWO OUTCOMES — grain/Pentecost/Rev14:14-16 vs grape/Tabernacles/Rev14:17-20. (3) RIPENESS=FULLNESS — Joel 3:13, Rev 14:15,18. God waits for fullness (Gen 15:16). (4) SOW-REAP=CREATION ORDINANCE — Gen 8:22 pairs with day/night. Gal 6:7 "not mocked." (5) AMPLIFICATION — Hos 8:7 wind→whirlwind. 2Cor 9:6. (6) GLEANING=MERCY WITHIN JUDGMENT — Lev 19:9, Ruth. (7) JOEL→REV CHAIN — Joel 3:13 = template for Rev 14:15. (8) BABYLON AS THRESHINGFLOOR — Jer 51:33.

## Candidate Meanings (7+)

1. **Literal agricultural gathering** — seasonal crop-cutting. REJECT: fails in prophetic/apocalyptic contexts (Rev 14, Joel 3). Too surface-level.
2. **Final Judgment** — the last day of reckoning. PARTIAL: captures Rev 14 and Matt 13 but misses John 4:35 (spiritual harvest during ministry), wisdom texts (seasonal accountability), and sow-reap principle (ongoing).
3. **Consequence of sowing** — you reap what you sow. PARTIAL: captures Gal 6, Hos 8:7, Prov 22:8 but misses the GATHERING/SEPARATION dimension and the appointed-time element.
4. **The end of the age** — identical to THE END. REJECT: Matt 13:39 says harvest IS the end, but harvest adds specificity THE END lacks: mechanism (cutting), process (gathering/separating), dual outcome (barn/winepress), ripeness prerequisite.
5. **Soul-winning / evangelism** — gathering people to God. PARTIAL: fits Matt 9:37, John 4:35, Luke 10:2 but fails completely in judgment contexts (Rev 14:17-20, Joel 3:13, Jer 51:33).
6. **Appointed separation when accumulated works reach fullness** — combines: (a) appointed timing (Jer 5:24 "appointed weeks of harvest"), (b) ripeness/fullness prerequisite (Joel 3:13, Rev 14:15,18), (c) cutting/severing (etymology), (d) dual outcome (grain→barn, grape→winepress), (e) inevitable consequence of sowing (Gal 6:7). BEST FIT: works in ALL contexts. Test below.
7. **Cyclical divine accountability** — recurring harvest-seasons of testing. PARTIAL: captures wisdom texts and agricultural law but too weak for apocalyptic finality of Rev 14.
8. **Ripeness of wickedness triggering judgment** — Joel 3:13 "wickedness is great," Rev 14:18 "grapes fully ripe." PARTIAL: only captures judgment side, misses salvation harvest (Rev 14:14-16, John 4:35-38).

## Substitution Test — Candidate 6

**Meaning: The appointed separation when accumulated works reach fullness and are gathered to their outcome.**

- Gen 8:22: "seedtime and [appointed-separation-time] shall not cease" ✓ — the cycle of sowing→fullness→gathering is built into creation
- Matt 13:39: "the [appointed separation] is the consummation of the age; the [separators] are angels" ✓ — precisely this
- Rev 14:15: "the [appointed separation] of the earth is ripe" ✓ — fullness reached, cutting begins
- Joel 3:13: "put in the sickle, the [appointed separation] is ripe; wickedness is great" ✓ — fullness of wickedness triggers separation
- Jer 8:20: "the [appointed separation] is past... we are not saved" ✓ — missed the gathering window
- Jer 51:33: "daughter of Babylon... time of her [appointed separation] shall come" ✓ — Babylon's accumulated works reach fullness for judgment
- John 4:35: "fields white already to [appointed gathering]" ✓ — people's readiness has reached fullness
- Matt 9:37: "the [gathering of the ripe] is plenteous, laborers few" ✓ — many ready to be gathered
- Gal 6:7-9: "whatsoever sows, shall reap... in due season [the appointed gathering of our works]" ✓ — consequence arrives at appointed time
- Hos 6:11: "he hath set an [appointed separation] for thee" ✓ — God appoints the gathering
- Lev 19:9: "when ye reap the [appointed gathering] of your land, not wholly reap corners" ✓ — even in separation, leave a remnant
- Prov 10:5: "sleepeth in [the time of appointed gathering] = shame" ✓ — accountability moment missed

Works across ALL context types: agricultural law, wisdom, prophetic, parabolic, apocalyptic, discourse.

## Structural Findings

**HARVEST = THE END ENACTED.** THE END (G5056 telos / G4930 synteleia) = covenant purpose reaching fulfillment (see the-end.md). HARVEST (G2326 / H7105) = the MECHANISM of that fulfillment — the cutting, gathering, separating that constitutes the end. Etymology confirms: both derive from "cutting" roots (H7114 qatsar → H7105 qatsir || H7112 qatsats → H7093 qets). Matt 13:39 is the equation: harvest = synteleia. Harvest adds to THE END: ripeness prerequisite, dual outcome, gathering process, role of reapers (angels).

**TWO HARVESTS = TWO FEASTS = TWO OUTCOMES.** (1) Grain harvest / Feast of Harvest-Weeks-Pentecost / Rev 14:14-16 = gathering of righteous (into barn, Matt 13:30). (2) Grape harvest / Feast of Ingathering-Tabernacles / Rev 14:17-20 = gathering for winepress of wrath. Same earth, same sickle instrument, different crops, different destinations. The duality is calendared in Torah, enacted in feasts, fulfilled in Revelation.

**RIPENESS = FULLNESS OF WORKS.** Harvest cannot occur before ripeness. Joel 3:13 — "harvest is ripe... wickedness is great." Rev 14:15 — "harvest of earth is ripe (G3583 dried/ready)." Rev 14:18 — "grapes fully ripe (G187 akmazo = at peak)." Ripeness = accumulated works reaching their fullness. God waits for fullness (Gen 15:16 "iniquity of Amorites not yet full"). Harvest is triggered by ripeness, not by arbitrary divine timing.

**SOW-REAP = CREATION PRINCIPLE.** Gen 8:22 places seedtime-harvest alongside cold-heat, summer-winter, day-night = irreversible creation ordinances. The sow→reap principle is as fixed as sunrise. Gal 6:7 "God is not mocked" — this law cannot be circumvented. What is sown WILL be reaped. The harvest WILL come. Only the timing is uncertain (Gal 6:9 "due season").

**AMPLIFICATION.** Hos 8:7 — "sown wind, reap WHIRLWIND." Harvest amplifies the sowing. 2Cor 9:6 — "soweth sparingly → reap sparingly; bountifully → bountifully." The return exceeds the investment, both positive and negative. This is why harvest is terrifying for the wicked and joyful for the righteous (Isa 9:3 "joy in harvest"; Ps 126:5 "sow in tears, reap in joy").

**GLEANING = MERCY WITHIN JUDGMENT.** Lev 19:9, 23:22 — corners and gleanings left for poor/stranger. Ruth = Gentile gleaner in Israel's harvest. Even in the separation-event, God mandates provision for those outside the main covenant community. Gleaning is the mercy-remainder in the judgment-harvest.

**JOEL 3:13 → REV 14:15 CHAIN.** Joel's "put in the sickle, harvest is ripe" is the OT template for Revelation's apocalyptic harvest. Joel merges grain+grape into one verse; Rev expands into two sequential harvests. Joel adds: "press is full, fats overflow, wickedness is great" — the fullness language. This is the clearest cross-testament harvest prophecy: both use sickle + ripe + harvest in identical structure.

**BABYLON AS THRESHINGFLOOR.** Jer 51:33 — Babylon = threshingfloor, her harvest SHALL COME. Jer 50:16 — sickle cut off FROM Babylon. Babylon's harvest is not her gathering others but her own threshing. Co-occurs with FALL OF BABYLON pattern. The harvest-of-Babylon = the appointed fullness of Babylon's wickedness → judgment.
