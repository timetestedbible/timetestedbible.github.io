## Strong's Data

**H7105 qatsir** — from H7114; "severed, i.e. harvest (as reaped), the crop, the time, the reaper, or figuratively; also a limb (of a tree, or simply foliage)." KJV: bough, branch, harvest(man). ~55× OT.
**H7114 qatsar** — primitive root; "to dock off, i.e. curtail; especially to harvest (grass or grain)." KJV: cut down, discouraged, grieve, harvestman, lothe, mourn, reap(-er), shorten, straiten, trouble, vex. ~49× OT.
**H4038 maggal** — "a sickle." From unused root = to reap. Only 2× OT: Jer 50:16, Joel 3:13.
**G2326 therismos** — from G2325; "reaping, i.e. the crop." 13× NT.
**G2325 therizo** — from G2330 (theros=summer/heat); "to harvest." 21× NT.
**G1407 drepanon** — from drep- (to pluck); "a gathering hook (esp. for harvesting)." 8× NT (Mark 4:29 + 7× Rev 14).
**G2327 theristes** — from G2325; "a harvester." 2× NT (Matt 13:30,39).

## Etymology: HARVEST and THE END Share a Root

H7105 qatsir (harvest) derives from H7114 qatsar = to CUT/sever.
H7093 qets (THE END) derives from H7112 qatsats = to CUT OFF.
Both from the same semantic domain: **cutting**. Hebrew embeds the connection: the END IS a harvest — a cutting/severing. Matt 13:39 makes this explicit: "the harvest IS (estin) the end (synteleia G4930) of the age (aion G165)." Not metaphor — equation.

## Context Bag

**DEFINITIONAL — JESUS DEFINES HARVEST:** Matt 13:39 — harvest = synteleia of age. Reapers = angels. Field = world. Good seed = children of kingdom. Tares = children of wicked one (Matt 13:38). Enemy = devil. THIS IS THE INTERPRETIVE KEY. Harvest is not metaphor for judgment — it IS the appointed consummation where GRASS-types (wheat vs tares = people) are separated by their FRUIT.

**DUAL HARVEST — TWO CROPS, TWO OUTCOMES:** Rev 14:14-20 — First harvest (vv.14-16): Son of man on white cloud, golden crown, sharp sickle. Angel from temple: "harvest of earth is ripe (G3583 xeraino = dried/withered)." Earth reaped → grain gathered. Second harvest (vv.17-19): Another angel with sharp sickle. Angel from altar (fire-authority): "gather clusters of vine, grapes fully ripe (G187 akmazo)." Cast into "great winepress of wrath of God." v.20: blood to horse bridles, 1600 furlongs. GRAIN harvest → gathering (salvation). GRAPE harvest → winepress (wrath). Same field, same time, two outcomes. Parallels Exo 23:16 two feasts exactly.

**JOEL-REVELATION VERBATIM:** Joel 3:13 — "Put ye in the sickle (H4038), for the harvest (H7105) is ripe (H1310 bashal = boiled/cooked/ripened): come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great." Rev 14:15 — "Thrust in thy sickle (G1407), and reap (G2325): for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest (G2326) of the earth is ripe." Joel merges both harvests into one verse (sickle + press + wickedness); Revelation separates them into two sequential actions. Joel's H1310 bashal = "boiled/cooked" → ripeness as HEAT completion. Rev's G3583 xeraino (grain) = dried vs G187 akmazo (grape) = peak — different ripeness types for different crops.

**FEAST STRUCTURE — TWO HARVESTS CALENDARED:** Exo 23:16 — (1) "Feast of harvest (H7105), firstfruits of thy labours" = Feast of Weeks/Pentecost (Exo 34:22). Wheat harvest. Spring. (2) "Feast of ingathering (H614 asiph), in the end (H3318) of the year" = Sukkot/Tabernacles. Final grape/fruit. Autumn. Israel's liturgical calendar enacts the dual-harvest pattern: firstfruits (Pentecost) → final ingathering (Tabernacles). Acts 2 (Pentecost) = firstfruits of Spirit-harvest. Tabernacles = final ingathering yet future. The feasts ARE the harvest prophetically enacted.

**BABYLON'S HARVEST:** Jer 51:33 — "Daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come." Babylon has its OWN harvest — but it's Babylon being threshed, not Babylon harvesting. Jer 50:16 — "Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest." Sickle removed from Babylon → she cannot reap. Her harvest = her judgment.

**MISSED HARVEST — COVENANT FAILURE:** Jer 8:20 — "The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved." Harvest = window of salvation/gathering that can CLOSE. Once passed → too late. Not continuous — appointed season. Isa 17:11 — "the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief." Planted and tended, but harvest arrives as destruction — works were wrong kind.

**JUDAH'S APPOINTED HARVEST:** Hos 6:11 — "O Judah, he hath set a harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people." God SETS (H7896 shith = appoints/places) a harvest for Judah. Timed to return from captivity. Harvest = appointed gathering after exile.

**SOW-REAP PRINCIPLE — MORAL CAUSATION:** Gal 6:7-9 — "whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to flesh → reap corruption. He that soweth to Spirit → reap life everlasting. In due season we shall reap." Harvest is INEVITABLE consequence of sowing — but note "due season" (G2398 idios + G2540 kairos = own appointed-time). Delayed, not immediate. Hos 8:7 — "sown wind, reap whirlwind." Harvest AMPLIFIES what was sown. Hos 10:12-13 — "sow righteousness, reap mercy" vs "plowed wickedness, reaped iniquity." Prov 22:8 — "soweth iniquity, reap vanity." Jer 12:13 — "sown wheat, reap thorns" — even good seed in cursed ground → bad harvest. Job 4:8 — "plow iniquity, sow wickedness, reap the same."

**SPIRITUAL HARVEST — PEOPLE AS CROP:** Matt 9:37-38 — "harvest plenteous, laborers few. Pray the Lord of the harvest send forth laborers." Harvest = people ready to be gathered. John 4:35-38 — "fields white already to harvest." Reaper gathers fruit unto life eternal. "One soweth, another reapeth." Fields = people. White = ripe/ready. Luke 10:2 — same language repeated → laborers into "his harvest."

**KINGDOM GROWTH → HARVEST:** Mark 4:26-29 — Seed cast → blade → ear → full corn → "immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is come." Kingdom grows organically, THEN sickle. Harvest = appointed end of growth period. Not random — triggered by ripeness.

**RUTH GLEANING — ENACTED HARVEST:** Ruth 1:22-2:23 — Naomi+Ruth arrive at beginning of barley harvest. Ruth gleans among reapers of Boaz. She keeps fast through barley + wheat harvest. TYPES: Gentile (Moabitess) gleaning among Israel's harvest. Kinsman-redeemer (Boaz) permits her in. Marriage follows harvest. Pattern: harvest → gleaning of outsiders → covenant marriage → lineage of David → Christ.

**AGRICULTURAL LAW — GLEANING MANDATED:** Lev 19:9, 23:22 — "When ye reap harvest of your land, thou shalt NOT wholly reap corners... leave them for the poor and stranger." Harvest must leave a REMNANT for the vulnerable. God commands incomplete reaping → mercy within judgment. Not all is cut. Deut 24:19 — forgotten sheaf = blessing for stranger, fatherless, widow. Even in harvest-separation, provision for those outside the main gathering.

**WISDOM PATTERN — HARVEST AS ACCOUNTABILITY:** Prov 6:8 — ant gathers in harvest (wise preparation). Prov 10:5 — sleeping in harvest = shame. Prov 20:4 — sluggard doesn't plow → begs in harvest. Prov 25:13 — faithful messenger refreshing as cold snow in harvest. Harvest = the moment of ACCOUNTING when prior work (or laziness) is revealed.

## Candidate Meanings (7+)

1. **Literal agricultural gathering** — seasonal crop-cutting. REJECT: fails in prophetic/apocalyptic contexts (Rev 14, Joel 3). Too surface-level.
2. **Final Judgment** — the last day of reckoning. PARTIAL: captures Rev 14 and Matt 13 but misses John 4:35 (spiritual harvest during ministry), wisdom texts (seasonal accountability), and sow-reap principle (ongoing).
3. **Consequence of sowing** — you reap what you sow. PARTIAL: captures Gal 6, Hos 8:7, Prov 22:8 but misses the GATHERING/SEPARATION dimension and the appointed-time element.
4. **The end of the age** — identical to THE END. REJECT: Matt 13:39 says harvest IS the end, but harvest adds specificity THE END lacks: mechanism (cutting), process (gathering/separating), dual outcome (barn/winepress), ripeness prerequisite.
5. **Soul-winning / evangelism** — gathering people to God. PARTIAL: fits Matt 9:37, John 4:35, Luke 10:2 but fails completely in judgment contexts (Rev 14:17-20, Joel 3:13, Jer 51:33).
6. **Appointed separation when accumulated works reach fullness** — combines: (a) appointed timing (Jer 5:24 "appointed weeks of harvest"), (b) ripeness/fullness prerequisite (Joel 3:13, Rev 14:15,18), (c) cutting/severing (etymology), (d) dual outcome (grain→barn, grape→winepress), (e) inevitable consequence of sowing (Gal 6:7). BEST FIT: works in ALL contexts. Test below.
7. **Cyclical divine accountability** — recurring harvest-seasons of testing. PARTIAL: captures wisdom texts and agricultural law but too weak for apocalyptic finality of Rev 14.
8. **Ripeness of wickedness triggering judgment** — Joel 3:13 "wickedness is great," Rev 14:18 "grapes fully ripe." PARTIAL: only captures judgment side, misses salvation harvest (Rev 14:14-16, John 4:35-38).

## Substitution Test — Candidate 6

**Meaning: The appointed separation when accumulated works reach fullness and are gathered to their outcome.**

- Rev 14:15: "the [appointed separation] of the earth is ripe" ✓ — fullness reached, cutting begins
- Joel 3:13: "put in the sickle, the [appointed separation] is ripe; wickedness is great" ✓ — fullness of wickedness triggers separation
- Jer 8:20: "the [appointed separation] is past... we are not saved" ✓ — missed the gathering window
- Jer 51:33: "daughter of Babylon... time of her [appointed separation] shall come" ✓ — Babylon's accumulated works reach fullness for judgment
- John 4:35: "fields white already to [appointed gathering]" ✓ — people's readiness has reached fullness
- Matt 9:37: "the [gathering of the ripe] is plenteous, laborers few" ✓ — many ready to be gathered
- Gal 6:7-9: "whatsoever sows, shall reap... in due season [the appointed gathering of our works]" ✓ — consequence arrives at appointed time
- Hos 6:11: "he hath set an [appointed separation] for thee" ✓ — God appoints the gathering
- Lev 19:9: "when ye reap the [appointed gathering] of your land, not wholly reap corners" ✓ — even in separation, leave a remnant
- Prov 10:5: "sleepeth in [the time of appointed gathering] = shame" ✓ — accountability moment missed

Works across ALL context types: agricultural law, wisdom, prophetic, parabolic, apocalyptic, discourse.

## Structural Findings

**HARVEST = THE END ENACTED.** THE END (G5056 telos / G4930 synteleia) = covenant purpose reaching fulfillment (see the-end.md). HARVEST (G2326 / H7105) = the MECHANISM of that fulfillment — the cutting, gathering, separating that constitutes the end. Etymology confirms: both derive from "cutting" roots (H7114 qatsar → H7105 qatsir || H7112 qatsats → H7093 qets). Matt 13:39 is the equation: harvest = synteleia. Harvest adds to THE END: ripeness prerequisite, dual outcome, gathering process, role of reapers (angels).

**TWO HARVESTS = TWO FEASTS = TWO OUTCOMES.** (1) Grain harvest / Feast of Harvest-Weeks-Pentecost / Rev 14:14-16 = gathering of righteous (into barn, Matt 13:30). (2) Grape harvest / Feast of Ingathering-Tabernacles / Rev 14:17-20 = gathering for winepress of wrath. Same earth, same sickle instrument, different crops, different destinations. The duality is calendared in Torah, enacted in feasts, fulfilled in Revelation.

**RIPENESS = FULLNESS OF WORKS.** Harvest cannot occur before ripeness. Joel 3:13 — "harvest is ripe... wickedness is great." Rev 14:15 — "harvest of earth is ripe (G3583 dried/ready)." Rev 14:18 — "grapes fully ripe (G187 akmazo = at peak)." Ripeness = accumulated works reaching their fullness. God waits for fullness (Gen 15:16 "iniquity of Amorites not yet full"). Harvest is triggered by ripeness, not by arbitrary divine timing.

**SOW-REAP = CREATION PRINCIPLE.** Gen 8:22 places seedtime-harvest alongside cold-heat, summer-winter, day-night = irreversible creation ordinances. The sow→reap principle is as fixed as sunrise. Gal 6:7 "God is not mocked" — this law cannot be circumvented. What is sown WILL be reaped. The harvest WILL come. Only the timing is uncertain (Gal 6:9 "due season").

**AMPLIFICATION.** Hos 8:7 — "sown wind, reap WHIRLWIND." Harvest amplifies the sowing. 2Cor 9:6 — "soweth sparingly → reap sparingly; bountifully → bountifully." The return exceeds the investment, both positive and negative. This is why harvest is terrifying for the wicked and joyful for the righteous (Isa 9:3 "joy in harvest"; Ps 126:5 "sow in tears, reap in joy").

**GLEANING = MERCY WITHIN JUDGMENT.** Lev 19:9, 23:22 — corners and gleanings left for poor/stranger. Ruth = Gentile gleaner in Israel's harvest. Even in the separation-event, God mandates provision for those outside the main covenant community. Gleaning is the mercy-remainder in the judgment-harvest.

**JOEL 3:13 → REV 14:15 CHAIN.** Joel's "put in the sickle, harvest is ripe" is the OT template for Revelation's apocalyptic harvest. Joel merges grain+grape into one verse; Rev expands into two sequential harvests. Joel adds: "press is full, fats overflow, wickedness is great" — the fullness language. This is the clearest cross-testament harvest prophecy: both use sickle + ripe + harvest in identical structure.

**BABYLON AS THRESHINGFLOOR.** Jer 51:33 — Babylon = threshingfloor, her harvest SHALL COME. Jer 50:16 — sickle cut off FROM Babylon. Babylon's harvest is not her gathering others but her own threshing. Co-occurs with FALL OF BABYLON pattern. The harvest-of-Babylon = the appointed fullness of Babylon's wickedness → judgment.
