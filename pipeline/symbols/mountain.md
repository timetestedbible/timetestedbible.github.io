## Context Bag

**Definitional:** Rev 17:9 — seven heads ARE seven mountains → explicit angelic interpretation: MOUNTAIN = seat of power/kingdom. Dan 2:35,44-45 — stone BECOMES great mountain filling earth → God sets up kingdom never destroyed; mountain = visible established form of kingdom. Jer 51:25 — BABYLON directly called "destroying mountain" which destroys all earth → kingdom/power exercising dominion + BABYLON co-occurrence.

**Functional:** Mountains DO what governments do: (1) ESTABLISHED/EXALTED — Isa 2:2 "established in top of mountains, exalted above hills"; (2) Nations FLOW to them — Isa 2:2, Micah 4:1 → SEA/nations drawn to ruling authority; (3) LAW goes forth FROM them — Isa 2:3, Micah 4:2 "out of Zion shall go forth the law" → TRUTH co-occurrence; (4) God DWELLS there — Joel 3:17 "LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain" → JERUSALEM co-occurrence; (5) Exercise RULE over territory.

**Behavioral:** People go UP to mountains — Isa 2:3 "let us go up to the mountain of the LORD." Nations submit/flow to God's mountain. Mountains REMOVED by faith — Matt 17:20, Matt 21:21 "say unto this mountain, Be thou removed" → FAITH co-occurrence. Removing mountains = toppling governmental powers/obstacles by trusting obedience.

**Pattern:** Sinai → place God's law/government given || Zion → God's kingdom, seat of authority || Babylon as mountain → world kingdom opposing God || Seven mountains (Rev 17) → seven kingdoms/powers || Stone→mountain (Dan 2) → God's kingdom filling earth. Every case: mountain = seat of ruling authority.

**Antithetical:** Mountains contrast with valleys (low position, subjection), plains (no elevation, no authority), SEA (chaos, instability, peoples without government — Rev 17:15). Mountains "cast into sea" (Matt 21:21) → kingdoms thrown into chaos. Mountains "melt"/"moved" (Isa 54:10, Ps 46:2) → governments collapse.

**Christological:** Sermon on Mount → teaching with governmental AUTHORITY. Transfiguration on mountain → glory of His kingdom revealed. Temptation on mountain → devil shows "all kingdoms of world" FROM a mountain. Return to Mount of Olives → Zech 14:4 → establishing His kingdom. All tied to AUTHORITY + KINGDOM.

**Substitution test:** Rev 17:9 mountains→[kingdoms] ✓✓ | Dan 2:35 mountain→[kingdom] ✓✓ | Jer 51:25 mountain→[kingdom] ✓✓ | Isa 2:2 mountain→[government] ✓✓ | Matt 21:21 mountain→[ruling power] ✓ | Isa 2:3 mountain→[kingdom/authority] ✓.

**Dual application:** God's mountain (Zion = righteous government → JERUSALEM) || World's mountains (Babylon, seven mountains of Rev = worldly kingdoms → BABYLON). Symbol works for both divine + human governments — seats of power whether God's throne or earthly empires.
