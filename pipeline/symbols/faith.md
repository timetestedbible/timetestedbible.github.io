## Context Bag

**Definition**: Heb 11:1 — faith = G5287 hypostasis (assurance/confidence) of things hoped for + G1650 elegchos (proof/conviction) of things not seen. But definition incomplete without action component →

**Faith requires works**: James 2 chain — faith without works = dead (James 2:17, 2:20, 2:26) || "I will shew thee my faith BY my works" (James 2:18) || faith wrought WITH works, by works faith made perfect (James 2:22) || body without spirit = dead, so faith without works = dead (James 2:26). Demons "believe" one God (James 2:19) → mental assent ≠ saving faith. True faith → ACTION.

**Faith = obedience explicitly**: Rom 1:5 "obedience TO the faith" + Rom 16:26 "obedience OF faith" → faith's nature IS obedience; genitive construction = faith and obedience are inseparable.

**[H] Hebrew root**: אֱמוּנָה emunah (H530) in Hab 2:4 "the just shall live by his faith" → means faithfulness, steadfastness, firmness. Root אָמַן aman = to be firm, support, be faithful. Hebrew thought: faith = steadfast faithful action, not mental assent.

**Action pattern**: "Thy faith hath made thee whole" (Matt 9:22, Mark 5:34, Luke 8:48) — each person ACTED on belief: woman touched garment, centurion came to Jesus, blind man cried out + followed. Faith demonstrated BY action.

**Antithetical**: FAITH (obedience) vs. UNBELIEF (disobedience) — Heb 3:18-19 equates "believed not" with inability to enter rest || Heb 4:6 "entered not in because of unbelief." Israel's unbelief = disobedience = refusal to act on God's word. Unbelief and disobedience explicitly equated.

**Substitution test**: Hab 2:4 "live by his obedience" ✓ || Rom 1:5 "obedience to the [standard of] obedience" ✓ || James 2:17 "obedience without works is dead" — obedience IS works ✓ || Matt 9:22 "thy trusting obedience hath made thee whole" ✓ || Heb 11:1 "trusting obedience is assurance of things hoped for" ✓ || Eph 2:8 "by grace saved through trusting obedience" ✓

**Co-symbol web**: TRUTH (commandment/God's standard) = what we obey || FAITH (obedience) = our response to TRUTH || LIGHT (visible example) = faith produces visible obedience. "Doing truth" (keeping commandments) = ACTION of faith. FRUIT + OIL = works/deeds = output of faith.

**Core logic chain**: God speaks (TRUTH/BREAD) → faith receives + acts (obedience) → produces visible FRUIT/LIGHT → absence of action = unbelief = disobedience = death.
