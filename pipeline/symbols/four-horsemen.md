ROSETTA STONE: Zech 6:5 angel decode: chariots+horses = "four spirits (H7307) of heavens...from standing before Lord of all earth" → horsemen = winds = spirits = God's executing agents

THREE ZECHARIAH VISIONS = ONE ENTITY:
Zech 1:8-11: red horse + red/speckled/white reconnaissance → "sent to walk to and fro through earth" → report: "earth sitteth still at rest" → triggers "How long?" (false peace phase)
Zech 6:1-8: four chariots from two brass mountains → red/black/white/grisled-bay → "four spirits of heavens" → dispatch north/south → "quieted my spirit in north country" (execution phase)
Rev 6:1-8: Lamb opens seals → four living creatures command "Come!" → white/red/black/pale sequential release → conquest/war/famine/death (judgment unleashed)

COLOR ANALYSIS: Same set, different order
Zech 6: red→black→white→grisled-bay (war first)
Rev 6: white→red→black→pale (deception first, matching Mat 24:4-5)
H122/G4450 = burning-red from fire imagery || G5515 chloros = sickly-green death color

EZEK 14:21 TETRAD MATCH: "four sore judgments: SWORD + FAMINE + NOISOME BEAST + PESTILENCE" = Rev 6:8 "kill with sword + hunger + death + beasts"
Four horsemen execute four covenant curses || Horseman 4 summarizes all four judgments

MECHANISM: SEALING PRECONDITION → RESTRAINT → RELEASE
Rev 7:1-3: four angels "holding four winds of the earth, that wind should NOT blow on earth, sea, or any TREE, TILL we have sealed servants of God in their foreheads"
The four winds/horsemen CANNOT harm any tree (nation) or grass (person) UNTIL the sealing is complete
This is not simultaneous — it is SEQUENTIAL: seal servants FIRST → THEN release winds/horsemen
The sealing is the PRECONDITION for the birth pains to begin, not just protection during them
Rev 6: seals on scroll opened → horsemen released sequentially AFTER servants sealed
Inverse operations: protection seals applied BEFORE judgment seals opened

"WALK TO AND FRO" MISSION:
Zech 1:10-11 + Zech 6:7 colored horses share phrase with Job 1:7 Satan → same patrol commission
All operate from throne room presence ("standing before Lord" || "present themselves before LORD")
Spirits = God's executing agents under divine governance, not arbitrary evil

PS 104:4 → angels = spirits (H7307) = winds || four horsemen/chariots/spirits = angelic executing forces
Four living creatures (Rev 4-6) = throne authorities dispatching agents via "Come!" commands

TWO BRASS MOUNTAINS (Zech 6:1): H5178 nechosheth = judgment metal → spirits emerge from covenant judgment apparatus
Possibly Sinai (law) + Zion (throne) || or temple pillars Jachin+Boaz framework

DAN 7:2-3: "four winds strove upon great sea → four beasts came up" → four spirits create/destroy empires
Four horsemen = MECHANISM producing beast-kingdoms through conquest/war/famine/death cycles

MAT 24:4-8 STRUCTURAL PARALLEL:
24:4-5 false Christs/deception → Seal 1 white horse/bow/crown/conquest
24:6 wars/rumors → Seal 2 red horse/sword/takes peace  
24:7b famines → Seal 3 black horse/balances/famine pricing
24:7c pestilences+earthquakes → Seal 4 pale horse/death tetrad
Jesus discourse = John's vision || both derive from Ezek→Zech tradition

WHITE HORSE PROBLEM: Rev 6:2 vs Rev 19:11
6:2: bow (G5115 toxon, distance weapon) + given crown (stephanos, delegated) + conquering → deception-at-range
19:11: sword from mouth + inherent authority + "Faithful and True" → genuine Christ
First horseman = counterfeit white-horse riders (Mat 24:5 "come in my name")

FOUR = TOTALITY: four corners/winds/directions = complete earth coverage
"Fourth part of earth" (Rev 6:8) = quartile division || each horseman operates domain of whole

CROSS-TESTAMENT CHAIN: Ezek 14:21 four judgments → Zech 1+6 four spirits → Mat 24:4-8 birth pains → Rev 6:1-8 four seals → Rev 7:1-3 four winds held
Unbroken prophetic sequence: same agents, functions, origin, covenant-judgment purpose

PATTERN SUMMARY:
Four = totality || Horses/chariots/winds/spirits = same entities || Colors encode function types || Mission = earth patrol+judgment execution || Source = throne room || Target = covenant curses || Mechanism = restraint/release || Tradition = Ezek→Zech→Jesus→John
