## Context Bag

### ROSETTA STONE: ZECHARIAH 6:5

Angel interprets four chariots with colored horses: "These are the four SPIRITS (H7307 ruach) of the heavens, which go forth from standing before (H3320 yatsab) the Lord (H113 adon) of all the earth." Direct angelic decode: horses+chariots = spirits/winds. Same H7307 used for "four winds" everywhere (Jer 49:36, Zech 2:6, Ezek 37:9, Dan 7:2). **Four horsemen = four winds = four spirits = God's executing agents.**

### THREE ZECHARIAH VISIONS — ONE ENTITY

**Zech 1:8-11 (1st vision):** Man on RED horse (H122+H5483) standing among myrtle trees in the hollow/shade. Behind him: red, speckled (H8320 saruq = bright-red/bay), white (H3836). "These are they whom the LORD hath SENT (H7971 shalach) to walk to and fro (H1980 halak) through the earth." Report: "all the earth sitteth still and is at rest (H8252 shaqat)." → Reconnaissance mission; earth at false peace; triggers "How long?" (1:12).

**Zech 6:1-8 (8th vision):** Four CHARIOTS (H4818 merkabah) from between two MOUNTAINS of BRASS (H5178 nechosheth). Chariot 1: red (H122) horses. Chariot 2: black (H7838 shachor). Chariot 3: white (H3836 laban). Chariot 4: grisled (H1261 barod = spotted-as-hail) + bay (H554 amots = strong/red). Angel: "four spirits of the heavens." Black→north country. White→after them (north). Grisled→south. Bay→"walk to and fro through the earth" (SAME PHRASE as 1:10). Result: "quieted my spirit (H7307) in the north country" (6:8). → Execution mission; spirits dispatched for judgment.

**Rev 6:1-8 (four seals):** Lamb opens seals → four living creatures (G2226 zoon) say "Come!" → four horses released sequentially. Horse 1: white (G3022 leukos), rider has bow (G5115 toxon), crown (G4735 stephanos), conquering. Horse 2: red (G4450 pyrrhos = fire-colored), takes peace, great sword (G3162 machaira). Horse 3: black (G3189 melas), balances (G2218 zugos = yoke/scales), famine pricing. Horse 4: pale (G5515 chloros = greenish/sickly), rider named Death (G2288 thanatos), Hades (G86) follows; kills with sword (G4501 rhomphaia) + hunger (G3042 limos) + death (thanatos = pestilence per LXX deber→thanatos) + beasts (G2342 therion). → Judgment execution; four covenant curses unleashed.

### COLOR ANALYSIS

| # | Zech 6 | Rev 6 | Zech 1 | Function |
|---|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Red H122 | White G3022 | Red H122 | Conquest/deception |
| 2 | Black H7838 | Red G4450 | Speckled H8320 | War/bloodshed |
| 3 | White H3836 | Black G3189 | White H3836 | Famine/scarcity |
| 4 | Grisled+Bay H1261+H554 | Pale/green G5515 | — | Death/pestilence |

Colors appear in different ORDER but same SET (red, black, white, mixed/pale). Order difference is significant: Zech 6 begins with red (war first); Rev 6 begins with white (deception first → Mat 24:4-5 "take heed that no man DECEIVE you" = FIRST warning). The reordering matches Jesus's sequencing exactly.

**Key color notes:** G4450 pyrrhos (Rev 6:4) = "fire-like" from G4442 pyr (fire). Not merely "red" but BURNING red. H554 amots = "of a strong color" from H553 amats (to be strong). H1261 barod = "spotted as if with hail" from H1258 barad (hail) — judgment imagery baked into the color word. G5515 chloros = "greenish/verdant/dun" — same word for green grass (Rev 8:7, Mark 6:39); on a horse = sickly/corpse-like.

### FUNCTION: EZEKIEL 14:21 TETRAD

"My FOUR sore judgments (H8201 shephet) upon Jerusalem: SWORD (H2719), FAMINE (H7458), NOISOME BEAST (H2416 chay ra'ah), PESTILENCE (H1698)."

Rev 6:8 matches EXACTLY: "kill with SWORD (G4501), HUNGER (G3042), DEATH (G2288 = LXX of H1698 deber), BEASTS (G2342) of the earth."

The fourth horseman SUMMARIZES all four judgments — or, the four horsemen collectively execute the four judgments of Ezek 14:21:
- Horseman 1 (white/conquest) → deception that CAUSES the other three
- Horseman 2 (red/war) → SWORD
- Horseman 3 (black/famine) → FAMINE
- Horseman 4 (pale/death) → PESTILENCE + BEASTS (compound judgment)

### MECHANISM: HELD BACK → RELEASED

**Rev 6:** Lamb opens seals → horsemen released ONE BY ONE. Each living creature commands "Come!" Seals = restraining mechanism. Opening = releasing.

**Rev 7:1-3:** "Four angels standing on the four corners (G1137 gonia) of the earth, HOLDING (G2902 krateo = seize/retain forcefully) the four winds (G417 anemos) of the earth, that the wind should NOT blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree." Angel from east: "HURT NOT the earth...till we have SEALED (G4972 sphragizo) the servants."

Same mechanism in both: restraint → release. Rev 7 shows the HOLDING; Rev 6 shows the RELEASING. The seals ON THE SCROLL (Rev 5-6) correspond to the sealing OF THE SERVANTS (Rev 7:3) — both use G4973 sphragis / G4972 sphragizo. Opening one set of seals releases judgment; completing the other set of seals protects the faithful. Simultaneous inverse operations.

### "WALK TO AND FRO" — THE MISSION PHRASE

Three entities share this exact commission:
1. **Zech 1:10-11** — colored horses: "whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro (H1980 halak) through the earth"
2. **Zech 6:7** — bay horses: "sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth...So they walked to and fro through the earth"
3. **Job 1:7** — Satan: "From going to and fro (H7751 shut) in the earth, and from walking up and down (H1980 halak) in it"

The four spirits patrol the earth as agents of divine governance. The Satan also patrols — but under permission (Job 1:12). Both operate from the throne room ("present themselves before the LORD" Job 1:6; "standing before the Lord" Zech 6:5). The spirits are not inherently demonic — they are God's executing agents. Their effects (war, famine, death) are COVENANT CURSES, not arbitrary evil.

### PS 104:4 — ANGELS = SPIRITS = WINDS

"Who maketh his angels spirits (H7307 ruach); his ministers a flaming fire." Quoted Heb 1:7. Angels ARE winds/spirits. The four horsemen/chariots/spirits are angelic executing forces. The four living creatures (zoon) of Rev 4-6 who command "Come!" are the throne-room authorities dispatching these agents.

### TWO MOUNTAINS OF BRASS (ZECH 6:1)

Chariots emerge "from between two mountains of BRASS (H5178 nechosheth)." Brass/bronze = judgment metal throughout Scripture: brazen altar (Exod 27:2), brazen serpent (Num 21:9), feet like burnished brass (Rev 1:15, Dan 10:6). Two mountains = two pillars of covenant judgment. Possibly: Sinai (law-giving) + Zion (throne) — the two covenant mountains between which God's executing agents operate. Or: the two bronze pillars Jachin ("He establishes") and Boaz ("In Him is strength") flanking the temple (1 Kgs 7:21) — the spirits emerge from God's temple-judgment apparatus.

### DANIEL 7:2-3 — WINDS → BEASTS

"Four winds of heaven strove upon the great SEA. And four great BEASTS came up from the sea." The four spirits/winds STIR the sea (nations/peoples) → kingdoms rise. The four horsemen are the MECHANISM producing the four beast-kingdoms: conquest, war, famine, death ARE the forces that create and destroy empires. Dan 8:8: Alexander's empire "toward the four winds of heaven" = divided along the same four-directional pattern.

### MAT 24:4-8 STRUCTURAL PARALLEL

Jesus's birth-pains sequence maps to the four horsemen:
1. **Mat 24:4-5** (false Christs/deception) → **Seal 1** (white horse, bow, crown, conquest)
2. **Mat 24:6** (wars and rumors of wars) → **Seal 2** (red horse, takes peace, great sword)
3. **Mat 24:7b** (famines) → **Seal 3** (black horse, balances, famine pricing)
4. **Mat 24:7c** (pestilences + earthquakes) → **Seal 4** (pale horse, death by sword+hunger+pestilence+beasts)

Jesus gives the SAME sequence in plain discourse that John sees in apocalyptic vision. Both derive from Ezekiel's four judgments (14:21) and Zechariah's four spirits (6:5). The tradition is continuous: Ezek → Zech → Jesus (Mat 24) → John (Rev 6).

### THE WHITE HORSE PROBLEM

Tradition splits on horseman 1: (a) Christ/gospel conquering or (b) conquest/deception. Evidence for (b): the parallel structure demands it — Mat 24:4-5 places DECEPTION first, and Jesus's first concern. The white horse of Rev 19:11 (explicitly Christ) has different attributes: called Faithful and True, judges in righteousness, has a SWORD from his mouth, eyes as fire. Rev 6:2 has a BOW (G5115 toxon — only occurrence in NT; elsewhere bow = distant weapon, deception at range), a stephanos crown (given, not inherent), and goes forth "conquering" (G3528 nikao). The stephanos is GIVEN (G1325 didomi passive) — authority delegated, not inherent. This is conquest-by-deception: appearing righteous (white) while operating through delegation, distance, and false authority. Fits Mat 24:5 "many shall come IN MY NAME" = counterfeit white-horse riders.

### FOUR AS TOTALITY

Number FOUR = whole earth (four corners Rev 7:1/20:8, four winds, four directions). Four horsemen = TOTAL coverage of earth. Four judgments of Ezek 14:21 = God's COMPLETE judgment toolkit. Not partial — exhaustive. The "fourth part of the earth" (Rev 6:8) given to the pale horse may indicate a quartile division: each horseman operates over a domain of the whole.

### CROSS-TESTAMENT CHAIN

Ezek 14:21 (four judgments) → Zech 1:8-11 (four horse-colors, patrol) → Zech 6:1-8 (four chariots = four spirits, dispatched from throne) → Mat 24:4-8 (four-element birth pains) → Rev 6:1-8 (four seals = four horsemen released) → Rev 7:1-3 (four winds held by four angels until sealing). Unbroken prophetic chain: same four agents, same four functions, same divine origin, same covenant-judgment purpose.
