## Context Bag

**LEXICAL CHAIN:** G3709 orgé = from G3713 oregomai (to stretch/reach); properly desire, then violent passion, judicial punishment. Settled, deliberate response. G2372 thymós = from G2380 thyō (to rush/breathe hard); passion, boiling fury, fierceness. Immediate, explosive. H639 aph = nose/nostril → face → anger (from rapid breathing). Anthropomorphic: God's "nose burns hot." H2534 chemah = heat/poison/fury, from H3179 yacham (to be hot). Literal heat → figurative rage. Also: venom of serpents (Deut 32:33, Ps 58:4, 140:3).

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION — orgé vs thymós:** Rev 14:10 "wine of G2372 thymós poured into cup of G3709 orgé" — thymós IS the content, orgé IS the container. Thymós = the burning fury; orgé = the judicial sentence that holds it. Rev 16:19 + 19:15 pair them: "fierceness G2372 of his wrath G3709." NOT synonyms — two phases of one action.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION — WRATH vs TRIBULATION:** G2347 thlipsis (tribulation/pressure) ≠ G3709 orgé (wrath). Saints HAVE thlipsis (John 16:33, Rev 7:14). Saints NOT appointed to orgé (1Thess 5:9). Tribulation REFINES covenant-keepers. Wrath DESTROYS covenant-breakers. Same fire, different material (→ FIRE study). Rev 7:14 great tribulation → washed robes. Rev 15:1 wrath filled up → plagues on rebels.

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**
1Thess 5:9 — "God hath NOT appointed G5087 us to G3709 wrath but to obtain G4991 salvation." DEFINING: covenant people excluded from wrath by design. co: SALVATION, THIEF_IN_NIGHT (v2-4).
1Thess 1:10 — "Jesus which G4506 delivered us from the G3709 wrath to come G2064." Present-tense deliverance from future wrath.
Rom 5:9 — "justified by blood → saved from G3709 wrath THROUGH him." Blood = mechanism of wrath-exemption.
Rom 1:18 — "G3709 wrath of God G601 revealed from heaven against all G763 ungodliness." Present, ongoing revelation. co: WICKEDNESS, TRUTH.
Rom 2:5 — "treasurest up G3709 wrath against day of G3709 wrath." Wrath ACCUMULATES. Specific DAY of release.
Rom 9:22 — "vessels of G3709 wrath fitted to G684 destruction" endured with longsuffering. co: PATIENCE → wrath delayed ≠ wrath cancelled.
Eph 5:6 — G3709 wrath comes on children of G543 disobedience. co: DECEIVE (v6a).
Rev 6:16-17 — "G3709 wrath of the G721 LAMB." Paradox: lambs don't rage. Slain one becomes judge. "Great day of his wrath is come." co: LAMB, THRONE, MOUNTAIN. 
Rev 14:10 — wine of G2372 thymós of God, unmixed G194, in cup of G3709 orgé. Torment with FIRE + BRIMSTONE before LAMB. co: WINE, FIRE, BRIMSTONE, LAMB.
Rev 15:1 — seven last G4127 plagues = G2372 thymós filled up G5055. WRATH HAS A MEASURE: it fills, then pours. co: PLAGUE.
Rev 15:7 — seven golden G5357 vials full of G2372 thymós. co: GOLD (refined containment).
Rev 16:1 — "pour out G5357 vials of G2372 thymós upon earth." Seven-fold structured release.
Rev 16:19 — Babylon remembered → cup of wine of G2372 fierceness of G3709 wrath. co: FALL_OF_BABYLON, WINE, CUP.
Rev 19:15 — Christ treads winepress of G2372 + G3709 of Almighty. co: WINE, SWORD, RETURN_OF_CHRIST.

**OT WRATH PATTERN:**
H639 "anger of the LORD kindled" = formulaic: Num 11:1, 11:33, 12:9, 25:3, 32:10-13, Exod 4:14, 32:10. Trigger: covenant violation. Duration: bounded by intercession (Exod 32:11-12, Num 14:18, Ps 78:38, 106:23). Exod 34:6 "slow of H639 anger" = long-nosed, slow to breathe hard.
H2534 chemah + H639 aph paired: Deut 9:19, 29:23,28. Fury + anger = hot + judicial.
Isa 51:17,20 — Jerusalem DRANK cup of H2534 fury. Already fulfilled in Exile. Same cup imagery → Rev 16:19 Babylon.

**WRATH-FILLING PATTERN:** Wrath has a MEASURE that fills over time: 1Thess 2:16 "fill up sins always, wrath come upon them to the uttermost G5056 telos." Gen 15:16 "iniquity of Amorites not yet full." Rev 15:1 wrath "filled up." Dan 8:23 "transgressors come to the full." Wrath is not capricious — it is the COMPLETION of a judicial process.

**PATTERN:** Wrath = covenant curse at full measure. Not random anger but judicial sentence executed when iniquity fills. Saints exempted by blood (Rom 5:9), delivered (1Thess 1:10), not appointed (1Thess 5:9). Wrath poured ON Babylon (Rev 16:19), not on Lamb's people. Tribulation ≠ wrath: one refines, the other destroys. The Lamb who was slain IS the one whose wrath falls — sacrifice rejected becomes judgment executed.
