## Context Bag

**IS → NATION / PEOPLE GROUP.** Explicit definitions: Isa 5:7 vineyard/plant = house of ISRAEL (nation); Dan 4:20-22 great tree = NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S KINGDOM (BABYLON); Ezek 31:3 cedar = ASSYRIA, Ezek 31:6 shadow → great nations, Ezek 31:18 = PHARAOH/EGYPT; Rom 11:17-24 olive tree = ISRAEL (covenant community); Hos 10:1 vine = ISRAEL. Flexible scale: God's nation || foreign nations || great empires || small communities.

**DOES → BEARS FRUIT / SHELTERS / PRODUCES.** (1) Bears FRUIT → nations produce works/results from character. Hos 10:1 Israel = empty vine bringing forth FRUIT + self. Matt 7:17 good tree → good FRUIT. (2) Provides shelter/shadow → protection for those within borders. Ezek 31:6 under shadow dwelt great nations. Dan 4:12 beasts had shadow under it (ANIMAL + TREE co-occurrence). (3) Can be CUT DOWN → judgment. Dan 4:23 hew tree down, destroy. Matt 7:19 tree not bearing good FRUIT → hewn down, cast into fire.

**COMPONENTS:** Root → foundation/origin (patriarchs, covenant) Rom 11:16-18. Branches → members/people of nation, Rom 11:17-21; natural branches = native Israel/Judah (can be broken off), wild branches = Gentiles (can be grafted in). FRUIT → works/deeds produced. Shadow → protection/shelter. Leaves → outward appearance/prosperity Dan 4:12.

**TREE STATES:** Great tree → great empire (Dan 4, Ezek 31). Small tree → smaller nation. Fruitful → righteous nation + good works. Barren → unfruitful nation. Green → flourishing, blessed. Dry → withered, cursed, ready for judgment. Opposite: cut down / dry tree = judged nation.

**SPECIFIC TYPES:** Olive tree → Israel (Rom 11). Vine/vineyard → Israel (Isa 5:7, Hos 10:1, John 15). Cedar → great empires—Assyria, Lebanon (Ezek 31). Fig tree → Israel (covenant status association).

**SYMBOL RELATIONSHIPS:** MOUNTAIN (kingdom/ruling authority) — trees grow ON mountains → nations under kingdoms. TREE (nation) = collective body. ANIMAL (people/tribe) — dwells under/within tree. SEA (chaotic unsanctified nations) || TREE (cultivated, ordered nation). THORNS → cursed FRUIT, what bad trees produce. BABYLON → subj: Dan 4:20-22 great tree explicitly = Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. FRUIT → works/deeds = output of tree's character. GRASS → mortal people || tree = collective national entity.

**LOGIC CHAIN:** Scripture explicitly defines trees as nations (Isa 5:7, Dan 4:22, Ezek 31:3-18, Rom 11:17-24, Hos 10:1). Size/type of tree → scale/character of nation. What matters most → FRUIT produced (Matt 7:17, Matt 7:19). Nations judged by fruit → cut down if barren/wicked.
