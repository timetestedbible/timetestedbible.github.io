## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**H2635 chasaph** (Aramaic) — clay/pottery. Dan 2 specific. ~9 occurrences in Daniel only.
**H2563 chomer** — clay, mire, mortar, heap. Also = HOMER (dry measure). From H2560 chamar = to ferment, boil, be red.
**H4568 ma'abeh** — thick clay (Hab 2:6 — Babylon loads itself with thick clay/pledges!)
**G4081 pelos** — clay. John 9:6,11,14-15 — Jesus makes clay, heals blind man. The CREATOR working with clay.
**G2766 keramos / G4074 pottery** — earthenware vessels.

**KEY THREADS TO TRACE:**
- Dan 2:33,41-43 — feet of iron mixed with CLAY. "Partly strong, partly broken." "They shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave" = CANNOT UNITE. Clay = the weak, brittle, human element that prevents the last Babylon from cohering.
- Gen 2:7 — man formed from dust/ground (H127 adamah). Clay = human origin material. Man IS clay.
- Isa 64:8 — "we are the clay, thou art the potter." Clay = PEOPLE. God shapes people.
- Jer 18:1-6 — potter's house: marred vessel re-formed. Clay = Israel/nations in God's hands.
- Rom 9:21 — potter's right over clay: vessels of honor vs dishonor. Clay = humanity under divine sovereignty.
- Job 10:9 — "thou hast made me as the clay; wilt thou bring me into dust again?" Clay→dust→death cycle.
- Hab 2:6 — Babylon loads itself with "thick clay" (H4568 = pledges/debts). Connected to Hab 2:7-8 creditors!
- 2Cor 4:7 — "treasure in earthen vessels" (G3749 ostrakinos = baked clay). Spirit in clay = divine in human.

**CRITICAL CONNECTION:** If CLAY = people/humanity and IRON = crushing military force, then Dan 2:43 "iron mixed with clay, shall not cleave" = military power mixed with populace that won't unify. The feet = alliance of force + people that fractures. G7/NATO = iron military framework mixed with diverse populations that "shall not cleave."

**HAB 2:6 CONNECTION:** "Woe to him that loadeth himself with thick CLAY" (H4568). Same Habakkuk oracle about Babylon's creditors (Hab 2:7-8). Thick clay = DEBT/PLEDGES. Babylon loads itself with debt = the very thing that its creditors use to destroy it. Clay in the feet = the debt that makes Babylon brittle.

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive search of H2635 + H2563 + H4568 + G4081. 7+ candidates. Potter metaphor chain (Isa 29:16, 45:9, Jer 18-19, Rom 9:20-21). Clay as human origin (Gen 2:7). Clay as debt (Hab 2:6). Production chain: earth/dust → wet → shaped → fired → pottery (but in Dan 2 the clay is NOT fired — it's MIRY, unfired, weak).
