## Context Bag

**Definitional anchor**: Deut 8:3 — physical bread sustains body || Word from God's mouth sustains true life. Jesus quotes this first under temptation (Matt 4:4). BREAD → WORD OF GOD explicitly.

**Manna = Torah test**: Exod 16:4 — bread rained from heaven to "prove them, whether they will walk in my torah (H8451)." Gather right amount, rest on Sabbath → manna = tangible Torah lesson; obedience test.

**Jesus = Bread of Life**: John 6:35, 6:48, 6:51 — "I am the living bread from heaven." Meaning decoded in John 6:63 — "the words I speak are spirit and life." Flesh profiteth nothing → eating His flesh = consuming His words. Connects to John 1:1 (Word = God) + John 1:14 (Word made flesh). Jesus = Torah incarnate; eating bread = receiving His instruction.

**Labour**: John 6:27 — labour not for perishing meat but enduring meat → physical bread perishes; Word endures forever.

**Shewbread / Bread of Presence**: Exod 25:30 — bread before God continually → God's Word always available. 1Chr 9:32 — prepared every Sabbath → day of rest + hearing God's Word.

**Breaking bread = cutting covenant**: Heb. כָּרַת בְּרִית (*karat berit*) = "cut a covenant" (Gen 15:9-18). If BREAD = Word/covenant terms → CUTTING BREAD = ENTERING COVENANT. Last Supper: Jesus breaks bread + says "new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20). Participants eat = accept terms. Parallels Sinai: covenant ratified w/ blood (Exod 24:8), then elders "saw God and did eat and drink" (Exod 24:11) → meal = covenant ceremony. Acts 2:42, 2:46 — believers "breaking bread" = renewing covenant around God's Word. Apostles' doctrine + breaking bread listed together → receiving terms + ratifying them.

**Famine = opposite**: Amos 8:11 — famine not of bread but of "hearing the words of the LORD." No bread → no Word → spiritual starvation.

**Unleavened bread** (H4682 matzah): leaven removed = sin/false doctrine removed. Matt 16:6 — "beware leaven of Pharisees." Matt 16:12 — disciples understood leaven = doctrine of Pharisees/Sadducees. LEAVEN = false doctrine; UNLEAVENED BREAD = pure Word without man's additions.

**Chain**: Physical bread → manna (Torah test, Exod 16:4) → Word from God's mouth (Deut 8:3) → Jesus/Bread of Life (John 6:35 + John 1:14) → His words = spirit + life (John 6:63). BREAD = WORD OF GOD = Torah/covenant terms.

**Co-occurring symbols**: WINE + BREAD in covenant meal (Luke 22:20); ROCK (covenant) subj: covenant ratification context; THE WAY (Torah) subj: manna as Torah test; MARRIAGE (covenant picture) || breaking bread = covenant ceremony; TRUTH (commandment) || Word from God's mouth; MARK (observance) || Sabbath shewbread pattern.
