## Context Bag

TWO APPROACHES → SAME CONCLUSION: NAME = COVENANT.

**Approach A: Paradox Resolution.**
Paradox 1 (Abraham Contradiction): Exod6:3 says YHWH "by my name YHWH was not known" to patriarchs, yet YHWH was spoken to Abraham (Gen15:7, Gen18:14, Gen22:16). Resolution: NAME ≠ pronunciation/word → NAME = something deeper. Paradox 2 ("Lord, Lord" Problem): Matt7:22-23 — people invoke "thy name," perform miracles, yet rejected as "workers of WICKEDNESS+lawlessness." Resolution: NAME → LAW/OBEDIENCE/COVENANT, not spoken words.

**Explicit Equation: NAME = ARK = COVENANT.**
2Sam7:2 — David wants house for "the ark of God." 2Sam7:13 — God responds: "He shall build a house for My NAME." God substitutes NAME for ARK [of the covenant] → NAME = COVENANT. Solomon's prayer (1Kgs8): "the NAME" appears 16× — every instance in COVENANT context: forgiveness, repentance, restoration. Confirms NAME = COVENANT.

**Approach B: Pattern-Based.**
Strong's: H8034 (שֵׁם) = honor, authority, character. G3686 (ὄνομα) = authority, character. Authority derives from RELATIONSHIP → specifically COVENANT. Key patterns: "In the NAME" = invoking covenant authority. "For his NAME's sake" = covenant obligation. "Baptized in the NAME" = entering covenant || MARRIAGE+. "No other NAME" = no other covenant for salvation. Relationship Test: when symbol involves invoking, ask what relationship is invoked → COVENANT.

**Convergence:** Both approaches independently → NAME = COVENANT.

**Proof Texts.**
Acts4:12 — "none other NAME whereby we must be saved" → no other COVENANT. 2Sam7:13 — NAME = ARK of COVENANT || ROCK+. Matt7:22-23 — "in thy NAME… workers of lawlessness" → NAME requires covenant-keeping; WICKEDNESS+ || THE WAY+. Deut28:58 — "do all the words of this law… fear this NAME" → Torah connected to NAME; BREAD+ || THE WAY+.

**Third Commandment Reframe.**
Exod20:7 — "Thou shalt not take the NAME of YHWH thy God in vain." If NAME = COVENANT: "taking the name in vain" = making the covenant nothing → not about pronunciation but living as if covenant doesn't matter. Matt7:23 "workers of lawlessness" = those who took His NAME in vain → WICKEDNESS+ || MARK+ (visible practice of disregard).

**Summary Chain:**
NAME → COVENANT. Invoke NAME → appeal to covenant. Profane NAME → dishonor covenant. BELIEVE+ on NAME → trust/obey covenant || FAITH+. "No other NAME" → no other COVENANT for salvation. Third Commandment → covenant faithfulness, not pronunciation guard.
