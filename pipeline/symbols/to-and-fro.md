## Context Bag

**LEXICAL ROOT:** H7751 shuwt שׁוּט = primitive root: "push forth." Figurative only in OT: lash (sea with oars) → row; by implication → travel/traverse. H7752 showt שׁוֹט = derivative noun: "a lash" → scourge, whip. The noun reveals the verb's kinetic shape: to-and-fro IS the back-and-forth stroke of a whip. Root family encodes restless, repetitive, sweeping motion — never arrival.

**H7751 OCCURRENCES (13 verses, 5 semantic clusters):**

**Cluster 1 — Satan's patrol:** Job 1:7, 2:2 — subj: Satan. "From going to and fro (H7751) in the earth and walking up and down (H1980) in it." Paired verbs: H7751 (lashing/traversing) + H1980 (walking). co: EARTH. Satan as restless agent with no covenant territory. Parallels raven (Gen 8:7) — never returns to ark.

**Cluster 2 — God's omniscient sweep:** 2Chr 16:9, Zech 4:10 — subj: eyes of LORD. "Run to and fro (H7751) through the whole earth." Same verb as Satan but different agent. God's eyes traverse all earth actively seeking. co: EYES, EARTH. Satan patrols to devour; God patrols to strengthen. Same motion, opposite purpose.

**Cluster 3 — End-times search:** Dan 12:4 — "many shall run to and fro (H7751), knowledge increased." Sealed until time of end. Amos 8:12 — "run to and fro (H7751) to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it." Two end-times searchings: Dan = knowledge found; Amos = word NOT found. Famine of hearing (Amos 8:11) drives fruitless to-and-fro. co: KNOWLEDGE, WORD, FAMINE.

**Cluster 4 — Desperate urban search:** Jer 5:1 — "Run ye to and fro (H7751) through streets of Jerusalem" seeking one righteous man. Jer 49:3 — "run to and fro (H7751) by the hedges" = Rabbah's daughters in flight from judgment. co: JERUSALEM, JUDGMENT.

**Cluster 5 — Maritime/commercial navigation:** Ezek 27:8 — inhabitants of Zidon = thy "mariners" (H7751). Ezek 27:26 — thy "rowers" (H7751) brought thee into great waters; east wind broke thee. Tyre's commercial agents row/traverse seas. co: TYRE, SEA, WIND, EAST. Num 11:8 — people "went about" (H7751) gathering manna. 2Sam 24:2,8 — Joab "went through" (H7751) all Israel numbering. Traversal for gathering/surveying.

**H7752 SHOT (SCOURGE/WHIP) — derivative noun, 11 occurrences:**
1Ki 12:11,14 / 2Chr 10:11,14 — Rehoboam: "my father chastised you with whips (H7752), I with scorpions." Job 5:21 — hid from scourge (H7752) of tongue. Job 9:23 — if scourge (H7752) slay suddenly, he laughs at trial of innocent. Prov 26:3 — whip (H7752) for horse. Isa 10:26 — LORD stirs up scourge (H7752) against Assyria. Isa 28:15,18 — "overflowing scourge (H7752) shall pass through" = covenant-with-death broken. Nah 3:2 — noise of whip (H7752) = Nineveh's chariot warfare. The to-and-fro motion IS a whipping: same root, same back-and-forth stroke.

**"TO AND FRO" WITH OTHER HEBREW WORDS (conceptual parallels):**
Gen 8:7 — raven goes forth (H3318 yatsa) to and fro (H7725 shub) = "going-out-and-returning." NOT H7751 but identical concept. Raven = first to-and-fro agent in Scripture. Never returns to ark → prototype of restless Satan-pattern (Job 1:7). Zech 1:10-11, 6:7 — angelic patrols "walk to and fro" (H1980 halak) through earth → same mission as God's eyes (2Chr 16:9) but different verb. Isa 24:20 — earth reels to and fro (H5128 nua = waver) like drunkard → judgment-destabilization. Ps 107:27 — sailors reel to and fro (H2287 chagag) → maritime judgment. Joel 2:9 — locust-army runs to and fro (H8264 shaqaq = course like beast of prey) in city → invasion pattern. Isa 33:4 — "running to and fro of locusts" (H4944 mashaq + H8264 shaqaq). Eph 4:14 — tossed to and fro (G2831 klydonizo = surge like waves) by every wind of doctrine → doctrinal instability = spiritual to-and-fro. Job 7:4 — tossings to and fro (H5076 nadud) on bed → restless suffering. Job 13:25 / Prov 21:6 — driven to and fro (H5086 nadaph = shove/disperse) → scattered, without anchor.

**PATTERN SYNTHESIS:**
Three agent-types perform to-and-fro: (1) **Adversary** — Satan/raven: restless traversal, no covenant home, seeking prey (Job 1:7; Gen 8:7; 1Pet 5:8); (2) **Divine surveillance** — God's eyes/angelic patrols: same motion but seeking to strengthen/report (2Chr 16:9; Zech 1:10; 4:10); (3) **Human desperation** — searching for truth/righteousness/escape in time of judgment (Jer 5:1; Dan 12:4; Amos 8:12). The H7752 derivative (scourge/whip) reveals the motion's physical nature: the to-and-fro stroke IS punishment. Those without covenant rest are themselves the lash. Tyre's rowers (Ezek 27:8,26) combine commerce + to-and-fro + sea → Babylon's economic system propelled by restless traversal, broken by east wind (God's judgment-wind). End-times convergence: Dan 12:4 (knowledge-explosion) + Amos 8:12 (word-famine) = two simultaneous to-and-fro movements — one finds human knowledge, the other cannot find God's word.
