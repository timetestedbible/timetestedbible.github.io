## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**H1270 barzel** — iron. ~76 OT occurrences.
**G4604 sideros** — iron. ~6 NT occurrences (Rev-heavy).

**KEY THREADS TO TRACE:**
- Dan 2:33,40 — legs of IRON = fourth kingdom (Rome). "Strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things." Iron = crushing military force.
- Dan 2:41-43 — feet of iron mixed with CLAY = LAST kingdom. "Partly strong and partly broken." "They shall not cleave one to another" = CANNOT cohere. Iron+clay = Babylon the Great's structural weakness.
- Dan 4:15,23 — stump bound with band of IRON and brass = Babylon RESTRAINED but preserved. Iron persists from legs into feet into stump-bands.
- Dan 7:7 — fourth beast: IRON teeth. Same iron = same kingdom DNA.
- Deut 4:20 — Egypt = "iron furnace." Iron furnace = place of testing/enslavement/forging.
- Jer 28:13-14 — wooden yoke broken → iron yoke replaces. Iron yoke = unbreakable bondage (Deut 28:48).
- Ps 2:9 / Rev 2:27 / Rev 12:5 / Rev 19:15 — "rule with rod of IRON." Christ takes iron (crushing force) and wields it righteously. Iron inverted: from beast's weapon → shepherd's rod.
- 1Ki 22:11 — Zedekiah's iron horns = false prophet's counterfeit authority.
- Isa 48:4 — "thy neck is an iron sinew" = stubbornness/hardened heart.

**IRON THREAD THROUGH DANIEL:** Legs (2:33) → teeth (7:7) → feet (2:41-43) → stump bands (4:15,23). Rome's DNA persists into the final form but degrades when mixed with clay. The iron never disappears — it just gets adulterated.

**DUAL VALENCE:** Iron = crushing power. When wielded by beasts = oppression/yoke. When wielded by Christ = righteous rule (rod of iron). Same material, different hands.

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive search of H1270 + G4604. 7+ candidates. Iron furnace (Deut 4:20, Jer 11:4, 1Ki 8:51). Iron yoke (Jer 28, Deut 28:48). Rod of iron (Ps 2:9, Rev 2:27, 12:5, 19:15). Production chain: ore → smelted with fire → forged. Iron is HARDER than gold/silver/bronze — it takes MORE fire to refine.
