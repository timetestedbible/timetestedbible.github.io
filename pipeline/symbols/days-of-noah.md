## Context Bag

**H5146 נֹחַ (Noach)** = "rest/comfort" (Gen 5:29). BDB: rest. LXX: Νῶε (G3575). NT carries G3575 unchanged.

**OCCURRENCES:**

**Gen 6:5-13** | SUBJ: Total corruption pre-flood. SCENE: Every thought evil continually; earth filled w/violence (חָמָס). COSYM: WICKEDNESS (lawlessness). ROLE: descriptor of era. CTX: narrative. SPEAKER: narrator/YHWH. DETAIL: "120 years" warning period; nephilim; "corrupt before God"; "the end of all flesh." CYCLE: Flood.

**Gen 7:1-24** | SUBJ: Flood execution. SCENE: 7 days waiting, then 40 days rain; all flesh dies. COSYM: ANIMAL, MOMENT (7-day countdown). ROLE: subject-context. DETAIL: 600th year, 2nd month, 17th day; 8 souls; clean/unclean distinction. CYCLE: Flood.

**Gen 8-9:17** | SUBJ: Covenant renewal post-flood. SCENE: Waters recede, altar, rainbow covenant. COSYM: NAME (covenant), ROCK (unchanging promise). DETAIL: 7th month ark rests; olive leaf; "never again." CYCLE: Flood.

**Isa 54:9** | SUBJ: YHWH's covenant faithfulness to restored Israel. SCENE: "This is as the waters of Noah to me." COSYM: MARRIAGE (covenant), MOUNTAIN (kingdom). ROLE: descriptor/analogy. CTX: prophetic oracle. HEADER: Isa 54:1 — barren woman singing. SPEAKER: YHWH. CYCLE: Return/Restoration.

**Matt 24:37-39** | SUBJ: Parousia timing. SCENE: Eating, drinking, marrying — "knew not until flood came and took them all away." COSYM: MARRIAGE, SLEEP (unaware), SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, RETURN_OF_CHRIST, RAPTURE_GATHERING (one taken/left). ROLE: primary analogy. CTX: discourse (Olivet). SPEAKER: Yeshua. DETAIL: "two in field, two grinding." CYCLE: Rome/End.

**Luke 17:26-30** | SUBJ: Days of Son of Man. SCENE: Parallel: Noah=flood, Lot=fire. COSYM: MARRIAGE, FIRE (Sodom), SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, MOMENT. ROLE: primary analogy. CTX: discourse. SPEAKER: Yeshua. DETAIL: "likewise" — eating/drinking/buying/selling/planting/building. CYCLE: Rome/End.

**1Pet 3:20-21** | SUBJ: Baptism as antitype of flood. SCENE: 8 souls saved through water; spirits in prison. COSYM: BELIEVE (obedience), WATER. ROLE: type. CTX: epistle. SPEAKER: Peter. DETAIL: "patience of God waited"; 8 = new beginning. CYCLE: Flood→Church.

**2Pet 2:5** | SUBJ: God spares righteous, judges wicked. SCENE: Noah "preacher of righteousness," world of ungodly flooded. COSYM: WICKEDNESS. ROLE: historical precedent. SPEAKER: Peter. CYCLE: Flood.

**2Pet 3:5-7** | SUBJ: Scoffers deny coming judgment. SCENE: World "overflowed with water" → present heavens "reserved for fire." COSYM: FIRE, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, MOMENT ("day of judgment"). ROLE: type→antitype (water→fire). SPEAKER: Peter. DETAIL: "willingly ignorant." CYCLE: End.

**CLUSTER:** Parousia/final judgment texts. Every NT use = analogy for covenant-ending judgment catching the disobedient unaware.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Normal life masking covenant violation → sudden total separation-judgment. Faithful minority preserved through, not removed from.

**ANOMALIES:** Isa 54:9 inverts — uses flood as promise of NO repeat judgment. Confirms flood = covenant-judgment pattern YHWH controls.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H5146→LXX Νῶε→NT G3575 direct. "Rest" (נוח) ironic: judgment brings rest/reset. Heb 4 rest-theology echoes.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** חָמָס (violence, Gen 6:11) = same word in prophets for covenant-breaking violence. Pattern: חמס→מבול→כרת.
