## Context Bag

**Critical definition (1Sa15:23):** Stubbornness = idolatry BECAUSE "thou hast REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD." Rebellion || witchcraft; stubbornness || idolatry. Explicit: IDOLATRY → rejecting God's word. Saul's sin = not bowing to statue but substituting own judgment for God's command.

**Equivalence (Col3:5):** Covetousness IS idolatry (explicit). Covetousness → self-desire → wanting what you want over God's ordinance. Confirms: idolatry at root = SELF-WILL, own desires/standard above God's.

**First Commandment (Exo20:3):** "No other gods before me." A "god" = whatever you serve, obey, trust, fear, look to as ultimate authority. Other gods = other authorities = not following God's word as standard. IDOLATRY → having other gods → serving other authorities.

**Heart idols (Eze14:3):** "Set up idols in their heart" → set up self-rule in heart. Internal, not merely external. Subj: Israel's elders.

**Warning (1Jn5:21):** "Keep yourselves from idols" → keep from self-rule. ✓ substitution.

**Mockery of idols (Isa44:16-17 + Psa115:4):** Idols = "work of men's hands." Man burns half a tree for fire, makes the rest a god, prays to it: "Deliver me." Absurdity: man CREATES own god then asks it to save. Essence → man creating own standard rather than submitting to God's.

**Hebrew roots [H]:** H6091 (atsab) → root "to shape/fashion" = man-made. H1544 (gillul) → root "to roll" = worthless/dung-like. Idols = man-made standards, human fabrications replacing God's eternal standard.

**Symbol chain:** FORNICATION (the act) → IDOLATRY (serving other masters) → SELF-RULE / REJECTING GOD'S WORD (the root). Deepest level: autonomy = self-law = being own god by making own standard.

**Connection to TRUTH:** TRUTH → God's standard/word/law. Following TRUTH = following God's standard. IDOLATRY = following ANOTHER standard (self, man, false gods). FAITH follows God's word (TRUTH) || IDOLATRY follows self's word.

**Opposite structure:** FAITH = obedience to God's standard || IDOLATRY = disobedience / following own standard. Standard: God's word vs. self's word. Posture: submission vs. autonomy. Action: obedience vs. self-rule.

**Substitution stress test:** 1Sa15:23 "stubbornness is as rejecting God's word" ✓ (explicit). Col3:5 "self-desire which is self-rule" ✓. Eze14:3 "set up self-rule in heart" ✓. 1Jn5:21 "keep from self-rule" ✓.

**Co-occurrences:** + TRUTH (what should be followed vs. what idolatry rejects) + FAITH (opposite) + BELIEVE (opposite action) + FORNICATION (the act of turning to idolatry) + HARLOT (idolater/covenant-breaker) + VIRGIN (opposite: faithful/exclusively devoted) + WICKEDNESS (lawlessness || idolatry) + BREAD (word/covenant terms → what is rejected) + NAME (covenant relationship → what is broken).

**Ultimate idol = SELF** — autonomy from God's word. One word: self-rule. Two words: rejecting God's word.
