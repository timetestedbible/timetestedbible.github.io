## Context Bag

**Core chain**: ROCK = Christ (1Co10:4 explicit: "that Rock was Christ") + Christ = Mediator of covenant (Heb8:6 "mediator of a better covenant"; Heb12:24 "mediator of the new covenant") → ROCK → COVENANT. Sealed by Heb13:20 "blood of the everlasting covenant."

**Symbolic chain**: ROCK (physical) → UNCHANGING (doesn't shift like SAND) → COVENANT (the unchanging thing between God and man). Lesson: don't stop at first abstraction—keep asking "what does THIS symbolize?" until concrete biblical concept reached. Failed attempts: "foundation" (too literal/physical synonym), "faithful" (undefined until FAITH resolved as obedience), "unchanging" (still abstract) → final: COVENANT.

**Character of Rock**: Deu32:4 "He is the Rock, his work is perfect… God of truth (H530 emunah = faithfulness)… just and right" → perfect work + faithfulness + justice + righteousness = character of covenant-keeper. TRUTH co-occurs → content/terms of covenant.

**Everlasting = unchanging**: Gen9:16 "everlasting covenant" (Noah) || Gen17:7,13,19 "everlasting covenant" (Abraham) || Eze16:60 "establish unto thee an everlasting covenant" || Eze37:26 "everlasting covenant… for evermore" || Heb13:20 "blood of the everlasting covenant." Covenant is THE unchanging thing—doesn't shift, doesn't fail.

**ROCK vs SAND contrast** (Mat7:24-27): ROCK = house stands in storms = unchanging foundation = COVENANT (binding, reliable). SAND = house falls = shifting foundation = broken promises (unreliable). Build on ROCK → build life on God's covenant promises. Build on SAND → build on shifting, unreliable word.

**Substitution test**: Deu32:4 "He is the Rock" → "He is the Covenant [Keeper]" ✓ | "Rock of my salvation" → "Covenant of my salvation" ✓ | Mat16:18 "upon this rock I will build my church" → "upon this covenant I will build my church" ✓ | 1Co10:4 "that Rock was Christ" → "that Covenant was Christ" ✓ (mediator!) | Deu32:31 "their rock is not as our Rock" → "their covenant is not as our Covenant" ✓ | Psa62:6 "He is my rock… I shall not be moved" → "He is my covenant… I shall not be moved" ✓ | Mat7:24-25 build on rock = stands → build on covenant = stands ✓.

**Symbol web**: TRUTH (God's Standard) defines covenant terms + ROCK (Covenant) binds God to His word unchangingly + FAITH (Obedience) = our response to covenant. ROCK stands → we STAND on it (stability) → it doesn't MOVE (binding, unchanging).

**Opposite**: SAND = broken promises / changing agreements / unreliable word—shifting where ROCK is fixed.
