## Context Bag

EXPLICIT DEFINITION: Wine = "blood of grapes" (Gen 49:11; Deut 32:14). Not metaphor → definitional statement. Scripture names wine as blood directly.

BLOOD = LIFE: "Life of the flesh is in the blood" + blood → atonement for the soul (Lev 17:11). Therefore WINE = blood of grapes = LIFE poured out.

BLOOD RATIFIES COVENANT: Moses took blood, sprinkled on people → "blood of the covenant" (Exod 24:8). || Zech 9:11 "blood of thy covenant" freed prisoners. || Heb 13:20 "blood of the everlasting covenant" → resurrection of Christ. Blood seals covenant; wine represents that blood.

CUP OF NEW COVENANT: Jesus connects wine → covenant blood explicitly. "This is my blood of the new covenant, shed for many for remission of sins" (Matt 26:28). "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20; 1Cor 11:25). Wine IS covenant blood — life poured out to ratify agreement.

BREAD + WINE TOGETHER (co-occurs BREAD): BREAD = Word/terms of covenant; WINE = blood/ratification of covenant. Mirrors Exod 24 sequence: (1) Moses reads covenant words (Exod 24:7) → BREAD; (2) Moses sprinkles blood on people (Exod 24:8) → WINE; (3) Elders eat + drink in God's presence (Exod 24:11) → covenant meal. Together = complete covenant meal.

WINE = JOY (covenant blessing): In covenant → wine brings gladness. "Wine that maketh glad the heart of man" (Ps 104:15). "Drink thy wine with a merry heart; God accepteth thy works" (Eccl 9:7). "New wine found in cluster… a blessing is in it" (Isa 65:8). Joy flows from covenant relationship — life shared with God.

WINE = WRATH (covenant broken): Same blood → judgment when covenant rejected. "Wine of the wrath of God, poured out without mixture" (Rev 14:10). BABYLON given "cup of wine of fierceness of his wrath" (Rev 16:19; co-occurs BABYLON). "He treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God" (Rev 19:15). Blood rejected → blood guilt. Covenant blood that should bring life → brings death instead.

DUAL NATURE: In covenant → life-blood shared → joy, blessing, fellowship. Covenant broken → blood guilt → wrath, judgment, death. Same wine, different outcome → depends on covenant standing.

DRINK HIS BLOOD = RECEIVE HIS LIFE: "Except ye drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso drinketh my blood hath eternal life" (John 6:53-54). Drinking blood = (1) receive His life, (2) enter His covenant, (3) accept terms ratified by that blood.

RELATED SYMBOLS: BREAD → Word/covenant terms (paired); BLOOD → life/covenant seal; CUP → portion/destiny; GRAPES → source of wine/FRUIT of the vine; WINEPRESS → judgment/blood poured out.
