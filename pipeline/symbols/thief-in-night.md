**G2812** (κλέπτης kléptēs) — a stealer (literally or figuratively). From G2813 (κλέπτω, to steal). KJV: "thief." 16x NT. English "kleptomaniac" derives from this root.

## Context Bag

### A. ESCHATOLOGICAL "THIEF" CLUSTER — the Day of the Lord

1Th 5:2 — "day of Lord comes as a thief (G2812) in the night (G3571)." co: NIGHT+DAY+SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION+SLEEP+DARKNESS+BIRTH_PAINS. spkr: Paul. Context: immediately follows 1Th 4:17 (APANTESIS). The thief image = timing is UNKNOWN to the unaware. v.3: "peace and safety → sudden destruction." v.4: "BUT YE, brethren, are NOT in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief." KEY: the thief analogy applies ONLY to those in darkness/sleep. Believers who watch are EXEMPT from the surprise.

1Th 5:4 — "ye brethren are NOT in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief (G2812)." Explicit exclusion: the day comes as a thief ONLY to the spiritually asleep. Those awake/watching experience the SAME event but are not caught off-guard.

Mat 24:43 — "if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief (G2812) would come, he would have watched." spkr: Jesus. Olivet Discourse. co: WATCH+NIGHT(watch). Point: the householder's failure was NOT watching. Had he watched, the thief would still come — but not catch him unprepared. v.44: "therefore be ye also ready."

Lk 12:39 — Parallel to Mat 24:43. "if the goodman had known what hour the thief (G2812) would come, he would have watched." Same logic: failure = not watching.

2Pet 3:10 — "day of Lord will come as a thief (G2812) in the night (G3571); heavens pass away with great noise, elements melt with fervent heat." co: FIRE+DAY_OF_LORD. Context: v.3-4 scoffers saying "where is the promise of his coming?" — those mocking are the ones surprised. v.9: God is not slack, but longsuffering. The thief-arrival IS the cosmic judgment.

Rev 3:3 — "If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief (G2812), and thou shalt not know what hour." spkr: Christ to Sardis. co: WATCH+GARMENTS. CONDITIONAL: "IF thou shalt NOT watch." If they DO watch, the thief-surprise does NOT apply. Confirms 1Th 5:4 — watchfulness removes the "thief" quality of the arrival.

Rev 16:15 — "Behold, I come as a thief (G2812). Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked." spkr: Christ. POSITION: inserted between 6th and 7th bowl judgments — deep into judgment sequence. co: WATCH+GARMENTS+NAKED+SHAME. Even at this late stage, the thief-warning persists. Those watching are BLESSED; those not watching are exposed/shamed.

### B. THE ENEMY AS THIEF — John 10

Jn 10:1 — "he that entereth not by the door… same is a thief (G2812) and a robber (G3027)." spkr: Jesus. DIFFERENT USAGE: the thief here is the false shepherd/enemy who enters illegitimately.

Jn 10:8 — "all that ever came before me are thieves (G2812) and robbers." False leaders stealing the flock.

Jn 10:10 — "The thief (G2812) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life." CRITICAL CONTRAST: the thief = the enemy (steal+kill+destroy) vs. Christ = life+abundance. Christ is NOT the thief in John 10. The thief is the ENEMY. In the eschatological cluster (1Th 5, Mat 24, Rev 3, Rev 16), Christ comes LIKE a thief in MANNER (unexpected) but is not the thief in IDENTITY.

### C. LITERAL/MORAL THIEF USES

Jn 12:6 — Judas "was a thief (G2812), and had the bag." Literal. One of the Twelve was the thief from within — betrayer in the house.

Mat 6:19-20 — thieves break through on earth, not in heaven. Treasure vulnerability.

Lk 12:33 — "no thief approacheth" — heavenly treasure beyond theft.

1Cor 6:10 — "thieves… shall not inherit the kingdom." Moral category.

1Pet 4:15 — "let none suffer as a thief." Moral exhortation.

Mat 26:55/Mk 14:48/Lk 22:52 — "are ye come out as against a thief?" Jesus at his arrest — irony: they treat the Messiah as a criminal.

### D. OT THIEF PATTERN

Exo 22:2,7-8 — Torah: thief caught breaking in at night may be killed; thief must pay double. Night = cover of darkness; the thief exploits DARKNESS.

Joel 2:9 — locust army "enter at windows like a thief." Invasion imagery.

Jer 2:26 — "as the thief is ashamed when found, so the house of Israel." Covenant shame = being caught.

Zec 5:4 — flying scroll enters "house of the thief" and consumes it. Covenant curse on theft.

Hos 7:1 — "the thief cometh in" while God would heal. Israel's corruption.

### E. PATTERN SYNTHESIS

**WHO is surprised?** Only the unwatchful. 1Th 5:4 and Rev 3:3 explicitly exempt the watching. The "thief" quality is NOT about the nature of Christ's coming — it's about the STATE of those it catches. Same event, two experiences: watchers are blessed (Rev 16:15), sleepers receive sudden destruction (1Th 5:3).

**WHAT is stolen?** In eschatological use: nothing is literally stolen. The analogy is MANNER only — unexpected timing, arrival in darkness. In John 10: the enemy-thief steals life. In Zec 5:4: the curse consumes the thief's house.

**NIGHT+DARKNESS+SLEEP cluster:** Every eschatological thief passage co-occurs with night/darkness/sleep language. The thief operates in darkness; those in the light see him coming. 1Th 5:5-8 builds the full contrast: children of light/day vs. children of night/darkness; sleeping/drunk vs. watching/sober.

**STRUCTURAL IRONY:** Christ comes "as a thief" to those in darkness — but he IS the light. The thief analogy self-destructs for believers: if you're in the light, you see the arrival. The "thief" image only works on those who chose darkness. The surprise is self-inflicted.

**Rev 16:15 POSITION:** Between bowls 6 and 7. Even DURING active judgment, Christ still warns "I come as a thief." This means the thief-coming is not a singular past event but a PRESENT reality throughout the judgment sequence. Watchfulness is never finished.
