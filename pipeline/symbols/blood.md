## Lexical Field

**[H1818] dam** = blood (as that which when shed causes death) of man or animal; by analogy, the juice of the grape; figuratively bloodshed. From H1826 damam "to be dumb, silent, stop, perish" (compare H119 adam "to show blood in the face, flush, turn rosy"). ~295× OT. Root connection: dam→damam = when blood flows out, the creature falls SILENT/STILL/PERISHES. Blood leaving = silence/death. H119 adam → H120 adam "man" = "the blood-showing creature, ruddy." H122 adom "red." MAN IS NAMED FOR HIS BLOOD — humanity is the blood-bearing image of God.

**[G129] haima** = blood, literally (of men or animals), figuratively (juice of grapes) or specially (atoning blood of Christ); by implication bloodshed, also kindred. "Of uncertain derivation." ~97× NT. **[G130] haimatekchysia** = effusion/shedding of blood. From G129 + derivative of G1632 ekcheo "to pour out." 1× (Heb 9:22). The NT coinages: blood-POURING-OUT as a single technical concept.

**GRAPE CONNECTION**: Gen 49:11 "blood of grapes" (H1818+H6025). Deut 32:14 "pure blood of the grape." WINE = blood of the grape. Blood of flesh = life of the creature. Blood/juice of grape = life of the vine. When pressed/crushed, the life comes out. Production chain: VINE→GRAPE→PRESS→WINE(=blood). This is WHY Jesus uses wine at the Last Supper — "this is my blood" (Matt 26:28). The grape/wine symbol is BLOOD's agricultural register.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **Physical red fluid** — fails figurative uses (moon AS blood, waters BECOME blood, grape blood, "flesh and blood" = mortal nature). Too narrow.
2. **Death itself** — nearly works but Lev 17:11 says blood is the LIFE, not death. Blood IN the body = life. Blood OUT = death. It's not death; it's what carries life.
3. **The soul/spirit** — Lev 17:11 says "life [H5315 nephesh] of the flesh is IN the blood" — blood CARRIES nephesh but is not identical to it. Fails "blood of grapes" (grape has no soul).
4. **Price/payment/ransom** — fits atonement contexts (1Pet 1:18-19, Eph 1:7) but fails cosmic signs (moon as blood = payment?), fails Gen 4:10 (Abel's blood CRIES, doesn't pay), fails Exod 7:17 (water→blood = not about payment). Too narrow.
5. **Evidence of death/violence** — fits many judgment contexts but fails Lev 17:11 (blood on altar = atonement = positive), John 6:53-56 (drink blood = receive life), Gen 49:11 (blood of grapes = blessing). Too negative.
6. **Kinship/lineage** — fits "flesh and blood" (Matt 16:17, 1Cor 15:50) and Eph 2:13 partially, but fails plague contexts, fails atonement mechanism, fails cosmic signs. Too narrow.
7. ✓ **The life of the flesh made visible — which when offered atones, when taken accuses, and when displayed marks what belongs to God** — passes ALL contexts. See substitution test. The key: blood is LIFE-IN-PHYSICAL-FORM. Its meaning depends entirely on HOW it is released. Three modes: (a) OFFERED by the bearer → atonement/covenant; (b) TAKEN by another → guilt/accusation; (c) DISPLAYED as sign → marking of territory/identity/judgment.
8. **Sacred substance** — too vague, doesn't distinguish between offering and murder contexts.
9. **Covenant seal** — fits Exod 24:8, Matt 26:28, Heb 13:20 but fails plague contexts, fails "innocent blood," fails grape metaphor. Too narrow.
10. **God's exclusive property** — captures Gen 9:4-6, Lev 17:11 (God gave it for atonement) but is a sub-principle rather than the meaning itself. Blood belongs to God BECAUSE it is the life and life belongs to God.

## Context Bag

**THE DEFINING EQUATION**: Lev 17:11 — "the life[H5315 nephesh] of the flesh is IN the blood[H1818]; I have GIVEN it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls[H5315]." Three-part revelation: (1) blood = life-carrier, (2) GOD gave it (blood belongs to God, not man), (3) purpose = atonement = life-for-life exchange. Lev 17:14 confirms: "the blood of it IS for the life thereof." Gen 9:4 — prohibition against eating blood with flesh = don't consume the life; it's God's. Blood's meaning derives entirely from this equation: blood = visible, physical life.

**THREE MODES OF BLOOD**: Every occurrence falls into one of three categories based on HOW the life is released:
**(A) OFFERED** → atonement/covenant: Exod 12:13 (passover lamb), Exod 24:8 (covenant ratification), Lev 16:14 (Day of Atonement sprinkled 7× on mercy seat), Matt 26:28 (new covenant), Heb 9:12-14 (entered holy place by own blood), Heb 9:22 (no remission without), Rom 3:25 (propitiation through faith in his blood), Rom 5:9 (justified by), Eph 1:7 (redemption through), Col 1:20 (peace through blood of cross), 1Pet 1:18-19 (redeemed by precious blood, lamb without blemish), 1Jn 1:7 (cleanseth from all sin), Rev 1:5 (washed from sins), Rev 5:9 (redeemed by blood from every nation), Rev 7:14 (robes washed white in blood of Lamb), Rev 12:11 (overcame by blood of Lamb).
**(B) TAKEN** → guilt/accusation: Gen 4:10 (Abel's blood CRIES from ground—first blood shed, first testimony), Gen 9:5-6 (God requires blood), Num 35:33 (blood defiles land; only blood of shedder cleanses), Deut 19:10 (innocent blood not shed), 2Kgs 21:16, 24:4 (Manasseh filled Jerusalem with innocent blood — LORD WOULD NOT PARDON), Ps 106:38 (shed blood of sons/daughters to idols → land POLLUTED), Matt 23:35 (all righteous blood from Abel to Zechariah required of THIS generation), Matt 27:4 (Judas: "betrayed innocent blood"), Matt 27:24-25 (Pilate washes hands / people: "his blood on us and our children"), Rev 6:10 (souls cry: "avenge our blood"), Rev 16:6 (shed blood of saints → given blood to drink), Rev 17:6 (harlot drunk with blood of saints), Rev 18:24 (in Babylon found blood of ALL slain on earth), Rev 19:2 (avenged blood of servants at her hand), Deut 32:43 (God will avenge blood of servants).
**(C) DISPLAYED** → sign/marker of judgment: Exod 7:17-19 (water→blood = first plague; provision→death-testimony), Rev 8:7 (hail+fire+blood = first trumpet), Rev 8:8 (sea→blood = second trumpet), Rev 16:3-4 (sea/rivers→blood = second+third bowls), Rev 11:6 (two witnesses turn water→blood), Joel 2:30/Acts 2:19 (blood+fire+smoke = signs before Day of LORD), Joel 2:31/Acts 2:20 (moon→blood = before Day of LORD), Rev 6:12 (moon as blood = sixth seal).

**BLOOD SPEAKS**: Heb 12:24 — blood of sprinkling that "SPEAKS better things than Abel." Gen 4:10 — Abel's blood CRIES [H6817 tsa'aq] from ground. Blood is never silent (ironic: H1818 dam from H1826 damam "to be silent" — when the creature falls silent, the blood begins to speak). Abel's blood cries for JUSTICE; Christ's blood speaks for MERCY. Two testimonies of shed life: accusation vs intercession. Rev 6:10 extends Abel's cry: "how long until you avenge OUR blood?" — the martyrs' blood is still speaking.

**WATERS→BLOOD PATTERN**: Exod 7:17 (first plague: Nile→blood; fish die, river stinks). Rev 8:8 (second trumpet: sea→blood). Rev 16:3 (second bowl: sea→blood of dead man; every living soul dies in sea). Rev 16:4 (third bowl: rivers/fountains→blood). Rev 11:6 (witnesses turn water→blood). Pattern: God's judgment INVERTS provision into death-testimony. Water sustains life; blood testifies of life taken. When waters become blood, the sustaining system becomes an accusation system. Rev 16:5-6 explains the logic: "they shed blood of saints → thou gavest them blood to drink." RECOMPENSE: what you shed, you must now consume.

**GRAPE-BLOOD-WINEPRESS**: Gen 49:11 — "blood of grapes" = WINE. Deut 32:14 — "pure blood of the grape." Isa 63:2-3 — garments red, "blood sprinkled on my garments" from treading winepress ALONE. Rev 14:20 — winepress trodden, blood flows up to horse bridles, 1600 furlongs. Rev 19:13 — vesture dipped in blood + name = Word of God. CO: WINE, WINEPRESS. The grape IS a blood-analogue: life of the vine in liquid form, released by PRESSING (crushing/suffering). Christ = grape crushed → blood/wine released → new covenant. Winepress of God's wrath = nations crushed → blood flows = life extracted through judgment. Same mechanism, dual register: offering vs. judgment.

**FLESH-AND-BLOOD = MORTAL LIFE-FORM**: Matt 16:17 — "flesh and blood not revealed it." 1Cor 15:50 — "flesh and blood CANNOT inherit kingdom of God." Eph 6:12 — "wrestle not against flesh and blood." Heb 2:14 — Christ partook of flesh and blood. The phrase "flesh and blood" = mortal human nature. Blood here = biological life that ENDS. This is why blood must be shed for the transition: mortal life-form must be released for immortal to come. Christ entered THROUGH blood (Heb 9:12) — through the release of mortal life — into the eternal.

**PATTERN SUMMARY**: Blood is the LIFE OF THE FLESH in visible form. Five invariant properties: (1) BELONGS TO GOD — Gen 9:4-5, Lev 17:11 "I have given it"; (2) SPEAKS/TESTIFIES — Gen 4:10, Heb 12:24 (blood is never silent once shed); (3) REQUIRES ACCOUNTING — Gen 9:5 "surely your blood will I require," Num 35:33, Rev 6:10, 16:6, 18:24; (4) ATONES when offered — Lev 17:11, Heb 9:22 (life given covers life owed); (5) POLLUTES when taken — Num 35:33, Ps 106:38 (shed innocent blood defiles land). The waters→blood judgment inverts sustaining provision into death-testimony. The blood-of-grapes connection links blood to WINE to WINEPRESS: the crushing that releases life. Cross-ref: wine.md, sea.md, fire.md, harlot.md, fall-of-babylon.md (Rev 17:6, 18:24 — Babylon's blood-guilt).
