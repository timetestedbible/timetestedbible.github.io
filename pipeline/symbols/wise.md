## Context Bag

**Core definition:** WISE → Obedient. One who hears God's instruction + DOES it. Not intelligence but responsive action to God's word.

**Three explicit definitions:**
1. Ps 111:10 — "fear of LORD = beginning of WISDOM; good understanding have all they that DO his commandments" → WISDOM = DOING commandments (direct definition).
2. Deut 4:6 — "KEEP therefore and DO them; for this is your WISDOM" → Israel's wisdom demonstrated by keeping/doing statutes.
3. Matt 7:24 — "heareth these sayings of mine and DOETH them → WISE man" → WISE explicitly = hears + does.

**Primary evidence:**
- Prov 10:8 — "WISE in heart will RECEIVE commandments" || "prating FOOL shall fall." WISE receives commands; FOOL rejects.
- Prov 12:15 — "fool right in own eyes" || "he that hearkeneth unto counsel is WISE." WISE hearkens; FOOL self-directs.
- Prov 1:7 — "fear of LORD = beginning of knowledge" || "FOOLS despise wisdom + instruction." WISE = opposite of despising instruction.

**Antithesis pair (WISE || FOOL):**
Hears + DOES || hears + does NOT (Matt 7:24-26). Receives commandments || despises instruction (Prov 10:8, 1:7). Fears LORD || says "no God" (Prov 1:7, Ps 14:1). Hearkens to counsel || right in own eyes (Prov 12:15). Had OIL || no OIL (Matt 25:3-4). Built on ROCK || built on SAND (Matt 7:24-26).

**Parable applications:**
- Matt 7:24-27 — Two builders: WISE = hears + does → builds on ROCK (covenant). Foolish = hears + does NOT → builds on SAND (broken covenant). subj: obedience vs disobedience under trial.
- Matt 25:1-13 — Ten virgins: WISE had OIL (proven works) + LAMPS (commandments). Foolish had LAMPS but no OIL. Both heard; only WISE acted. Matt 25:2 — "five were WISE, five foolish."

**Symbol web connections:** WISE + FAITH (obedience in action) + TRUTH (does God's standard) + OIL (proven works of obedience) + LIGHT (visible example produced by wise) + ROCK (covenant foundation for wise builder).

**Substitution test — all pass ✓:** Prov 10:8 "obedient in heart receives commandments." Matt 7:24 "obedient man built on rock." Matt 25:2 "five obedient, five disobedient." Prov 12:15 "hearkeneth = obedient." 1 Cor 3:18 "become disobedient to world → obedient to God." Eph 5:15 "walk not as disobedient but as obedient."

**Hebrew/Greek:** H2450 chakam (wise, skillful) — most common OT term. H2451 chokmah (wisdom, skill) — Ps 111:10. G4680 sophos (wise) — 1 Cor 3:18, Eph 5:15. G5429 phronimos (prudent, sensible) — Matt 7:24, Matt 25:2.

**Confidence: HIGH** — explicitly defined (Ps 111:10, Matt 7:24), perfect antithesis with FOOL, coherent across all Hebrew/Greek terms, consistent with symbol web.
