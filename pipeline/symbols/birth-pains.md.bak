**CLUSTER:** Overwhelmingly prophetic judgment contexts. Always: existing order broken → new thing emerges. Pain=transitional, not terminal.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Covenant judgment producing new covenant order. The pain signals transition, not destruction. Always precedes deliverance/birth of something new.

**ANOMALIES:** Isa 42:14 — YHWH Himself travails (unique). Acts 2:24 — death's pangs loosed=resurrection reframes death as failed labor.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H2256→LXX ὠδίν→NT ὠδίν (G5604). Direct linguistic chain. Matt 24:8 deliberately echoes OT prophetic pattern.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H2256 *chebel* double-meaning cord+pain links binding/covenant to labor — visible only in Hebrew. Judgment=covenant cord tightening.
