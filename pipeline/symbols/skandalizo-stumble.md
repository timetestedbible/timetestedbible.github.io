## Context Bag

**G4624 skandalizo — NT trap-verb (29×):**
Mat 5:29-30 — subj: eye/hand. role: body-member as internal trap-source. pattern: radical amputation over systemic entrapment.
Mat 11:6 / Lk 7:23 — subj: Jesus. co: FAITH. role: blessed = NOT skandalizo'd by Jesus. cycle: Ministry. Inverse: Jesus himself IS the test.
Mat 13:21 / Mk 4:17 — subj: rootless hearer. co: BIRTH_PAINS (thlipsis G2347), persecution (G1375). role: pressure→trap activates→departure. DEFINING MECHANISM: external tribulation triggers skandalizo in the shallow.
Mat 13:57 / Mk 6:3 — subj: hometown. role: familiarity breeds skandalon. cycle: Rejection.
Mat 15:12 — subj: Pharisees. co: WORD (logos). role: truth itself = trap for the hardened.
Mat 16:23 — subj: Peter = skandalon to Jesus. co: SATAN. role: human agenda = trap for divine mission. Unique: Jesus names a disciple as skandalon.
Mat 18:6-7 / Mk 9:42 / Lk 17:1-2 — subj: whoever causes little-one to stumble. co: SEA (millstone+drowning). role: WOE oracle. Skandalon MUST come but woe to its agent. Structural necessity + personal culpability.
Mat 18:8-9 / Mk 9:43-47 — subj: hand/foot/eye. co: FIRE (gehenna). role: better maimed than whole-into-fire. Self-skandalizo = self-entrapment.

**Mat 26:31,33 / Mk 14:27,29** — subj: ALL disciples. co: SHEPHERD (smitten), SHEEP (scattered). role: Zech 13:7 fulfillment. Strike shepherd → flock skandalizo'd → scatter. Peter's "never" = 2× denial-irony. Pattern: persecution of leader → mass skandalizo.
Jn 6:61 — subj: disciples. co: hard saying (flesh/blood). role: doctrine itself = skandalon.
**Jn 16:1** — subj: disciples warned. co: persecution (v2 synagogue exclusion, v2 killing=service to God). role: Jesus warns SPECIFICALLY to prevent skandalizo. Warning = inoculation against the trap.

Rom 9:33 / 1Pet 2:8 — Christ = stone of stumbling (proskomma G4348) + rock of skandalon. co: ROCK, FAITH (believe→not ashamed). PARADOX: the cornerstone IS the trap for unbelief. Isa 8:14 source.
Rom 11:9 — Israel's table = snare (pagis G3803) + trap (thera G2339) + skandalon. co: David (Ps 69:22).
Rom 11:11 — "Have they stumbled (G4417 ptaio) that they should fall? God forbid." Stumbling ≠ permanent fall for Israel.
Rom 16:17 — those causing divisions + skandalon contrary to doctrine. co: DECEIVE.
1Cor 1:23 — Christ crucified = skandalon to Jews. co: FOOLISH (to Greeks).
Gal 5:11 — skandalon of the cross. If circumcision preached, cross's skandalon ceases.
1Jn 2:10 — no skandalon in him who loves brother. co: LIGHT. Love = trap-immunity.
**Rev 2:14** — doctrine of Balaam: cast skandalon before Israel → eat idol-sacrifices + fornication. co: IDOLATRY, FORNICATION. Pattern: false teaching = deliberate skandalon-placement. Num 22-25 → Rev 2 = oldest skandalon-strategy recycled.

**H4383 mikshol — OT stumbling-block (14×):**
Lev 19:14 — do not put mikshol before the blind. Foundation: deliberate entrapment = sin.
Isa 8:14 — YHWH = sanctuary OR stone of stumbling + rock of offence (mikshol). co: SNARE (H6341 pach), GIN (H4170 moqesh). Same paradox as Rom 9:33.
Isa 57:14 — take up mikshol from way of my people. co: WAY. Restoration = clearing traps.
Jer 6:21 — I will LAY stumblingblocks (mikshol) before this people; fathers+sons fall (kashal) together. GOD PLACES the trap as judgment. co: kashal.
Ezek 7:19 — gold/silver = mikshol of their iniquity. Wealth = stumbling-block.
Ezek 14:3,4,7 — idols in heart = mikshol of iniquity before face. 3× repeated. co: IDOLATRY. DEFINING: the stumbling-block IS the idol. Internal idol → external fall.
Ezek 44:12 — priests caused Israel to fall (mikshol) into iniquity by idol-ministering.
Ps 119:165 — great peace to torah-lovers; NOTHING shall be mikshol to them. co: PEACE, LAW. Antidote: deep torah-love = trap-immunity.

**H3782 kashal — OT stumble/fall (65×, key occurrences):**
Isa 8:15 — many shall stumble+fall+be broken+snared+taken. Five-stage collapse sequence.
Isa 28:13 — fall backward+broken+snared+taken. Same five-stage = Isa 8:15 doublet.
Isa 40:30 — youths faint, young men utterly kashal. Even strength fails without God.
Isa 59:10,14 — stumble at noonday as in night; truth fallen (kashal) in the street. co: DARKNESS, TRUTH.
Jer 6:21 — mikshol placed → kashal upon them. Noun+verb paired.
Jer 18:15 — caused to stumble from ancient paths. co: WAY, IDOLATRY (vanity).
Jer 50:32 — the most PROUD shall kashal+fall, none raise up. co: BABYLON. Babylon itself stumbles.
**Dan 11:33-35** — they that understand (H7919 sakal) shall instruct many; yet shall kashal by sword, flame, captivity, spoil, many days. Some of understanding kashal to TRY (H6884 tsaraph = refine), PURGE (H1305 barar = clarify), make WHITE (H3835 laban), even to TIME OF END (H7093 qets). CRITICAL: righteous kashal = REFINING MECHANISM, not judgment. Persecution-triggered stumbling PURIFIES the wise. Dan 11:33-35 = Mat 24:9-14 structural twin.
Hos 4:5 — fall in day, prophet falls in night. co: DARKNESS.
Hos 5:5 — Israel+Ephraim kashal in iniquity; Judah with them.
Hos 14:1 — fallen (kashal) by iniquity → RETURN to YHWH. Kashal as premise for repentance.
Hos 14:9 — ways of LORD right; just walk in them; transgressors kashal therein. Same path = standing for righteous, trap for wicked. Parallel to Isa 8:14 sanctuary/stumblingstone paradox.
Mal 2:8 — priests caused many to kashal at the law. co: COVENANT (Levi). Corrupt priests = stumbling-agents.

## Pattern Summary

**Mechanism:** skandalizo/skandalon = trap-stick of a snare. NOT "offended" in modern emotional sense. The physical image: bent sapling holding bait; touch it → spring shuts → prey caught. External pressure (tribulation, persecution, doctrine, familiarity) → activates internal weakness (rootlessness, idolatry, pride) → covenant departure (apostasy, betrayal, hate).

**Five patterns across corpus:**
1. **Persecution→skandalizo cascade:** Mat 13:21 → Mat 24:10 → Mat 26:31 → Dan 11:33-35. Thlipsis triggers the trap in the shallow/rootless. THE mechanism of apostasy in the Olivet discourse.
2. **Christ=skandalon paradox:** Isa 8:14 → Rom 9:33 → 1Pet 2:8 → 1Cor 1:23. The cornerstone IS the trap-stick for unbelief. Same person = sanctuary OR stumblingstone. Faith determines which.
3. **Deliberate skandalon-placement:** Lev 19:14 (before blind) → Jer 6:21 (God places) → Ezek 14:3-7 (idols=mikshol) → Rev 2:14 (Balaam's doctrine). Both humans and God place stumbling-blocks. Human placement = sin. Divine placement = judgment-test.
4. **Idol=stumbling-block identity:** Ezek 14:3,4,7 (3×) + Ezek 7:19 (wealth) + Ezek 44:12 (priests). The mikshol IS the idol in the heart. Internal worship disorder = external fall mechanism.
5. **Purification through stumbling:** Dan 11:33-35 — the wise kashal but it REFINES, PURGES, WHITENS them. Not all stumbling = judgment. For the understanding, kashal = crucible. Connected to Mat 24:9-14 where persecution produces endurance, not just apostasy.

**Antidotes:** Ps 119:165 — torah-love = no mikshol. 1Jn 2:10 — love = no skandalon. Jn 16:1 — forewarning prevents skandalizo. Pattern: depth (root) + love + warning = trap-immunity.
