## Context Bag

**G4624 skandalizo (29×):**
Mat 5:29-30 — subj: eye/hand. Radical amputation over systemic entrapment.
Mat 11:6 / Lk 7:23 — subj: Jesus himself IS the test. co: FAITH. Blessed = NOT skandalizo'd.
Mat 13:21 / Mk 4:17 — subj: rootless hearer. co: BIRTH_PAINS (thlipsis), persecution. DEFINING: external pressure → trap activates → departure.
Mat 13:57 / Mk 6:3 — subj: hometown. Familiarity breeds skandalon.
Mat 15:12 — subj: Pharisees. Truth itself = trap for the hardened.
Mat 16:23 — subj: Peter = skandalon to Jesus. co: SATAN. Human agenda = trap for divine mission.
Mat 18:6-7 / Mk 9:42 / Lk 17:1-2 — subj: causing little-one to stumble. co: SEA (millstone). Skandalon MUST come but woe to agent.
Mat 18:8-9 / Mk 9:43-47 — subj: hand/foot/eye. co: FIRE (gehenna). Self-entrapment.
Mat 24:10 — subj: MANY. co: BETRAY+HATE+DECEIVE. CRITICAL: skandalizo→betray→hate = apostasy cascade. Persecution (v9) = trigger; skandalizo = mechanism.
Mat 26:31,33 / Mk 14:27,29 — subj: ALL disciples. co: SHEPHERD (smitten), SHEEP (scattered). Zech 13:7. Strike shepherd → flock skandalizo'd → scatter.
Jn 6:61 — doctrine itself = skandalon. Jn 16:1 — Jesus warns to PREVENT skandalizo. Warning = inoculation.
Rom 14:21 / 1Cor 8:13 — relational skandalon. 2Cor 11:29 — apostolic empathy.

**G4625 skandalon (15×):**
Mat 13:41 — angels gather ALL skandalon at end. co: WICKEDNESS. Systemic until harvest.
Mat 18:7 — MUST come. Structural inevitability.
Rom 9:33 / 1Pet 2:8 — Christ = stone of stumbling + rock of skandalon. co: ROCK, FAITH. PARADOX: cornerstone IS trap for unbelief. Source: Isa 8:14.
Rom 11:9 — Israel's table = snare+trap+skandalon. Rom 11:11 — stumbling ≠ permanent fall for Israel.
Rom 16:17 — divisions+skandalon contrary to doctrine. co: DECEIVE.
1Cor 1:23 — cross = skandalon to Jews. Gal 5:11 — skandalon of cross ceases if circumcision preached.
1Jn 2:10 — love = no skandalon. co: LIGHT. Trap-immunity.
Rev 2:14 — Balaam's doctrine: skandalon before Israel → idols+fornication. co: IDOLATRY. Oldest strategy recycled.

**H4383 mikshol (14×):**
Lev 19:14 — don't put mikshol before blind. Foundation: deliberate entrapment = sin.
Isa 8:14 — YHWH = sanctuary OR stone of stumbling (mikshol). co: SNARE. Same paradox as Rom 9:33.
Isa 57:14 — take up mikshol from way. Restoration = clearing traps.
Jer 6:21 — GOD PLACES mikshol; fathers+sons kashal together. co: kashal.
Ezek 7:19 — gold/silver = mikshol. Wealth = stumbling-block.
Ezek 14:3,4,7 — idols in heart = mikshol of iniquity. 3× repeated. co: IDOLATRY. DEFINING: stumbling-block IS the idol. Internal idol → external fall.
Ps 119:165 — torah-lovers: NOTHING = mikshol. co: PEACE. Antidote.

**H3782 kashal (65×, key):**
Isa 8:15 — stumble→fall→broken→snared→taken. Five-stage collapse. Isa 28:13 = doublet.
Isa 59:10,14 — stumble at noonday; truth fallen in street. co: DARKNESS.
Jer 50:32 — PROUD kashal+fall. co: BABYLON. Babylon itself stumbles.
Dan 11:33-35 — CRITICAL: wise instruct many, yet kashal by sword/flame/captivity. Kashal → TRY (H6884 refine) + PURGE (H1305 clarify) + WHITE (H3835) to TIME OF END. Righteous kashal = REFINING, not judgment. = Mat 24:9-14 structural twin.
Hos 14:1 — kashal by iniquity → RETURN to YHWH. Premise for repentance.
Hos 14:9 — same path: just walk, transgressors kashal. = Isa 8:14 paradox.
Mal 2:8 — priests caused many to kashal at law. Corrupt priests = stumbling-agents.

## Pattern Summary

**Mechanism:** skandalizo/skandalon = trap-stick of a snare. NOT "offended" in modern emotional sense. The physical image: bent sapling holding bait; touch it → spring shuts → prey caught. External pressure (tribulation, persecution, doctrine, familiarity) → activates internal weakness (rootlessness, idolatry, pride) → covenant departure (apostasy, betrayal, hate).

**Five patterns across corpus:**
1. **Persecution→skandalizo cascade:** Mat 13:21 → Mat 24:10 → Mat 26:31 → Dan 11:33-35. Thlipsis triggers the trap in the shallow/rootless. THE mechanism of apostasy in the Olivet discourse.
2. **Christ=skandalon paradox:** Isa 8:14 → Rom 9:33 → 1Pet 2:8 → 1Cor 1:23. The cornerstone IS the trap-stick for unbelief. Same person = sanctuary OR stumblingstone. Faith determines which.
3. **Deliberate skandalon-placement:** Lev 19:14 (before blind) → Jer 6:21 (God places) → Ezek 14:3-7 (idols=mikshol) → Rev 2:14 (Balaam's doctrine). Both humans and God place stumbling-blocks. Human placement = sin. Divine placement = judgment-test.
4. **Idol=stumbling-block identity:** Ezek 14:3,4,7 (3×) + Ezek 7:19 (wealth) + Ezek 44:12 (priests). The mikshol IS the idol in the heart. Internal worship disorder = external fall mechanism.
5. **Purification through stumbling:** Dan 11:33-35 — the wise kashal but it REFINES, PURGES, WHITENS them. Not all stumbling = judgment. For the understanding, kashal = crucible. Connected to Mat 24:9-14 where persecution produces endurance, not just apostasy.

**Antidotes:** Ps 119:165 — torah-love = no mikshol. 1Jn 2:10 — love = no skandalon. Jn 16:1 — forewarning prevents skandalizo. Pattern: depth (root) + love + warning = trap-immunity.
