## Context Bag

STUB — G4624 skandalizo from G4625 skandalon = trigger-stick of a trap/snare. Not "offended" in modern sense but ENTRAPPED — the mechanism that catches prey. Mat 24:10 = persecution triggers the trap causing many to fall. Mat 13:21 = tribulation/persecution causes rootless to stumble. Mat 26:31 = disciples skandalizo'd when shepherd smitten. John 16:1 = Jesus warns "that ye should not be skandalizo'd." Pattern: external pressure → internal trap activates → covenant departure. Key: same root as "stumbling block" (skandalon). Rom 9:33/1Pet 2:8 Christ himself = skandalon to unbelievers. Needs full exhaustive study.
