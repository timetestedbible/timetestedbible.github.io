symbol: man-of-sin
name: MAN OF SIN / LAWLESS ONE
strongs: [G266, G458, G459, G684, G646, G500]
words: ["man of sin", "son of perdition", "that Wicked", "lawless one", "antichrist", "mystery of iniquity"]
role: structural-pattern
meaning: The recurring pattern of lawlessness incarnated in covenant-usurping authority — already active as hidden 'mystery,' manifesting in each era's false authority, culminating in a final personal revelation destroyed by Christ's return
opposite: CHRIST — the faithful covenant-keeping authority who sits at God's right hand by invitation, not usurpation (Ps 110:1, Heb 1:3)

## Winning Interpretation
C7: Pattern-to-person embodiment. G266→G458→G459 progression: abstract sin → structural lawlessness → incarnated lawless one. "Mystery already works" (v7) + future "revealing" (v3) = same principle, different phases.

## Lexical Chain
G266 hamartia "SIN" → G458 anomia "INIQUITY/LAWLESSNESS" → G459 anomos "LAWLESS ONE"
Progression: abstract condition → structural operation → personal embodiment
G684 apoleia "perdition" — only used of Judas (John 17:12), man of sin (2Thess 2:3), beast (Rev 17:8,11)
G684 links all three: betrayal-from-within-covenant-space principle
G646 apostasia "falling away" — fem. of apostasion (divorce document) = covenant departure first

## Mystery Connection
G3466 mysterion: 2Thess 2:7 "mystery of iniquity" || Rev 17:5 "MYSTERY, BABYLON"
Same hidden principle: man's self-ruling authority replacing God's covenant order

## Individual + System = Both/And
2Thess 2: singular personal language → PERSON in final form
1John 2:18 "many antichrists" + 1John 4:3 "spirit already in world" → PRINCIPLE with multiple expressions
Rev 13 beast: seven heads on one body → system IS succession of persons
Resolution: final personal incarnation of principle operating through many persons/systems historically

## Daniel Parallels
All share: (1) self-exaltation vs God (2) persecute saints (3) bounded by divine timetable (4) destroyed by divine action
Dan 8:24 "not by his own power" = 2Thess 2:9 "after working of Satan"
Dan 8:25 "broken without hand" = 2Thess 2:8 "destroyed with brightness of His coming"

## 42-Month Pattern
Rev 13:5 "42 months" = Dan 7:25 "time,times,½time" = Dan 12:7 = Rev 11:2,12:6,14
Bounded duration marker appears 7× across Daniel-Revelation → same event-window

## Abomination = Man of Sin
Mark 13:14 masculine participle hestekota "standing" → abomination personified
2Thess 2:4 "sitteth in temple" = Mark 13:14 "standing where ought not"
Man of sin IS personal abomination of desolation → counterfeit authority in God's covenant place

## Restrainer Pattern
G2722 katecho: v6 neuter "to katechon" (restraining thing/force) + v7 masculine "ho katechon" (person)
Both system + person. "Ye know" = Thessalonians knew identity
STRUCTURAL POINT: lawlessness already present but held back. Removal unveils, doesn't create

## Fulfillment Types
Antiochus IV: self-exalted ✓ persecuted ✓ changed worship ✓ "broken without hand" ✓ But Dan 11:35 → "time of end" = TYPE
Roman Emperors: claimed divinity ✓ persecuted church ✓ "mystery works" in Paul's day ✓ But not destroyed by Christ's return = TYPE
1John "many antichrists": false teachers ✓ "went out from us" = apostasia ✓ Multiple expressions = PARTIAL
Final 2Thess 2:8: "destroyed by brightness of His coming" → tied to RETURN OF CHRIST = UNFULFILLED

## Convergence
Man of sin = abomination of desolation = beast (Rev 13) = little horn (Dan 7)
Same pattern, different angles: moral/cultic/political/theological
All converge: (1) self-exaltation (2) covenant-space invasion (3) saint-persecution (4) bounded duration (5) divine termination at Christ's return

## Roadmap Touches
(1) RAPTURE: 2Thess 2:1 "gathering together" = immediate context. Apostasia + revealing come first
(2) RETURN OF CHRIST: destroyed by His appearing
(3) FALL OF BABYLON: system generating pattern collapses
(4) SUDDEN DESTRUCTION: "whom Lord shall consume"
