[H784] esh = 549× OT. Derivatives: [H799] eshdat "fire-law" Deut 33:2, [H801] ishshâh burnt-offering = "fire-thing"
[H217] ur = flame/East. → [H221-224] Uri/Uriel/Urijah/Urim — fire→light→revelation chain
[G4442] pur = 73× NT. Key: [G4451] pýrōsis = smelting + conflagration AS TEST (same word, dual outcome)
[H6884] tsaraph = refine/fuse metal (Mal 3:2-3, Zech 13:9). [H1614] gophrith = brimstone (always + judgment)

Core meaning: God's covenant standard in active contact. Same fire → refining (genuine material) || destruction (counterfeit)
God IS consuming fire Deut 4:24 = Heb 12:29. Word like fire Jer 23:29. Law = fire-law Deut 33:2
1Cor 3:13-15 DEFINING: same fire tests all works. Gold/silver/stones survive. Wood/hay/stubble consumed. Builder saved "yet so as by fire"

DUAL FUNCTION — SAME FIRE:
A) JUDGMENT: Sodom Gen 19:24, strange fire Lev 10:1-2, chaff Matt 3:12, tares Matt 13:42, lake of fire Rev 20:15
B) REFINING: sons of Levi Mal 3:2-3, third part Zech 13:9, faith 1Pet 1:7, Isaiah's lips Isa 6:6-7
C) THEOPHANY: burning bush Exod 3:2, Sinai Exod 19:18, throne Dan 7:9, Christ's eyes Rev 1:14
D) WORD AS FIRE: Jer 23:29, 5:14, 20:9, Deut 33:2, Rev 11:5
E) WICKEDNESS MIMICS FIRE: burns like fire Isa 9:18, tongue = fire Jas 3:6 (counterfeit consuming)

Dan 3: same furnace → soldiers die vs Hebrew boys unharmed + "Son of God" walking IN fire
Exod 3: bush burned but NOT consumed. Holy material withstands standard
Mal 3:2-3 + 4:1: SAME DAY → refiner's fire (Levi) || oven fire (wicked stubble)

Fire + brimstone = self-sustaining judgment: Gen 19:24 → Luke 17:29 → Rev 19:20 → Rev 20:10 → Rev 21:8
2Pet 3:5-7: water (Noah) → fire (end). "Same word" reserves present heavens for fire. Elements melt G4451 pýrōsis

Anomalies: Rev 13:13 false prophet mimics God's fire. Luke 12:49 Christ sends fire (already kindled)
Cross-testament: H784 → LXX G4442. Deut 4:24 = Heb 12:29 exact quote. Mal 3:2 refining → 1Pet 1:7

PATTERN SUMMARY:
Fire = covenant standard applied. Outcome depends on material, not fire
Standard separates at gathering, returns with Christ, destroys Babylon suddenly
Water judgment (Noah) escalated to fire judgment (end) — we're in "reserved for fire" era
Same fire refines remnant while consuming rebellion — purification ≠ punishment
