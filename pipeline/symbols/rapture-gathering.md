## Context Bag

**H6908 (qabats):** Gather/assemble. BDB: collect, assemble people. LXX renders → G4863 (sunagō) predominantly. Core pattern: God gathers scattered Israel FROM nations BACK to land after exile-judgment. Deu 30:3-4 (covenant restoration after curse); Isa 11:12 (gather dispersed from FOUR WINDS); Isa 56:8 (gathers outcasts); Jer 31:8-10 (gather from ends of earth); Eze 36:24; 37:21 (gather from nations→own land); Zep 3:8 (gather NATIONS for judgment); Mic 4:12 (nations gathered like SHEAVES to threshing floor—God gathers enemies FOR judgment). Dual use: gathers His own for restoration, gathers enemies for destruction.

**H622 (asaph):** Gather in, remove, withdraw. BDB: harvest ingathering, also "gather to fathers"=death. LXX → G4863, G1523. Gen 49:33 (Jacob gathered to his people=death). Exo 23:16 (Feast of INGATHERING—Sukkot). Num 12:14-15 (Miriam gathered back after exclusion). Isa 4:1 (gather reproach). Jdg 19:15,18 (no one gathered them in=hospitality). Pattern: harvest-completion, covenant feast cycle, removal/death.

**G1997 (episunagōgē):** Only 2× in NT. 2Th 2:1 (our GATHERING to Him—paired with RETURN OF CHRIST, preceded by FALLING AWAY + man of WICKEDNESS). Heb 10:25 (assembling together—covenant community gathering, near DAY approaching). Compound: epi+sun+agō = gathering-upon-together. Both contexts: covenant accountability, DAY approaching.

**G726 (harpazō):** Seize, snatch, catch up. 1Th 4:17 (caught up in CLOUDS to meet Lord—TRUMPET, EAGLE-voice, SLEEP/death). Mat 11:12 (violent take kingdom by force). Jhn 10:28-29 (no one snatches from hand). Act 8:39 (Philip snatched away). 2Co 12:2-4 (caught up to third heaven). Rev 12:5 (MAN CHILD caught up to God's throne). Pattern: forceful removal/transfer—God's sovereign seizure.

**CLUSTER:** Occurrences cluster around: (1) Post-exile covenant restoration (H6908 dominant); (2) Eschatological DAY/judgment (G1997+G726); (3) Agricultural harvest-completion feast (H622→Sukkot). All three converge: God's end-of-cycle ingathering.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Gathering = covenant ingathering. God scattered for covenant violation (Lev 26:33); God regathers when covenant is renewed (Deu 30:1-5). Every instance: separation-from-nations + return-to-God's-presence.

**SEALING PRECONDITION:** Rev 7:1-4 = servants sealed BEFORE four winds/horsemen can harm earth/sea/trees. The sealing is the PRECONDITION for judgment to begin, not just protection during it. "Hurt not... TILL we have sealed." Sequential: seal FIRST → winds released → birth pains begin → testimony period → gathering at trumpet.

**APANTESIS DIRECTION (G529):** 1Th 4:17 "caught up... to MEET (eis apantesin) the Lord in the air." G529 = technical civic-escort term: citizens go OUT to meet arriving dignitary, then escort Him BACK IN to His destination. Acts 28:15 demonstrates: brethren went out to meet Paul → escorted him INTO Rome, not away from it. Mat 25:6 virgins go out to meet bridegroom → he enters the feast. The gathering is an escort TOWARD earth (the King's destination), not departure FROM it.

**ORDERING RELATIVE TO BABYLON'S FALL:** Rev 18:4 "come out of her my people" = extraction from Babylon. Rev 17:16 ten horns destroy Babylon. The extraction precedes the system's self-destruction. Then: trumpet (Rev 11:15) → kingdom transfer → gathering (Mat 24:31). The gathering is the CULMINATION after Babylon falls, not an escape before judgment begins.

**ANOMALIES:** Zep 3:8/Mic 4:12—God gathers NATIONS (enemies) for destruction, not restoration. Same word, opposite recipients. Judgment-gathering vs. salvation-gathering share mechanism: God initiates both.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H6908→LXX G4863 (sunagō)→NT G1997 (episunagōgē). Direct morphological chain. "Synagogue" derives from same root—the gathered assembly IS the covenant community. G726 (harpazō) stands separate—forceful seizure aspect absent from H6908/H622. NT adds violence/urgency dimension.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H622 (asaph) links INGATHERING FEAST (Sukkot) to death ("gathered to fathers") to harvest-completion. This triple meaning invisible in Greek. Sukkot = 7th month = completion = final harvest = dwelling with God. The "rapture" IS the feast of ingathering fulfilled.
