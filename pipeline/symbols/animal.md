## Context Bag

**EXPLICIT DEF**: Acts 10:11-15 → Peter's vision: vessel w/ unclean ANIMALS descends; Acts 10:28 → GOD INTERPRETS: "not call any MAN common/unclean." Unclean animals = Gentile men; clean animals = covenant peoples. ANIMAL → PEOPLE explicitly.

**POSITIONAL HIERARCHY** + TREE: Dan 4:12,21 → beasts dwell UNDER the tree. TREE → empire (Babylon); ANIMAL → subordinate peoples/tribes dwelling under empire's shadow. When TREE + ANIMAL co-occur, spatial relation resolves overlap: TREE = dominant structure, ANIMAL = subordinate characterized people.

**CHARACTERIZATION — Gen 49 tribes**: Each tribe → specific animal revealing nature/character. Gen 49:9 Judah → LION (royal, dominant, courageous). Gen 49:14 Issachar → DONKEY (strong, burden-bearing). Gen 49:17 Dan → SERPENT (subtle, cunning). Gen 49:21 Naphtali → HIND/DEER (swift, free). Gen 49:27 Benjamin → WOLF (ravenous, dividing prey). Specific animal type → CHARACTER of that people-group.

**CLEAN vs UNCLEAN** (Acts 10): Clean animals → covenant peoples || Unclean animals → peoples outside covenant. Acts 10:15 "What God hath cleansed, call not common" → Gentiles brought into covenant = formerly unclean now cleansed.

**WILD vs DOMESTIC**: Wild (lion, bear, wolf, leopard) → predatory/aggressive peoples. Domestic (sheep, ox, donkey) → servile/productive/vulnerable peoples.

**PROPHETIC KINGDOMS** (Dan 7): Lion → Babylon; Bear → Medo-Persia; Leopard → Greece; Dreadful beast → Rome. Note: In Dan 7 beasts = dominant kingdoms (no TREE present); when paired w/ TREE (Dan 4), animals = SUBORDINATE peoples. Context determines hierarchical level.

**BEASTS + SEA**: Rev 13:1 → beast rises FROM the sea. SEA → chaotic peoples; beast emerges from nations.

**TWO DIMENSIONS**: (1) IS → people-group/tribe (subj: collective characterized by nature, subordinate to empires/TREE); (2) DOES → acts according to nature (specific animal reveals character/behavior of that people).

**CO-SYMBOL RELATIONS**: ANIMAL under TREE (Dan 4) || ANIMAL from SEA (Rev 13:1) || ANIMAL within BABYLON system || SHEEP as domestic animal → God's people specifically.
