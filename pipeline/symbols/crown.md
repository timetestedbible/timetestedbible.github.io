**G1238 diadema** (διάδημα) — from G1223 dia + G1210 deo (to bind). A diadem bound about the head. KJV: crown. **Inherent royal sovereignty** — not earned but possessed by right of rule.

**H5850 atarah** (עֲטָרָה) — from H5849 atar (to encircle for attack or protection; to crown). KJV: crown. **General-purpose crown** — can be glory, beauty, pride, or shame depending on who wears it.

**H3804 kether** (כֶּתֶר) — from H3803 kathar (to enclose; in friendly sense: crown; in hostile: besiege). Properly a circlet, diadem. KJV: crown. **Royal Persian crown** — only in Esther; imperial authority.

**H5145 nezer** (נֶזֶר) — from H5144 nazar (to hold aloof, set apart, consecrate). Something set apart: dedication, unshorn locks, chaplet of royalty. KJV: consecration, crown, hair, separation. **Consecration-crown** — priestly/Nazirite separation made visible; authority derived from holiness, not combat or politics.

### G4735 STEPHANOS — 18 NT occurrences, 4 clusters:

**Cluster 1 — Crown of thorns (mockery → inversion):** Mt 27:29, Mk 15:17, Jn 19:2,5 — soldiers plait stephanos of thorns on Jesus' head. Intended as mockery → actually prophetic enthronement: the victor's wreath IS thorns. co: THORNS, PURPLE, REED. King crowned by suffering, not conquest.

**Cluster 2 — Promised reward-crowns:** 1Cor 9:25 — corruptible stephanos (athletic games) vs incorruptible (believer's endurance). 2Tim 4:8 — stephanos of righteousness at "that day." Jas 1:12 / Rev 2:10 — stephanos of life promised to those enduring trial unto death. 1Pet 5:4 — stephanos of glory at chief Shepherd's appearing. Phil 4:1 / 1Th 2:19 — believers ARE Paul's stephanos. Pattern: stephanos = reward for completed contest → future tense, eschatological.

**Cluster 3 — Heavenly holders:** Rev 4:4 — 24 elders wear golden stephanoi. Rev 4:10 — they CAST stephanoi before throne → authority returned to source. Rev 12:1 — woman clothed with sun wears stephanos of 12 stars → Israel/bride-figure crowned with tribal/apostolic authority. Rev 14:14 — Son of Man on cloud with golden stephanos + sickle → harvest-authority.

**Cluster 4 — Counterfeit/contested crowns:** Rev 6:2 — white horse rider: stephanos "was given" (G1325 passive) to him + bow → delegated/granted authority, not inherent. Conquers but crown is received, not possessed. Rev 9:7 — locusts had "as it were" (G5613 hos) crowns "LIKE" (G3664 homoios) gold → double qualifier: not actual crowns, not actual gold. Counterfeit authority. co: LOCUST, HORSE, BATTLE. Rev 3:11 — "hold fast that no man take thy stephanos" → stephanos can be LOST or stolen. ≠ diadema (intrinsic).

### G1238 DIADEMA — 3 occurrences, all Revelation:

Rev 12:3 — dragon: 7 heads, 7 diademata on heads → claimed sovereign authority (usurped). Rev 13:1 — beast from sea: 10 horns, 10 diademata on horns → authority distributed across political power-centers. Dragon's diademata on heads (identity); beast's on horns (force). Rev 19:12 — Christ: MANY (G4183 polus) diademata → intrinsic sovereignty exceeding all others combined. Eyes as flame, name unknown → authority beyond count or comprehension. Pattern: diadema = sovereign rule by nature. Dragon/beast CLAIM it; Christ POSSESSES it. Stephanos is earned → can be given/taken. Diadema is inherent → reveals who the ruler IS.

### H5850 ATARAH — 23 OT occurrences, 4 clusters:

**Cluster 1 — Spoils/transferred authority:** 2Sam 12:30 / 1Chr 20:2 — Ammonite king's crown taken, set on David's head. Weight: talent of gold + precious stones. Authority transferred by conquest.

**Cluster 3 — Divine crowning/glory:** Ps 21:3 — crown of pure gold on king's head (messianic). Isa 28:5 — LORD himself becomes crown of glory to remnant (contrast: Isa 28:1,3 — crown of pride = Ephraim's drunkards → fading flower → trampled).

SoS 3:11 — Solomon's crown from his mother at wedding.

**Cluster 4 — Crown removed/fallen:** Job 19:9 — "taken crown from my head" = glory stripped. Jer 13:18 — "crown of your glory shall come down" (king + queen). Lam 5:16 — "crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!" Ezek 21:26 — "remove the diadem, take off the crown" → neither high nor low remains → total reset. Ezek 23:42 — harlot-sisters with crowns → prostituted authority. Zech 6:11,14 — crowns placed on Joshua the high priest → priestly-royal merger, memorial in temple.

### H3804 KETHER — 3 occurrences (Esther only):

Est 1:11 — Vashti summoned with kether royal → refused to display it → deposed. Est 2:17 — kether royal set on Esther's head → replacement queen. Est 6:8 — kether described as what king wears + horse he rides. Persian imperial crown = political sovereignty within pagan empire. Esther wears it → covenant woman inside Babylon-system wearing Babylon's crown.

### H5145 NEZER — 24 occurrences, 3 clusters:

**Cluster 1 — Priestly holy crown:** Ex 29:6, 39:30, Lev 8:9 — golden plate = "holy crown" (nezer) on high priest's mitre. Inscribed "HOLINESS TO THE LORD." Lev 21:12 — "crown of anointing oil of his God upon him" → priest cannot leave sanctuary or profane it. Nezer = visible consecration.

**Cluster 2 — Nazirite consecration:** Num 6:4-21 — nezer used 10× in Nazirite law. Means "separation/consecration" not crown-as-object. The Nazirite's uncut hair IS the nezer → the person's body becomes the crown. Defilement (corpse-contact) breaks the nezer → must restart. Hair burned in sacrifice-fire at completion.

**Cluster 3 — Royal/covenant nezer:** 2Sam 1:10 — nezer taken from Saul's head by Amalekite (crown + bracelet → royal insignia). 2Ki 11:12 / 2Chr 23:11 — nezer placed on Joash + given testimony → coronation includes BOTH crown AND law. Ps 89:39 — "profaned his nezer to the ground" → covenant crown defiled. Ps 132:18 — "upon himself shall his nezer flourish." Prov 27:24 — "doth the nezer endure to every generation?" Jer 7:29 — "cut off thine nezer (hair/consecration)" = break your Nazirite separation → mourning-command. Zech 9:16 — "stones of a nezer lifted as ensign" → people themselves become crown-jewels.

**PATTERN SYNTHESIS — FIVE CROWNS, FIVE AUTHORITY-TYPES:**

| Word | Source | Can be lost? | Agents |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| stephanos | Earned/awarded | YES (Rev 3:11) | Believers, 24 elders, locusts (counterfeit) |
| diadema | Inherent sovereignty | NO (possessed by nature) | Christ (many), dragon (7), beast (10) |
| atarah | Bestowed/relational | YES (Lam 5:16) | Kings, wives, wisdom, God himself |
| kether | Imperial appointment | YES (Est 1:11) | Persian royalty, Esther |
| nezer | Consecration/holiness | YES (if defiled) | Priests, Nazirites, kings (with testimony) |

**KEY THEOLOGICAL PATTERN:** Rev 6:2 white horse rider receives (passive) a stephanos → delegated authority, earned in contest. Rev 9:7 locusts have crowns "LIKE" gold → double-fake: not real crowns, not real gold → counterfeit authority over counterfeit territory. Rev 19:12 Christ wears MANY diademata → not awarded, not delegated, not consecrated — simply IS sovereign. The crown-type reveals the authority-source: stephanos tests whether you earned it; diadema reveals whether you ARE it. Dragon/beast wear diadema (claiming inherent right to rule); Christ wears diadema (actually possessing it) AND in Rev 14:14 stephanos (having also EARNED it through suffering — crown of thorns). Only Christ holds both crown-types simultaneously.

**CROWN + THORNS intersection:** Jesus' stephanos of thorns (Mt 27:29) = the curse of Gen 3:18 woven into a victor's wreath. Crown of thorns = authority earned THROUGH the curse, not despite it. Thorns (judgment on earth) become the material of coronation.
