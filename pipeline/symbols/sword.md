**H2719 chereb** = drought + cutting. Root **H2717 charab** = parch/desolate/destroy
**H2722 Choreb** = Horeb/Sinai (same root). Covenant-place → judgment-instrument share etymology
Sword's name = desolation-maker. Not just cuts — WASTES

Isa 34:5 — Sword **bathed** [H7301 ravah] in **heaven** [H8064 shamayim] → down on **cherem** people
H7301 = saturate/soak/DWELL IN. Not pass through — soaked in sky
H8064 = sky/atmosphere/space. Physical dimension
H2764 cherem = devoted to utter destruction. Most severe covenant judgment

Trajectory: UP → saturated in space → DOWN. Only ICBMs/hypersonics match profile
Ancient weapons ≠ "dwell" in sky. Modern ballistics spend majority flight in space
Isa 34:4 — heavens roll like scroll THEN sword descends (atmospheric displacement → impact)

**Cherem protocol:** Josh 6:17 Jericho || 1 Sam 15:3 Amalekites || Deut 7:2 Canaanites
Mal 4:6 — threatens EARTH with cherem (OT final word)
Zech 14:11 — "no more cherem" in restored Jerusalem
Chain: Mal 4:6 → Isa 34:5 → Zech 5:3 → Rev 18 total destruction

Gen 3:24 — **Flaming sword** H3858 lahat (blaze + enwrap) + H2015 haphak (transform/overturn)
First weapon: fire-wrapped + desolation-making + overturning. Blocks self-salvation

Sword + Fire co-occur: Josh 11:11 || Judg 1:8 || Judg 18:27 || Judg 20:48 || Ezek 23:25,47
Sword ≠ just cut — BURNS. Produces fire consistently

Rev 19:15 — Sword from mouth = Word executing judgment (cf. Heb 4:12)
Rev 19:13 — "Word of God" + v15 winepress = Word = sword = fire

Isa 34 sequence: nations summoned → cherem on all → mountains melt → heavens roll → sword descends
Result: streams → pitch, dust → brimstone, unquenchable fire, perpetual smoke
Compare: 2 Pet 3:10 elements melt || Rev 18:9 smoke || Rev 14:11 eternal torment

Mat 24:4-8 — Jesus substituted earthquake for sword in Jeremiah triad
Sword enters v9, escalates through vv21-22. Early = structural violence, later = personal

Isa 34:13 — THORNS in palaces after cherem-sword-fire judgment
Worldly cursed people overrun ruins post-destruction

**Pattern:** Cherem (total destruction) delivered by sword bathed in heaven → fire/brimstone → smoke forever
Modern weapon profile: space-trajectory + devastating impact + fire effects + lasting consequences
