## Context Bag

**ROOT CHAIN:** H2717 charab (parch/desolate) → H2719 chereb (sword = drought-instrument) = H2721 choreb (drought, "collateral form of H2719") = H2722 Choreb (Horeb = "desolation"). H2723 chorbah (ruin). Sword's NAME = desolation-maker. Same root names the covenant mountain. H2719 also = axe, dagger, knife, mattock, tool — any cutting instrument of destructive effect.

G3162 = physical + spiritual: arrest scene (Matt 26:47-52), state authority (Rom 13:4), Word of God (Eph 6:17, Heb 4:12), 2nd horseman red (Rev 6:4), beast-wound (Rev 13:10,14).

**PATTERNS:**
1. ROOT=DESOLATION: Every H2717 derivative = drought/ruin/desert. Sword doesn't just cut — WASTES.
2. COVENANT INSTRUMENT: Makes covenant (circumcision Josh 5) AND breaks it (Lev 26). Root = covenant-mountain.
3. TRIAD: sword+famine+pestilence = violence + Word-withdrawal + death-consequence. ~30× Jer, ~10× Ezek.
4. FIRE FUSION: sword+fire co-occur Josh 11:11, Judg 1:8, 18:27, 20:48, Isa 34, 66:16. Gen 3:24 = flaming sword. The desolation-maker produces fire.
5. SWORDS↔PLOWSHARES: Isa 2:4/Mic 4:3 (peace) ↔ Joel 3:10 (war). Reversal marks era change.
6. DIVINE OWNERSHIP→WORD: God wields (Deut 32:41, Isa 34:5, Ezek 21:3-5) → turns on Son (Zech 13:7) → executes by mouth-Word (Rev 19:15). The spoken covenant standard IS the sword (Heb 4:12 + Eph 6:17 + Rev 19:15).
