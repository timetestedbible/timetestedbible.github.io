## Context Bag

**"GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM" — exact phrase (G2098 + G932 together, 5×):**
Mat 4:23 — subj: Jesus. co: teaching (G1321 didasko) + healing (G2323 therapeuo). role: triple ministry = teach+herald+heal. "All Galilee" = regional scope. cycle: Ministry launch.
Mat 9:35 — subj: Jesus. co: teaching + healing. role: IDENTICAL formula to 4:23. "All the cities and villages" = intensified scope. Bookends (inclusio) around Mat 5-9 ministry content.
**Mat 24:14** — subj: this gospel of the kingdom. co: kerusso (G2784 herald) + oikoumene (G3625 inhabited world) + marturion (G3142 testimony) + ethnos (G1484 nations) + telos (G5056 end). DEFINING VERSE. Five-element chain: (1) this specific gospel, (2) heralded, (3) in all oikoumene, (4) for a marturion, (5) THEN (tote G5119) the telos comes. The preaching-completion IS the trigger-condition for the end.
Mk 1:14 — subj: Jesus. co: John imprisoned (paradidomi G3860 = same "betray" verb as Mat 24:10). role: John's arrest = gospel-of-kingdom launches. Persecution of forerunner triggers kingdom-proclamation.
Mk 1:15 — subj: Jesus. co: time fulfilled (kairos G2540 + pleroo G4137), kingdom at hand (eggizo G1448), repent (metanoeo G3340), believe (pisteuo G4100) the gospel. role: first content of the gospel = time-fullness + kingdom-nearness + repent + believe.

**G3142 marturion — testimony-as-evidence (key NT, 20×):**
Mat 8:4 / Mk 1:44 / Lk 5:14 — for a marturion to them (leper healed). Pattern: miraculous evidence → legal testimony.
Mat 10:18 — before governors+kings FOR MY SAKE → for a marturion to them+Gentiles. co: persecution (v17 scourge in synagogues). Persecution = delivery mechanism for marturion. SAME CONTEXT as Mat 24:9-14.
**Mat 24:14** — for a marturion (witness) unto all nations. Not mere announcement — LEGAL EVIDENCE presented to nations. The gospel-preaching = a deposition before the court of nations.
Mk 13:9 — for a marturion against them (before rulers). co: councils, synagogue-beatings. Luke parallel: "it shall turn to you for a marturion" (Lk 21:13). Persecution-context = testimony-context. They are the SAME event.
Acts 4:33 — great power → gave marturion of resurrection. co: grace, power (dunamis G1411). Resurrection-witness = the content.
2Tim 1:8 — not ashamed of marturion of our Lord, nor of prisoner. co: afflictions of the gospel (G4777 sumpatheo). Marturion + suffering = inseparable pair.
Rev 15:5 — temple of tabernacle of marturion in heaven opened. co: TEMPLE. The heavenly marturion = the Decalogue ark (same word for tabernacle of testimony in Acts 7:44 / Heb 3:5). The gospel-witness IS covenant-witness.

**G3141 marturia — testimony-as-evidence-given (key Revelation chain):**
Rev 1:2,9 — John bore witness of word of God + marturia of Jesus Christ. John in Patmos FOR (dia G1223) word of God + marturia of Jesus.
**Rev 6:9** — fifth seal: souls slain FOR (dia) word of God + marturia they held. co: altar (BLOOD), "how long?" (time). MARTYRDOM = holding the marturia. Slain witnesses under the altar.
**Rev 11:7** — when they shall have FINISHED (teleo G5055) their marturia, the beast from the abyss makes war, overcomes, kills them. CRITICAL: (1) teleo = same verb as Jn 19:30 "it is finished." (2) The beast CAN ONLY act AFTER the testimony is teleo'd (completed/paid in full). (3) Beast kills them = martyrdom. The marturia-completion triggers the beast's permission to act.
Rev 12:11 — overcame him by blood of Lamb + word of their marturia + loved not lives unto death. co: BLOOD, DEATH. Three-weapon victory: Lamb's blood + spoken testimony + martyrdom-willingness.
Rev 12:17 — dragon wroth with woman → war with remnant who keep commandments of God + have marturia of Jesus. co: DRAGON, SEED, COMMANDMENTS. The remnant = defined by TWO markers: commandments + testimony.
Rev 19:10 — marturia of Jesus IS the spirit of prophecy. co: PROPHECY. The testimony of Jesus = the animating force behind all prophecy.
**Rev 20:4** — beheaded FOR (dia) marturia of Jesus + word of God. co: THRONES, JUDGMENT, REIGN. Those who DIED for the testimony = those who REIGN. Marturia→martyrdom→authority. The cost IS the crown.

**G5055 teleo → G5056 telos CHAIN (the completion trigger):**
Mat 10:23 — ye shall not have teleo'd the cities of Israel till Son of Man comes. Preaching-to-Israel has a deadline tied to parousia.
Lk 12:50 — baptism to be baptized with; straitened till teleo'd. Jesus's own testimony has a "finish" point = the cross.
Jn 19:30 — "It is teleo'd" (tetelestai). The prototype: Jesus FINISHES his testimony, then dies. Pattern established: testimony-completion→death→resurrection→authority.
**Rev 10:7** — in days of 7th angel's voice, mystery of God should be teleo'd (finished), as declared (euangelizo G2097!) to his servants the prophets. The "good-news'd" mystery is FINISHED at the 7th trumpet. Same verb euangelizo = gospel root.
**Rev 11:7** — when they have teleo'd their marturia, beast from abyss kills them. 3.5 days dead → resurrection → ascend in cloud → 7th trumpet sounds (v15) → "kingdoms of this world are become kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ" (v15).

**CHAIN SYNTHESIS — Mat 24:14 → Rev 11:7 → Rev 10:7:**
Mat 24:14: gospel-of-kingdom kerusso'd in all oikoumene for marturion → THEN telos comes.
Rev 11:7: when marturia is teleo'd → beast kills witnesses → 3.5 days → resurrection → 7th trumpet.
Rev 10:7: at 7th trumpet → mystery of God teleo'd (as euangelizo'd to prophets).
The chain: marturion (Mat 24) → marturia (Rev 11) → teleo (Rev 11:7) → 7th trumpet → telos (Mat 24:14). The FINISHING of the witness IS the mechanism that triggers the end. Teleo (finish) → telos (end). Same root. The completion of testimony = the completion of the age.

**"Preaching the kingdom" — broader usage (8× without "gospel"):**
Lk 4:43 — "I MUST preach the kingdom of God to other cities; for therefore am I sent." co: PURPOSE (apostello = sent). Kingdom-preaching = the mission itself.
Lk 8:1 — preaching + showing glad tidings (euangelizo) of kingdom of God. Twelve with him.
Lk 9:2 — sent them to preach kingdom of God + heal. Delegation of the Mat 4:23/9:35 pattern.
Lk 9:60 — "let the dead bury their dead; go thou and preach the kingdom of God." co: DEATH, urgency. Kingdom-preaching supersedes death-obligations.
Acts 8:12 — Philip preaching things concerning kingdom of God + name of Jesus Christ. co: NAME. Kingdom + Name = inseparable pair post-resurrection.
Acts 20:25 — Paul: "ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God shall see my face no more." co: Paul's farewell. Paul understood his oikoumene circuit as kingdom-heralding.
**Acts 28:31** — Paul preaching kingdom of God in Rome, "with all confidence, no man forbidding." FINAL VERSE OF ACTS. Paul in Rome = gospel reached the capital of the oikoumene. Luke's narrative arc: Jerusalem → Rome = marturion-to-oikoumene progression.
**Rev 14:6** — angel with everlasting (aionios G166) gospel (euangelion) to preach to every nation+kindred+tongue+people. co: ANGEL, every ethnic unit. The final-scope gospel: angelic herald ensures every ethnos receives testimony. Parallels Mat 24:14 scope.

## THE GOSPEL PREACHED AT SINAI — AND BEFORE

**Heb 4:2** — "unto us was the gospel preached (G2097 euangelizo), AS WELL AS UNTO THEM (the Exodus generation)." The SAME verb (euangelizo) used for what happened at Sinai. What was preached? Ex 19:5-6 "ye shall be unto me a kingdom (H4467 mamlakah) of priests and a holy nation." The gospel of the KINGDOM — the announcement that God's covenant reign has arrived and you can be part of it — was preached at Sinai. Heb 4:2 continues: "the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with FAITH (G4102 pistis)" — and Heb 3:18-19 equates unbelief with disobedience. Same gospel, same response required (faith-as-obedience), same failure mode (unbelief).

**Gal 3:8** — "the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations through faith, preached before the gospel (G4283 proeuangelizo = PRE-GOSPELED) unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed." Abraham received the gospel BEFORE Sinai. The content: "in thee shall all nations be blessed" = the kingdom will extend to ALL NATIONS. Same scope as Mat 24:14 "all nations."

**This is NOT the post-cross "gospel about Jesus."** Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom BEFORE his death, burial, and resurrection (Mat 4:23, 9:35, Mk 1:14-15). It was preached at Sinai (Heb 4:2). It was preached to Abraham (Gal 3:8). The gospel of the kingdom = the herald-announcement that God's covenant reign has arrived. The death/burial/resurrection is the MECHANISM by which the kingdom is secured (Jn 19:30 "tetelestai" = the prototype teleo), but the GOSPEL is the kingdom announcement itself. The modern "gospel about Jesus" (believe in substitutionary atonement and go to heaven) is a SUBSET, not the whole. The whole gospel = God's kingdom has arrived, repent, believe, obey (Mk 1:15).

## Pattern Summary

**The gospel of the kingdom is not generic "good news" — it is the specific herald-announcement that God's covenant reign (basileia) has arrived, delivered as legal testimony (marturion) to the nations. It is the SAME gospel preached to Abraham (Gal 3:8), preached at Sinai (Heb 4:2), preached by Jesus before the cross (Mat 4:23), and preached to all nations before the end (Mat 24:14).**

**Six structural findings:**
1. **Trigger-condition for the end:** Mat 24:14 is not a prediction but a CONDITION. Telos cannot come UNTIL the marturion reaches all nations. The witness-completion IS the end-trigger. This inverts common reading: the gospel isn't racing against the clock — the clock doesn't START until the gospel finishes.
2. **Teleo→telos chain:** G5055 teleo (finish) derives from G5056 telos (end). Rev 11:7 "finished (teleo) their testimony" → Rev 10:7 "mystery of God finished (teleo)" → Mat 24:14 "then shall the end (telos) come." Three links: testimony-completion → mystery-completion → age-completion. Jn 19:30 "tetelestai" is the prototype: Jesus finished his testimony, died, rose. The witnesses repeat the pattern.
3. **Marturion→marturia→martus→martyr:** G3142 marturion (evidence-object) → G3141 marturia (evidence-given) → G3144 martus (the one giving evidence) → English "martyr." The semantic drift IS the theology: giving testimony costs your life. Mat 10:18 + Mk 13:9: persecution before rulers = testimony-context. Rev 6:9: slain for testimony held. Rev 12:11: overcame by testimony + loved not lives unto death. Rev 20:4: beheaded for testimony → reign with Christ. The witness IS the martyr. The death IS the delivery.
4. **Triple-ministry structure:** Mat 4:23 and 9:35 establish: teach (didasko) + herald (kerusso) + heal (therapeuo). The gospel of the kingdom isn't just a message — it's a ministry-triad. Teaching conveys content, heralding proclaims authority, healing demonstrates power. All three together = the kingdom arriving. Post-resurrection: Acts 28:31 retains teaching+preaching but healing is absorbed into resurrection-witness (Acts 4:33).
5. **Beast acts ONLY after testimony finishes:** Rev 11:7 — the beast from the abyss CANNOT kill the witnesses until their testimony is teleo'd. The witness-period is PROTECTED. Only completion of the appointed testimony opens the door to the beast's assault. This mirrors Mat 26:31 — Jesus wasn't arrested until he declared "all ye shall be skandalizo'd" (testimony finished → persecution released). Pattern: protected witness → testimony-completion → persecution/death → resurrection → authority.

**Convergence with SKANDALIZO:** Mat 24:9-14 is a unified sequence: persecution (v9) → skandalizo (v10) → false prophets/DECEIVE (v11) → WICKEDNESS multiplies (v12) → endurance = salvation (v13) → gospel-of-kingdom testimony completed (v14) → THEN the end. Skandalizo is the COST of the marturion. The pressure that causes the rootless to fall is the SAME pressure that refines the faithful into witnesses. Dan 11:33-35 confirms: the wise instruct many AND fall by sword — stumbling purifies to the time of the end.
