## Definitions

- **G2098 euangelion** — "a good message, i.e. the gospel." From G2097 euangelizo (to announce good news), from G2095 eu (well) + G32 aggelos (messenger). KJV: "gospel." 77 NT occurrences.

## Context Bag

**Exact phrase "gospel of the kingdom" (5×):**
Mat 4:23 — subj: Jesus. co: teaching+healing. Triple ministry: teach+herald+heal. "All Galilee." Inclusio with Mat 9:35 (bookends Mat 5-9).
Mat 9:35 — IDENTICAL formula. "All cities and villages" = intensified scope.
Mat 24:14 — DEFINING. co: kerusso(G2784)+oikoumene(G3625)+marturion(G3142)+ethnos(G1484)+telos(G5056). Five-element chain: (1) this gospel, (2) heralded, (3) all oikoumene, (4) for marturion, (5) THEN telos. Preaching-completion = trigger for the end.
Mk 1:14 — subj: Jesus. co: John imprisoned (paradidomi = same "betray" verb as Mat 24:10). Persecution of forerunner → kingdom-proclamation launches.
Mk 1:15 — First content: kairos fulfilled + kingdom at hand + repent + believe.

**G3142 marturion — testimony-as-evidence:**
Mat 8:4 / Mk 1:44 / Lk 5:14 — for marturion (healed leper). Miraculous evidence → legal testimony.
Mat 10:18 — before governors+kings for marturion. co: persecution. Persecution = delivery mechanism. = Mat 24:9-14.
Mat 24:14 — marturion unto all nations = LEGAL EVIDENCE, not mere announcement.
Mk 13:9 / Lk 21:13 — marturion before rulers. Persecution-context = testimony-context = SAME event.
Acts 4:33 — great power → marturion of resurrection. Content = resurrection-witness.
2Tim 1:8 — marturion + suffering = inseparable pair.
Rev 15:5 — tabernacle of marturion opened = Decalogue ark (Acts 7:44). Gospel-witness IS covenant-witness.

**G3141 marturia — Revelation chain:**
Rev 1:2,9 — John in Patmos FOR word of God + marturia of Jesus.
Rev 6:9 — 5th seal: souls slain FOR marturia. co: altar, BLOOD. Martyrdom = holding the marturia.
Rev 11:7 — CRITICAL: when marturia FINISHED (teleo G5055 = Jn 19:30), beast from abyss kills them. Beast CANNOT act until testimony completed. Completion triggers beast's permission.
Rev 12:11 — overcame by (1) Lamb's blood + (2) word of marturia + (3) loved not lives unto death.
Rev 12:17 — remnant = commandments of God + marturia of Jesus. co: DRAGON.
Rev 19:10 — marturia of Jesus IS spirit of prophecy.
Rev 20:4 — beheaded FOR marturia → REIGN. Cost IS the crown. co: THRONES.

**G5055 teleo → G5056 telos CHAIN:**
Mat 10:23 — not teleo'd cities of Israel till Son of Man comes. Deadline tied to parousia.
Jn 19:30 — "tetelestai." Prototype: testimony-completion→death→resurrection→authority.
Rev 10:7 — at 7th trumpet, mystery of God teleo'd (as euangelizo'd to prophets). Same verb euangelizo.
Rev 11:7 — marturia teleo'd → beast kills → 3.5 days dead → resurrection → 7th trumpet (v15) → "kingdoms become our Lord's."
**CHAIN**: marturion (Mat 24) → marturia (Rev 11) → teleo (Rev 11:7) → 7th trumpet → telos (Mat 24:14). Finishing witness = mechanism triggering end. Teleo→telos = same root.

**"Preaching the kingdom" (8× without "gospel"):**
Lk 4:43 — "MUST preach kingdom to other cities; therefore sent." Mission-definition.
Lk 8:1, 9:2 — preaching+healing delegated. Lk 9:60 — supersedes death-obligations.
Acts 8:12 — kingdom of God + NAME of Jesus = inseparable pair post-resurrection.
Acts 20:25 — Paul's oikoumene circuit as kingdom-heralding.
Acts 28:31 — FINAL VERSE OF ACTS. Paul in Rome = gospel reached oikoumene capital. Jerusalem→Rome arc.
Rev 14:6 — angel with everlasting gospel to every nation+kindred+tongue+people. co: ANGEL. = Mat 24:14 scope.

## THE GOSPEL PREACHED AT SINAI — AND BEFORE

**Heb 4:2** — "unto us was the gospel preached (G2097 euangelizo), AS WELL AS UNTO THEM (the Exodus generation)." The SAME verb (euangelizo) used for what happened at Sinai. What was preached? Ex 19:5-6 "ye shall be unto me a kingdom (H4467 mamlakah) of priests and a holy nation." The gospel of the KINGDOM — the announcement that God's covenant reign has arrived and you can be part of it — was preached at Sinai. Heb 4:2 continues: "the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with FAITH (G4102 pistis)" — and Heb 3:18-19 equates unbelief with disobedience. Same gospel, same response required (faith-as-obedience), same failure mode (unbelief).

**Gal 3:8** — "the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations through faith, preached before the gospel (G4283 proeuangelizo = PRE-GOSPELED) unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed." Abraham received the gospel BEFORE Sinai. The content: "in thee shall all nations be blessed" = the kingdom will extend to ALL NATIONS. Same scope as Mat 24:14 "all nations."

**This is NOT the post-cross "gospel about Jesus."** Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom BEFORE his death, burial, and resurrection (Mat 4:23, 9:35, Mk 1:14-15). It was preached at Sinai (Heb 4:2). It was preached to Abraham (Gal 3:8). The gospel of the kingdom = the herald-announcement that God's covenant reign has arrived. The death/burial/resurrection is the MECHANISM by which the kingdom is secured (Jn 19:30 "tetelestai" = the prototype teleo), but the GOSPEL is the kingdom announcement itself. The modern "gospel about Jesus" (believe in substitutionary atonement and go to heaven) is a SUBSET, not the whole. The whole gospel = God's kingdom has arrived, repent, believe, obey (Mk 1:15).

## Pattern Summary

**The gospel of the kingdom is not generic "good news" — it is the specific herald-announcement that God's covenant reign (basileia) has arrived, delivered as legal testimony (marturion) to the nations. It is the SAME gospel preached to Abraham (Gal 3:8), preached at Sinai (Heb 4:2), preached by Jesus before the cross (Mat 4:23), and preached to all nations before the end (Mat 24:14).**

**Six structural findings:**
1. **Trigger-condition for the end:** Mat 24:14 is not a prediction but a CONDITION. Telos cannot come UNTIL the marturion reaches all nations. The witness-completion IS the end-trigger. This inverts common reading: the gospel isn't racing against the clock — the clock doesn't START until the gospel finishes.
2. **Teleo→telos chain:** G5055 teleo (finish) derives from G5056 telos (end). Rev 11:7 "finished (teleo) their testimony" → Rev 10:7 "mystery of God finished (teleo)" → Mat 24:14 "then shall the end (telos) come." Three links: testimony-completion → mystery-completion → age-completion. Jn 19:30 "tetelestai" is the prototype: Jesus finished his testimony, died, rose. The witnesses repeat the pattern.
3. **Marturion→marturia→martus→martyr:** G3142 marturion (evidence-object) → G3141 marturia (evidence-given) → G3144 martus (the one giving evidence) → English "martyr." The semantic drift IS the theology: giving testimony costs your life. Mat 10:18 + Mk 13:9: persecution before rulers = testimony-context. Rev 6:9: slain for testimony held. Rev 12:11: overcame by testimony + loved not lives unto death. Rev 20:4: beheaded for testimony → reign with Christ. The witness IS the martyr. The death IS the delivery.
4. **Triple-ministry structure:** Mat 4:23 and 9:35 establish: teach (didasko) + herald (kerusso) + heal (therapeuo). The gospel of the kingdom isn't just a message — it's a ministry-triad. Teaching conveys content, heralding proclaims authority, healing demonstrates power. All three together = the kingdom arriving. Post-resurrection: Acts 28:31 retains teaching+preaching but healing is absorbed into resurrection-witness (Acts 4:33).
5. **Beast acts ONLY after testimony finishes:** Rev 11:7 — the beast from the abyss CANNOT kill the witnesses until their testimony is teleo'd. The witness-period is PROTECTED. Only completion of the appointed testimony opens the door to the beast's assault. This mirrors Mat 26:31 — Jesus wasn't arrested until he declared "all ye shall be skandalizo'd" (testimony finished → persecution released). Pattern: protected witness → testimony-completion → persecution/death → resurrection → authority.

**Convergence with SKANDALIZO:** Mat 24:9-14 is a unified sequence: persecution (v9) → skandalizo (v10) → false prophets/DECEIVE (v11) → WICKEDNESS multiplies (v12) → endurance = salvation (v13) → gospel-of-kingdom testimony completed (v14) → THEN the end. Skandalizo is the COST of the marturion. The pressure that causes the rootless to fall is the SAME pressure that refines the faithful into witnesses. Dan 11:33-35 confirms: the wise instruct many AND fall by sword — stumbling purifies to the time of the end.
