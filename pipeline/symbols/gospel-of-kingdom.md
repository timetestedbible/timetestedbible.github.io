## Context Bag

STUB — G2098 euangelion = good news; G932 basileia = kingdom/reign; G2784 kerusso = proclaim as herald; G3142 marturion = witness/testimony (same root as martys/martyr). Mat 24:14 makes gospel-completion THE condition for the end (telos). The preaching is "for a witness (marturion) to all nations" — legal testimony, not mere announcement. In persecution context (v9), witness = blood testimony = martyrdom. Rev 14:6 "everlasting gospel" preached by angel to every nation/kindred/tongue/people. Mat 4:23/9:35 Jesus preached "gospel of the kingdom" + healed — kingdom = God's covenant reign arriving. Acts 28:31 Paul preaching kingdom of God in Rome = oikoumene reached. Needs full study tracing euangelion + basileia + kerusso + marturion chains.
