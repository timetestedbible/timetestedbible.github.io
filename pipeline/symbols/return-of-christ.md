## Context Bag

**G3952 παρουσία (parousia):** 24 NT occ. Lit="presence/arrival." Used for royal visit. Matt24:3,27,37,39; 1Cor15:23; 1Thess2:19,3:13,4:15,5:23; 2Thess2:1,8,9; Jas5:7-8; 2Pet1:16,3:4,3:12; 1John2:28. Also used of man-of-sin's parousia (2Thess2:9)—counterfeit. LXX: rare; concept expressed via בּוֹא (bo) of YHWH. Compare Mal3:1-2 LXX ἔρχεται.

**G2015 ἐπιφάνεια (epiphaneia):** 6 occ. 2Thess2:8; 1Tim6:14; 2Tim1:10,4:1,4:8; Titus2:13. Lit="shining forth." LXX uses for God's visible intervention (2Sam7:23=ἐπιφάνεια; cf Esth5:1 LXX). Always paired w/ covenant obedience demands. 2Tim4:8 crown→those loving His epiphaneia=those keeping faith.

**G602 ἀποκάλυψις (apokalypsis):** 18 occ. Relevant: Rom8:19; 1Cor1:7; 2Thess1:7; 1Pet1:7,13,4:13; Rev1:1. Lit="uncovering." Hebrew parallel: גָּלָה (galah). Judgment=exposure; what was hidden made visible.

**CLUSTERING:** All three terms converge on SAME EVENT from different angles: parousia=arrival of King; epiphaneia=visible manifestation; apokalypsis=uncovering/exposure. Triple lens: political(arrival), optical(brightness), judicial(uncovering).

**KEY PATTERNS:**
- Matt24:27 lightning east→west = DAY/LIGHT symbol; sudden, total exposure
- Matt24:37-39 DAYS_OF_NOAH: eating/drinking = SLEEP/unaware; flood=SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION
- 1Thess4:15-5:4 parousia+trumpet+clouds→immediately "DAY of Lord"→thief in NIGHT→BIRTH_PAINS→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION; awake/SLEEP contrast
- 2Thess2:8 epiphaneia OF His parousia destroys lawless one=WICKEDNESS consumed by LIGHT
- 1Cor15:23 parousia=resurrection ORDER: firstfruits→those at His coming→THE_END
- Jas5:7-8 farmer waits early/late rain→parousia; FRUIT/patience=FAITH
- 2Pet3:4,12 scoffers deny parousia; fire+elements=EARTHQUAKE-level dissolution; DAY_AS_1000_YEARS context
- Rev1:7 comes w/ CLOUDS; every eye sees=apokalypsis; tribes mourn

**CONSISTENT READING:** Covenant King's decisive arrival-as-exposure. Every use demands covenant faithfulness NOW because this event = total accountability. Not merely "second coming" as future escape—it is the covenant mechanism that separates VIRGIN from HARLOT, LIGHT from DARKNESS, FAITH from WICKEDNESS. The "coming" IS the judgment.

**ANOMALIES:** 2Thess2:9 parousia of lawless one—counterfeit arrival; confirms parousia=royal-visit pattern (Satan mimics). 2Tim1:10 epiphaneia of incarnation—first appearing; shows epiphaneia spans both advents.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** Mal3:1-2 (YHWH suddenly comes to temple+refiner's fire)→Matt24; Zech14:4-5 (feet on Olives+EARTHQUAKE)→Acts1:11; Dan7:13-14 (Son of Man+CLOUDS+MOUNTAIN/kingdom)→Rev1:7. Hebrew בּוֹא+גָּלָה→Greek παρουσία+ἀποκάλυψις.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** Hebrew פָּקַד (paqad=visit/account) underlies parousia concept—God "visiting" always means reckoning. LXX ἐπισκοπή (1Pet2:12) related.
