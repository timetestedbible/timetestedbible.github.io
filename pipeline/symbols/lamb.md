## Context Bag

**LEXICAL:** G721 arnion = diminutive of G704 arén (lamb). 30× in NT, 29× in Revelation. Unique: John uses ONLY arnion in Revelation for Christ — the LITTLE lamb, the diminutive, emphasizing vulnerability-turned-sovereignty. G286 amnos = lamb (primary word). 4× only: John 1:29, 1:36, Acts 8:32, 1Pet 1:19. Used for sacrificial identification. H3532 kebes = from unused root "to dominate" — a ram just old enough to butt. Paradox in the root: the sacrificial lamb contains dominion. H7716 seh = generic flock member (sheep or goat). Broadest term — the one SET APART from the flock for sacrifice or identity.

**FOUR-WORD DISTINCTION:** H7716 seh = any flock animal (Gen 22:7, Exod 12:3, Isa 53:7). H3532 kebes = sacrificial lamb specifically (Exod 29:38, Lev 4:32, Num 28:3). G286 amnos = the Lamb identified and pointed to (John 1:29). G721 arnion = the Lamb enthroned and reigning (Rev 5:6+). Progression: generic→sacrificial→identified→glorified.

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**
Gen 22:7-8 — "where is the H7716 lamb?" / "God will provide himself a H7716 lamb." co: FIRE, WOOD, FIRSTBORN. Isaac asks; Abraham prophesies. The question spans Scripture → answered at Calvary.
Exod 12:3-5 — Passover lamb H7716, without blemish H8549, male, first year, taken from H3532 sheep or goats. Set apart 10th day, slain 14th. Blood on doorposts = death passes over. DEFINING: blood of lamb = exemption from judgment. co: BLOOD, FIRSTBORN, NIGHT, DEATH.
Isa 53:7 — "as a H7716 lamb to the slaughter" + "as a sheep before shearers is dumb." Lamb = silent submission. NOT passive weakness but deliberate choice to not open mouth. co: SUFFERING, SILENCE.
John 1:29 — "Behold the G286 amnos of God which G142 takes away sin of the world." Baptist points. Active removal, not just covering. co: SIN, WORLD. Definite article: THE Lamb, not A lamb.
John 1:36 — Second witness: "Behold the G286 amnos of God." Repetition = testimony established.
Acts 8:32 — Philip reads Isa 53:7 → G286 amnos dumb before shearer. Ethiopian asks "of whom?" co: GOSPEL, PROPHECY_FULFILLED.
1Pet 1:19 — "precious G129 blood of Christ, as of G286 amnos without blemish G299 and without spot G784." Passover lamb language applied to Christ directly. co: BLOOD, GOLD_SILVER (v18 not redeemed with corruptible things).

**REVELATION — ARNION DOMINANCE (29×):**
Rev 5:6 — Lamb G721 as slain G4969, seven horns (complete power) + seven eyes (complete knowledge) = seven Spirits. STANDING though slain. In MIDST of throne. co: THRONE, SEVEN, SPIRIT.
Rev 5:12 — "Worthy IS the Lamb slain to receive power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, glory, blessing." Seven-fold ascription. co: SEVEN-FOLD.
Rev 6:1 — Lamb opens seals. Slain one initiates judgment. co: SEAL.
Rev 6:16 — "wrath of the G721 Lamb." Paradox: lambs don't rage. The slain sacrifice IS the judge. co: WRATH, THRONE.
Rev 7:14 — Robes washed white in BLOOD of Lamb. Blood = purification, not staining. co: BLOOD, WHITE.
Rev 7:17 — "Lamb in MIDST of throne shall SHEPHERD G4165 them." Lamb = shepherd. co: THRONE, SHEPHERD, WATER.
Rev 12:11 — Overcome by BLOOD of Lamb + word of testimony. Blood = weapon. co: BLOOD, OVERCOMER.
Rev 13:8 — "Lamb slain from foundation G2602 of world." Pre-creation purpose. co: BOOK_OF_LIFE.
Rev 13:11 — Beast has two horns LIKE a G721 lamb, speaks as dragon. COUNTERFEIT LAMB. co: FALSE_MESSIAH, DRAGON.
Rev 14:1 — Lamb stands on Zion + 144,000 with Father's name. co: MOUNTAIN, NAME, FIRSTFRUITS.
Rev 14:4 — "Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes." Firstfruits to God AND to Lamb. co: VIRGIN, FIRSTFRUITS.
Rev 17:14 — "Lamb shall overcome them; he is Lord of lords, King of kings." co: OVERCOMER, KINGSHIP.
Rev 19:7,9 — Marriage of the Lamb. Wife made herself ready. Marriage supper. co: MARRIAGE, BRIDE, FEAST.
Rev 21:22-23 — Lord God + Lamb ARE the temple. Lamb IS the light. co: TEMPLE, LIGHT.
Rev 22:1,3 — Throne of God AND of the Lamb. River from throne. No more curse. co: THRONE, WATER, CURSE.

**PATTERN:** Lamb = substitutionary sacrifice that absorbs death → earns all authority. H7716 (generic) → H3532 (sacrificial) → G286 (identified as THE one) → G721 (enthroned). The root of H3532 (to dominate) hidden in the sacrificial animal reveals the whole arc: dominion through sacrifice, not usurpation. Rev 5:6 centers all: SLAIN yet STANDING, IN the throne, WITH all power. Every counterfeit (Rev 13:11) mimics the lamb's appearance but cannot replicate the slaying. Authority by sacrifice = the test that separates true from false.
