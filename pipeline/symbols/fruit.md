## Context Bag

**Core meaning**: FRUIT → works / deeds / actions. Visible output that reveals nature of source. As TREE known by FRUIT → people known by their works.

**Explicit parallel (strongest proof)**: Gal 5:19 uses "WORKS of the flesh" || Gal 5:22 uses "FRUIT of the Spirit" — same structure, parallel terms. WORKS = FRUIT directly established by Paul's usage.

**Proof texts**: Matt 7:16,20 — "By their fruits ye shall know them" → fruit = visible deeds that identify. John 15:5 — "bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing" → fruit || doing → fruit = works. Matt 3:8 — "Bring forth fruits meet for repentance" → fruits = works proving repentance.

**"Fruit of" pattern → "result/product of"**: Fruit of the Spirit → works of the Spirit. Fruit of the mouth → results of speech. Fruit of the womb → children (result of conception). Fruit of righteousness → works of righteousness.

**Symbol connections**: TREE → nation + FRUIT → nation's works. THORNS → worldly + choke out FRUIT/works (Mark 4:7). WIND (Spirit) + FRUIT: Gal 5:22 "fruit of the Spirit" → works produced by Spirit (invisible power).

**Summary**: FRUIT = WORKS/DEEDS. Gal 5 proves by explicit parallel. Bearing fruit = doing works of obedience. Opposite: barren/fruitless = no works.
