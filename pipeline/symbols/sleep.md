## Context Bag

**Core equation**: SLEEP → death / spiritual unawareness. State of unconsciousness to spiritual reality — unresponsive to God's TRUTH, opposite of watching.

**A. SLEEP = death (literal metaphor)**
Kings/Chronicles: "slept with his fathers" = died (dozens of occurrences). Matt 9:24 + Mark 5:39 + Luke 8:52: Jesus re maid — "not dead but sleepeth." John 11:11-13: "Lazarus sleepeth… Jesus spake of his death" — explicit authorial gloss. 1 Cor 15:6,18: "fallen asleep" / "asleep in Christ" = dead believers. 1 Thess 4:13-15: "them which are asleep" = dead in Christ. Dan 12:2: "sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake" → resurrection. Ps 13:3: "lest I sleep the sleep of death." Pattern: sleep = temporary unconsciousness || death = sleep from which one awakens (resurrection).

**B. Spiritual sleep = spiritual death/unawareness**
Rom 13:11: "high time to awake out of sleep; salvation nearer than when we believed" → spiritual unawareness subj: believers. Eph 5:14: "Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee LIGHT" — **key verse**: sleepest = dead (explicit equation) + LIGHT (visible example/awareness). 1 Thess 5:6-7: "let us not sleep as do others; but watch and be sober. They that sleep sleep in the NIGHT."

**C. Contrast structure (1 Thess 5:6-7)**
SLEEP || unaware || drunk || NIGHT vs. AWAKE/watch || vigilant || sober || DAY. Greek: καθεύδω (katheudō) = sleep vs. γρηγορέω (grēgoreō) = watch/be vigilant. To watch → alert to spiritual reality + aware of times + vigilant against deception + ready for Christ's return. SLEEP → opposite of all these → spiritual negligence.

**D. Symbol web**
SLEEP (death/unaware) + DARKNESS (hidden/concealed) + NIGHT (season of unawareness) → cluster of unconsciousness. AWAKE + LIGHT (visible example) + DAY (exposure/accountability) → cluster of awareness. Eph 5:14 ties full chain: sleep (death) → awake (arise) → receive LIGHT (become aware/example).

**E. Substitution stress test**
Rom 13:11: "awake out of spiritual unawareness" ✓. Eph 5:14: sleep = dead (explicit) ✓. 1 Thess 5:6: "let us not be unaware… but vigilant" ✓. 1 Thess 4:14: "them which are dead in Jesus" ✓. Matt 9:24: sleep used for physical death ✓.

**F. Profile of the spiritually asleep**: unaware of the times, unresponsive to God's TRUTH, not watching for Christ's return, living in spiritual DARKNESS. Call → AWAKE: become alert, arise from death, receive LIGHT.
