## Context Bag

**Prerequisite**: SEA = peoples/nations/tongues (Rev.17:15 definitional). Sea → chaotic unsanctified mass of humanity.

**Core argument — relational method**: Meaning derived NOT from physical properties of island (solid, stable) but from RELATIONSHIP to sea. Island = land SET APART FROM sea. "Set apart" = Heb. קָדוֹשׁ (qadosh) = holy/sanctified. Therefore: ISLAND → sanctified/set-apart people, distinguished from SEA (nations).

**Logic chain**: SEA = peoples/nations → ISLAND = land set apart from sea → "set apart" = sanctified/holy → ISLAND = sanctified people.

**Scriptural patterns**:

A. *Distinct peoples*: Gen.10:5 — "isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations." Isles → peoples distinguished, separated, each with own identity + territory.

B. *Isles wait for God's law/truth*: Isa.42:4 — isles wait for his law; Isa.51:5 — isles wait upon me + trust his arm; Isa.60:9 — isles wait for me. Connection: TRUTH (God's word/law) sanctifies (Jn.17:17 — "Sanctify them through thy truth"). Isles (set-apart peoples) await the very thing that sanctifies them → TRUTH/law. Isa.66:19 — send to isles afar off → distant set-apart peoples.

C. *Islands + mountains paired in judgment*: Rev.6:14 — every MOUNTAIN + ISLAND moved out of places; Rev.16:20 — every ISLAND fled, MOUNTAINS not found. MOUNTAIN = kingdom (ruling authority) || ISLAND = sanctified people (holy nation). Both = ordered structures distinguished from chaotic sea; both shaken under God's judgment.

**Recursive web**: SEA (unsanctified peoples) → ISLAND (set apart from sea = sanctified) → TRUTH (means of sanctification, Jn.17:17) → isles wait for law (Isa.42:4) = sanctified peoples await God's standard that sanctifies them.

**Substitution test** (all pass ✓): Gen.10:5 isles → set-apart peoples divided by territory; Isa.42:4 isles → sanctified peoples await his standard; Isa.51:5 isles → set-apart peoples trust in me; Isa.60:9 isles → sanctified await me; Isa.66:19 isles afar off → distant set-apart peoples; Rev.6:14 mountain + island → kingdom + sanctified people shaken; Rev.16:20 island fled → set-apart people displaced.

**Methodological principle**: When symbol exists in relationship to another symbol, the relationship (verb/action) reveals meaning. Island's meaning = relational action "set apart from" sea, not physical noun-description.
