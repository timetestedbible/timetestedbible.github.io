## Context Bag

**Core definition**: Jesus explicitly defines THORNS in Parable of Sower → Matt.13:22: "care of this world" + "deceitfulness of riches" → choke the word → unfruitful. Luke.8:14 expands: "cares + riches + pleasures of this life" → "bring no fruit to perfection."

**Parable principle (primary argument)**: Matt.13:7 — seed falls among thorns → thorns choke them. Matt.13:22 — explicit interpretation: thorns = worldly cares/riches/deceit. Mark.4:7 — thorns choked it → yielded no FRUIT. Luke.8:7 — thorns sprang up with it → choked it. Luke.8:14 — choked with cares/riches/pleasures → no FRUIT to perfection. || Luke.8:15 — opposite = "honest and good heart" → good ground → FRUIT with patience.

**TREE → Nation/People connection**: TREE = nation/people group (established symbol). Thorns/briers = type of plant/tree. Therefore thorns = a TYPE of people/nation. What type? → Parable defines: people characterized by worldly cares, riches, pleasures.

**Two dimensions**: (1) IS → a type of people/nation (worldly, materialistic); (2) DOES → chokes — actively prevents fruitfulness in others.

**Choking action across all Sower accounts**: Matt.13:7 "choked them" + Matt.13:22 "choke the word" + Mark.4:7 "choked it, yielded no fruit" + Luke.8:7 "choked it" + Luke.8:14 "choked with cares and riches and pleasures." Key verb = choke → prevent FRUIT.

**OT confirmation**: Ezek.28:24 — "no more a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them, that despised them" → thorns = peoples/nations who despise + afflict God's people (JERUSALEM). Gen.3:18 — "thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee" → part of curse; Parable of Sower reveals symbolic meaning.

**Parable substitution test**: SEED (BREAD/word) + GROUND (heart) + THORNS (worldly people) + FRUIT (works/deeds) → word falls among worldly people → their cares/riches/pleasures choke word's effectiveness → no FRUIT. All symbols cohere.

**Symbol relationships**: THORNS subtype of TREE (nation/people) + chokes BREAD (word/seed) + prevents FRUIT (works/deeds) + opposite of good ground → GRASS (people/mortal people) who bear FRUIT. Ezek.28:24 connects to JERUSALEM (covenant community) as those thorns afflict.
