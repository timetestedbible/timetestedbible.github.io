## Three-Part Structural Pattern
1. REMOVAL: Daily sacrifice/true worship taken away (Dan 8:11, 11:31, 12:11)
2. INSTALLATION: shiqquts/bdelygma placed/standing (Dan 9:27, 11:31, 12:11; Matt 24:15)
3. RESULT: shamem/eremosis - place emptied, people flee/scattered (Matt 24:16; Luke 21:21,24)

## Lexical Core
H8251 (shiqquts) from H8262 (shaqats="filthy/loathe") → idolatrous object
H8074 (shamem) → stun/devastate/empty + psychological stupefaction
G946 (bdelygma) from G948 (bdelysso="stink/detest") → idolatry
G2050 (eremosis) from G2049 (eremoo="make desolate") → despoliation

## Key Manifestations
Dan 8:13: H6588 (pesha="revolt") + H8074 → "transgression of desolation"
Dan 9:27: "wing (kanaph=pinnacle) of abominations" → temple extremity
Dan 11:31: arms pollute sanctuary, H5414 (natan="set up") abomination
Dan 12:11: daily-removed → abomination-set-up = 1,290 days
Matt 24:15: "stand in holy place" (G40+G5117)
Mark 13:14: masculine participle (hestekota) → personified WHO not WHAT
Luke 21:20: replaces phrase with "armies compass Jerusalem" → Roman power = abomination
2Thess 2:3-4: man of sin sits in naos as God → ultimate personification

## Historical Fulfillments
Antiochus 167 BC (Dan 8, 11:31): Zeus altar + pig sacrifice → 2,300 days → Hanukkah cleansing. TYPE.
Rome 70 AD (Luke 21:20): armies = counterfeit authority, desolation confirmed. PARTIAL - "until times of Gentiles fulfilled"
2Thess 2 man of sin: "mystery already works" but destroyed by RETURN OF CHRIST. UNFULFILLED.

## Recurring Pattern Intensification
Solomon's high places → Manasseh's temple idols → Antiochus Zeus → Rome destruction → ongoing mystery → final man of sin → Babylon's cup
Each cycle: true worship displaced, counterfeit installed, covenant people scattered

## Rev 11 Beast Emergence Sequence
Rev 9:1-2: abyss → SMOKE → sun darkened
Rev 9:3: agents emerge FROM SMOKE
Rev 11:7: beast FROM bottomless pit kills witnesses
Abomination = PRODUCT of Babylon's burning smoke

## Critical Connections
IDOLATRY (root=self-rule) → ABOMINATION (idolatry in holy place) → FALL_OF_BABYLON (system collapse produces beast via smoke) → RETURN_OF_CHRIST (destroys final form)
Co-occurs: DECEIVE (false Christs/prophets), WICKEDNESS (anomia), HARLOT (covenant unfaithfulness welcomes counterfeit)
Signal for RAPTURE_GATHERING (2Thess 2:1 context)

## Terminus Points
Rev 17:4-5: Babylon = mother-source of ALL counterfeit authority pattern
Rev 21:27: New Jerusalem permanently excludes the pattern
Luke 21:24: "until times of Gentiles fulfilled" → desolation has END
2Thess 2:8: final form destroyed by "brightness of his coming"
