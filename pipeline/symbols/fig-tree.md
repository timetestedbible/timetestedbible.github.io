## Context Bag

**H8384 te'enah** = "the fig (tree or fruit)," perhaps foreign derivation. ~39× OT. **G4808 syke** = "fig tree" from G4810 sykon = fig fruit. 16× NT. Fig = first fruit mentioned by species in Scripture (Gen 3:7 fig LEAVES). The fig tree is SELF-INTERPRETING: Scripture defines its symbolic range in multiple explicit passages.

**GEN 3:7 — FIRST COVERING:** Adam+Eve sew fig LEAVES → inadequate covering for nakedness/shame. Fig = human attempt at self-covering. God replaces with animal skins (blood sacrifice). Pattern: fig-leaf = insufficient human works to cover guilt.

**COVENANT PEACE FORMULA (Mic 4:4; 1Ki 4:25; 2Ki 18:31; Zech 3:10):** "Every man under his VINE and under his FIG TREE, and none shall make afraid." VINE+FIG = covenant prosperity+security. 1Ki 4:25 — Solomon's reign = the pattern fulfilled. Zech 3:10 "in THAT DAY" (eschatological). The formula IS the test for covenant faithfulness: are the people secure under their own vine+fig?

**JER 24:1-10 — GOOD FIGS / BAD FIGS = PEOPLE:** God defines explicitly: GOOD figs = exiles taken to Babylon (Jer 24:5 "acknowledge them for GOOD") → given heart to know God → restored. BAD figs = Zedekiah+remnant in land+Egypt (24:8) → sword+famine+pestilence. Figs ARE people sorted by covenant response. Good figs ACCEPT judgment (exile); bad figs resist it.

**HOS 9:10 — FIRST RIPE FIG = ISRAEL'S ORIGIN:** "I found Israel like grapes in wilderness; I saw your fathers as FIRSTRIPE in fig tree at her FIRST TIME." Israel's earliest generation = first ripe fruit = precious, sweet, eagerly desired. But: "they went to Baalpeor" = immediate corruption. First-fruit promise → immediate failure.

**MAT 24:32-33 / MK 13:28 / LK 21:29-31 — THE PARABLE:** "Learn a parable of the fig tree: when branch tender + puts forth LEAVES, ye KNOW summer is NEAR. So likewise when ye see ALL THESE THINGS, know IT IS NEAR at the doors." FUNCTION: fig tree = SEASON-INDICATOR. The fig tree does NOT represent a specific nation here — it represents recognizing the season from visible signs. "ALL the trees" (Lk 21:29) confirms: fig + ALL trees = general seasonal indicator, not coded reference to one nation.

**MAT 21:19-21 / MK 11:13-14,20-21 — CURSED FIG TREE:** Jesus seeks FRUIT, finds only LEAVES → curses → tree withers from roots. co: FAITH, MOUNTAIN cast into SEA. Mark adds: "the time of figs was NOT YET" (G2540 kairos) — Jesus expects fruit out of season from THIS tree. = Israel's temple had leaves (religious appearance) but no fruit (covenant works). Withering = covenant judgment for fruitlessness. Disciples' response → teaching on FAITH: "say to this MOUNTAIN, be removed" = temple/Jerusalem system cast into SEA (nations).

**LK 13:6-9 — PARABLE OF BARREN FIG:** Man seeks fruit 3 YEARS → none. "Cut it down, why cumbereth it the ground?" Dresser: "let it alone THIS YEAR ALSO" → dig+dung → if fruit, well; if not, THEN cut. = Three-year ministry of Jesus seeking fruit from Israel. One more year of grace. Pattern: patience before judgment, but judgment certain if fruitlessness continues.

**JER 8:13 — NO FIGS ON FIG TREE:** "No grapes on vine, no figs on fig tree, leaf shall fade." Total covenant failure. = Mat 21:19 enacted.

**ISA 34:4 / REV 6:13 — FIGS CAST BY WIND:** "Stars fall as fig from fig tree shaken by MIGHTY WIND." Isa 34:4 host of heaven fall as falling fig. Rev 6:13 stars fall as fig cast by great wind. co: SUN_MOON_STARS, WIND, EARTHQUAKE. Authorities shaken loose from their positions = unripe figs (G3653 olynthos = late/untimely fig, never ripened) blown off. Stars=authorities + figs=fruitless covenant people merged in one image.

**NAH 3:12 — STRONGHOLDS LIKE FIG TREES:** First ripe figs → if shaken → fall into mouth of eater. Nineveh's fortifications collapse at first pressure. Fortress-as-fig: impressive exterior, consumed instantly.

**SONG 2:13 — FIG TREE SIGNALS SPRING:** "Fig putteth forth green figs (H6291 paggim), vines with tender grape give smell. Arise my love, come away." Fig = TIMING SIGNAL for the bridegroom's call. co: VINE, MARRIAGE. = Mat 24:32 fig signals season.

**HAB 3:17 — FIG DOES NOT BLOSSOM:** "Though fig tree shall NOT blossom, nor fruit in vines... yet I will REJOICE in the LORD." Faith persists when covenant indicators fail. The absence of fig-fruit tests faith.

**JN 1:48-50 — NATHANAEL UNDER FIG TREE:** Jesus saw him under the fig tree BEFORE Philip called. Nathanael = "true Israelite without guile." Under the fig tree = covenant meditation/study (rabbinic tradition: studying Torah). Jesus sees the FRUIT (sincerity) before the public appearance.

**JAS 3:12 — FIG TREE CANNOT BEAR OLIVES:** Nature-law: each tree produces according to its kind. Fig yields figs, vine yields grapes. Covenant identity determines fruit type. ≠ FRUIT of mixed nature.

**PATTERN:** (1) Fig tree = covenant fruitfulness indicator. Fruit present = covenant health. Absent = judgment pending. (2) Leaves WITHOUT fruit = religious appearance without substance (Gen 3:7, Mat 21:19). (3) Fig+vine together = covenant peace fulfilled (Mic 4:4). (4) Good/bad figs = people sorted by covenant response (Jer 24). (5) Fig leafing = SEASON RECOGNIZABLE (Mat 24:32) — not the event itself, but the sign that the event is imminent. (6) Cursed fig = covenant institution judged for fruitlessness (Mat 21:19 → temple). (7) Figs shaken by wind = authorities/fruitless ones dislodged from position (Rev 6:13).
