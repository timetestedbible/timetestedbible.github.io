## Context Bag

### Three Hebrew Words for Hardening

**H2388 chazaq** — "To fasten upon; seize; be strong; obstinate; to bind, restrain." Root sense: to grip tightly, refuse to release. Used 12× for Pharaoh's heart in Exodus. When GOD is subject: Exo4:21, 9:12, 10:20, 10:27, 11:10, 14:4, 14:8, 14:17. When PHARAOH/heart is subject (passive): Exo7:13, 7:22, 8:19, 9:35. Nuance: strengthening what is already present — God firms up the direction Pharaoh has already chosen.

**H3513 kabed (verb) / H3515 kabed (adj)** — "To be heavy; in a bad sense: burdensome, severe, dull; in a good sense: numerous, honorable." Same root as "glory" (kabod). Used for Pharaoh's heart: Exo8:15, 8:32, 9:7, 9:34 (Pharaoh himself hardens); Exo9:34 (Pharaoh + servants harden); Exo10:1 (GOD hardens). Exo7:14 uses adjective H3515: "Pharaoh's heart IS heavy." Also 1Sa6:6 — Philistines warned not to harden hearts "as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts." Nuance: making heavy/weighty — heart becomes dull, unresponsive, laden.

**H7185 qashah** — "To be dense, tough, severe; to be cruel, hard, stiff." Used once for Pharaoh: Exo7:3 "I will harden (H7185) Pharaoh's heart." Also Exo13:15 "Pharaoh would hardly (H7185) let us go." Applied to Israel: Deu10:16 "be no more stiffnecked (H6203 + H7185)"; 2Ch30:8 same; Jer7:26, 17:23, 19:15 "hardened their neck (H7185)." Psa95:8 "Harden (H7185) not your heart." Pro28:14 "he that hardeneth (H7185) his heart shall fall into mischief." Pro29:1 "hardeneth (H7185) his neck shall suddenly be destroyed." Eze3:7 uses related adj H7186: Israel "hardhearted." Nuance: dense, impenetrable — hardened like stone (cf. petrified).

### Exodus Hardening Sequence (20 references across Exo4-14)

**Phase 1 — Announced** (Exo4:21): God tells Moses in advance: "I will harden (H2388) his heart." Exo7:3: "I will harden (H7185) Pharaoh's heart." Both announced BEFORE the plagues begin.

**Phase 2 — Pharaoh hardens himself** (plagues 1-5): Exo7:13 heart "was strong" (H2388, ambiguous subject). Exo7:14 heart "IS heavy" (H3515, state description). Exo7:22 heart "was strong" (H2388). Exo8:15 Pharaoh "made heavy" (H3513) his own heart. Exo8:19 heart "was strong" (H2388). Exo8:32 Pharaoh "made heavy" (H3513) his heart. Exo9:7 heart "was heavy" (H3513).

**Phase 3 — God hardens** (plagues 6-10+): Exo9:12 LORD "strengthened" (H2388) Pharaoh's heart — first explicit divine hardening in the plague sequence. Exo9:34 Pharaoh "made heavy" (H3513) his heart (brief reversion). Exo9:35 heart "was strong" (H2388). Exo10:1 "I have made heavy" (H3513) his heart — God claims the H3513 action. Exo10:20 LORD "strengthened" (H2388). Exo10:27 LORD "strengthened" (H2388). Exo11:10 LORD "strengthened" (H2388).

**Phase 4 — Pursuit to destruction** (Exo14): Exo14:4 "I will harden" (H2388). Exo14:8 LORD "strengthened" (H2388). Exo14:17 "I will harden" (H2388) the hearts of the Egyptians (now extended to entire nation). Result: Red Sea drowning.

**Dual agency pattern**: Pharaoh acts first (H3513, making heavy — his own will), God confirms (H2388, strengthening — sealing the trajectory). The three words never randomly interchange: H3513 (heavy) clusters with Pharaoh's own action, H2388 (strong/grip) clusters with God's action, H7185 (dense) appears in the initial decree. 1Sa6:6 looks back at the pattern as a warning: "Wherefore then do ye harden (H3513) your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened (H3513) their hearts?"

### Greek: Two Words for Hardening

**G4645 skleruno** — "To indurate, render stubborn." From G4642 skleros = hard. 6 NT occurrences. Act19:9 — some "were hardened and believed not." Rom9:18 — "whom he will he hardeneth" (Paul's interpretation of Exodus pattern). Heb3:8, 3:15, 4:7 — quoting Psa95:8 "harden not your hearts." Heb3:13 — "lest any be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."

**G4456 poroo** — "To petrify; figuratively to indurate, render stupid or callous." Derived from poros = "a kind of stone." Related noun G4457 porosis = "stupidity or callousness" (translated "blindness" and "hardness"). 5 occurrences. Mar6:52 — disciples' heart "was hardened (petrified)" after loaves miracle. Mar8:17 — "have ye your heart yet hardened (petrified)?" — disciples STILL petrified. Joh12:40 — "He hath blinded their eyes and hardened (petrified) their heart" (quoting Isa6:10). Rom11:7 — "the rest were blinded (petrified)." 2Co3:14 — "their minds were blinded (petrified)" — veil on reading of old covenant.

Noun G4457 porosis: Mar3:5 — Jesus grieved at "hardness (petrification) of their hearts." Rom11:25 — "blindness (petrification) in part is happened to Israel." Eph4:18 — "alienated from the life of God… because of the blindness (petrification) of their heart."

### Pattern Beyond Exodus

**Prophetic warning** (Psa95:8): "Harden not your heart as in the provocation" — Meribah/Massah. Links hardened heart to wilderness generation who saw God's works 40 years but never entered rest.

**Wisdom principle** (Pro28:14, 29:1): "He that hardeneth his heart SHALL FALL." "He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall SUDDENLY be destroyed, and that without remedy." Hardening → sudden destruction. No gradual decline — abrupt end.

**Jeremiah's diagnosis** (Jer7:26, 17:23, 19:15): Israel "hardened their neck" — stiff-necked = same as hard-hearted. Pattern exactly mirrors Pharaoh: saw signs → refused to respond → destruction came.

**Disciples petrified** (Mar6:52, 8:17): Even the Twelve can have "petrified" hearts — not just enemies. They saw miracles (loaves) but did not perceive the meaning. G4456 (petrify) = heart turned to stone. Opposite of Eze36:26 "take away the stony heart… give you a heart of flesh."

**Israel's corporate petrification** (Rom11:7, 25): "Blindness (G4457 porosis = petrification) in part is happened to Israel." Same word as Mar3:5 and Eph4:18. National hardening mirrors Pharaoh's individual hardening.

**Revelation endgame** (Rev16:9, 11): After bowls of wrath — "they repented not (G3340 metanoeo)." No hardening verb used, but the PATTERN is identical: see God's judgments → refuse to repent → more judgment. The Pharaoh cycle replayed at cosmic scale.

### Pattern Summary

HARDENED HEART = progressive resistance to revelation that becomes irreversible. The mechanism: (1) God reveals truth → (2) human refuses → (3) heart becomes heavier/harder → (4) God confirms the trajectory → (5) capacity to respond dies → (6) judgment comes suddenly. Three Hebrew words map three phases: H3513 kabed (self-imposed heaviness), H2388 chazaq (God-confirmed grip), H7185 qashah (resulting density/impermeability). Two Greek words: G4645 skleruno (stubborn refusal) and G4456 poroo (petrification — turned to stone). The Pharaoh narrative is THE defining case. Every subsequent reference (1Sa6:6, Psa95:8, Heb3-4, Rom9) points BACK to Exodus. Pharaoh's pattern becomes Israel's pattern (Jer7, Eze3, Rom11), becomes the disciples' danger (Mar6,8), becomes the universal human pattern (Heb3:13 "deceitfulness of sin"), becomes the end-times pattern (Rev16).

The dual-agency question: God does not create resistance ex nihilo — He strengthens (H2388) what the person has already chosen (H3513). Pharaoh made his heart heavy; God made it firm. This is Paul's point in Rom9:17-18: God raised Pharaoh up to display power, and "whom he will he hardeneth" — but Pharaoh's own heaviness came first.
