## Context Bag

**LEXICAL:** G5580 pseudochristos = pseudo + christos (anointed). Only 2×: Matt 24:24, Mark 13:22. G5578 pseudoprophetes = pseudo + prophetes. 11×. G500 antichristos = anti + christos (opponent/substitute of Messiah). 5× in 1-2John only. Three words, three angles: counterfeit anointed (G5580), counterfeit spokesman (G5578), opponent of anointed (G500). All share G5571 pseudés = false/lying.

**THREE-LAYER STRUCTURE:**
Layer 1 — SPIRIT: 1John 4:3 "spirit of antichrist" already in world. 1John 2:18 "many antichrists" = principle operating through many agents. Test: confess Jesus came in flesh? (1John 4:1-3). Denial of incarnation = operating principle.
Layer 2 — SYSTEM: 2Pet 2:1 false prophets among people → false teachers, privily bring damnable heresies, deny the Lord that bought them. Acts 13:6 Bar-Jesus = Jewish sorcerer + false prophet opposing truth. Luke 6:26 "so did their fathers to false prophets" = recurring institutional pattern.
Layer 3 — PERSON: Rev 13:11 beast from earth, two horns like G721 arnion (LAMB counterfeit), speaks as G1404 dragon. Rev 19:20 false prophet works miracles before beast = G4105 deceives mark-bearers. Rev 16:13 unholy trinity: dragon + beast + false prophet. 2Thess 2:3-4 man of sin sits in temple as God.

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**
Matt 24:5 — "many shall come in my name saying I am Christ" + G4105 deceive many. co: DECEIVE. First warning in Olivet Discourse = false messiahs PRECEDE all other signs.
Matt 24:11 — "many false prophets G5578 shall rise" + G4105 deceive many. co: WICKEDNESS (v12 anomia).
Matt 24:24 — false Christs G5580 + false prophets G5578 show great G4592 signs + G5059 wonders → if possible deceive elect. co: SIGNS, DECEIVE. Signs ≠ validation; counterfeit produces genuine-looking signs.
Matt 7:15 — false prophets come in sheep's G4263 clothing, inwardly ravening G727 wolves G3074. co: SHEEP, ANIMAL. External appearance mimics flock membership.
Mark 13:22 — parallel Matt 24:24. G635 apoplanao = lead astray from path.
1John 2:18 — antichrist (singular) coming + many antichrists (plural) already present. "Last time" marker.
1John 2:22 — antichrist = denies Father AND Son. Not merely anti-Jesus but anti-covenant-relationship.
2John 1:7 — many deceivers G4108 + THE deceiver + THE antichrist. Definite articles = culminating figure.
Rev 13:11 — LAMB-MIMICRY: two horns like arnion but dragon-speech. Counterfeit operates through LAMB imagery. co: LAMB, DRAGON, ANIMAL.
Rev 19:20 — beast + false prophet → lake of fire. G4105 deceived mark-bearers with G4592 signs. co: FIRE, MARK.
Rev 20:10 — dragon + beast + false prophet: final judgment of unholy trinity. Tormented forever.

**COUNTERFEIT PATTERN:** False messiah always mimics genuine: signs (Matt 24:24), lamb appearance (Rev 13:11), temple seat (2Thess 2:4), prophetic office (Matt 7:15). Distinguishing mark: SOURCE of authority (self-exaltation vs. God-given) and FRUIT (draws TO self vs. TO God). "By their fruits" Matt 7:16-20 = the test.

**ESCALATION:** Spirit already present (1John 4:3) → many antichrists active (1John 2:18) → false prophets among congregations (2Pet 2:1) → great signs and wonders (Matt 24:24) → final false prophet empowered by dragon (Rev 13:11-15) → destroyed at parousia (Rev 19:20, 2Thess 2:8).

**PATTERN:** False messiah ≠ external enemy; false messiah = covenant-space infiltrator wearing covenant appearance. Most dangerous because indistinguishable by signs alone — requires testing against confession (1John 4:1-3) and fruit (Matt 7:16). Convergence with MAN_OF_SIN: both usurp covenant authority from within. Convergence with LAMB: Rev 13:11 counterfeit specifically mimics the Lamb's form.
