## Etymology — The Root IS the Meaning

**H7999 שָׁלַם (shalam)** = primitive root. "To be safe (in mind, body, estate); figuratively to be/make COMPLETED; by implication to be friendly; by extension to RECIPROCATE." KJV: "make amends, end, finish, full, give again, make good, repay, peace, perfect, perform, prosper, recompense, render, requite, make RESTITUTION, RESTORE, reward."

Root = COMPLETENESS + RECIPROCITY. Not absence of conflict but presence of fulfilled obligation.

**H7965 שָׁלוֹם (shalom)** = from H7999. "Safe, well, happy, friendly; welfare, health, prosperity, PEACE." The STATE produced by shalam = everything complete, everything restored, everything reciprocated.

**H8002 שֶׁלֶם (shelem)** = from H7999. "Properly, REQUITAL, i.e. a voluntary sacrifice in thanks." KJV: peace offering. The offering that COMPLETES the relationship — not guilt/sin offering (debt-paying) but thanksgiving (debt-already-paid celebration).

**H8003 שָׁלֵם (shalem)** = from H7999. "Complete, whole, perfect, peaceable." Adjective form.

**H8004 שָׁלֵם (Shalem)** = same as H8003. "Peaceful." KJV: Salem. Early name of JERUSALEM. The city IS named for peace/wholeness. Gen 14:18 Melchizedek king of Salem = king of completeness. Heb 7:2 interprets: "King of Salem = King of peace." Jerusalem = city of covenant-wholeness.

**G1515 εἰρήνη (eirēnē)** = "probably from a primary verb (to join)." "Peace, prosperity, quietness, rest, set at one again." Greek emphasizes JOINING — reconnection of separated parties.

**G1517 εἰρηνοποιέω (eirēnopoieō)** = to make peace/harmonize. Col 1:20 "having MADE PEACE through the blood of his cross."

**WORD-FAMILY CHAIN:** H7999 shalam (verb: complete/restore) → H7965 shalom (noun: wholeness-state) → H8002 shelem (offering: completion-sacrifice) → H8003 shalem (adj: complete) → H8004 Shalem/Salem (place: city of wholeness = Jerusalem). Root pervades: the VERB produces the STATE which generates the OFFERING in the CITY.

## Candidate Meanings

1. **Absence of conflict/war** — Dictionary meaning. "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem" = pray no war? Ps 37:11 "abundance of peace" ≠ "abundance of no-war." Isa 53:5 "chastisement of our peace" = chastisement of our no-conflict? Incoherent. ✗ too thin.

2. **Safety/security** — 1Th 5:3 pairs "peace AND safety" (G1515 + G803 asphaleia) as DISTINCT terms. If synonymous, pairing is redundant. ✗ distinct concept.

3. **Inner tranquility/serenity** — Jn 14:27, Phil 4:7 work. But Ezek 34:25 "covenant of peace" is structural/communal. Isa 9:7 "increase of peace" is governmental. Ps 122:6 "peace of Jerusalem" is communal. Too individualistic. ✗ part only.

4. **Wholeness/completeness (etymological)** — H7999 = to be complete/make whole/restore. H7965 = state of being complete. Captures root meaning. But "wholeness" without framework is vague — whole with respect to what? ✓ etymologically correct but needs context.

5. **Covenant-wholeness — condition of completed covenant, nothing lacking, nothing broken, nothing owed** — Takes #4 and adds covenant framework. Covenant = agreement with obligations. Shalom = state where all obligations met → parties "whole" toward each other. This explains:
   - Isa 53:5: "chastisement of our [covenant-wholeness] was upon him" — bore penalty so covenant complete
   - Isa 48:22/57:21: "no [covenant-wholeness] to the wicked" — violators cannot have completeness
   - Jer 6:14: "[whole], [whole]; when there is no [wholeness]" — prophets lie about covenant status
   - 1Th 5:3: claiming covenant-wholeness when judgment imminent = fatal delusion
   - Matt 10:34: "not come to send [covenant-wholeness] but sword" — disrupts false wholeness
   ✓ works across ALL categories.

6. **Restoration/restitution (from shalam = repay)** — Emphasizes repair dimension. Works for Isa 53:5, Col 1:20 but too narrow for Num 6:26 (blessing) or Ps 37:11 (abundance). ✗ part only.

7. **Right-relationship producing flourishing** — Isa 32:17 "work of righteousness shall be peace." But "flourishing" is too broad, overlaps with prosperity. ✗ vague.

8. **The completed state of covenant — nothing lacking, nothing broken, nothing owed — given by God, counterfeited by false prophets, achieved through Messiah's suffering** — Refines #5 with three-dimensional framework: (a) given from above (Num 6:26, Jn 14:27), (b) counterfeited from below (Jer 6:14, 1Th 5:3), (c) purchased at cost (Isa 53:5, Col 1:20). ✓ comprehensive.

**SELECTED: #5/#8 combined.** Peace/shalom = covenant-wholeness — the condition of completed covenant between God and His people. Nothing lacking, nothing broken, nothing owed. The root H7999 shalam = to complete/restore/make whole. True peace is GIVEN by God (Num 6:26), EMBODIED in Messiah (Isa 9:6, Eph 2:14), PURCHASED by suffering (Isa 53:5), and produces FRUIT (Isa 32:17). False peace is the prophetic lie that claims wholeness while covenant is broken (Jer 6:14, 1Th 5:3).

## Substitution Tests

1. **Num 6:26** — "The LORD give thee [covenant-wholeness]." Priestly blessing = God bestows covenant-completion. ✓
2. **Isa 9:6-7** — "Prince of [covenant-wholeness]... increase of [covenant-wholeness] no end, upon throne of David." Ruler who makes/keeps covenant complete forever. ✓
3. **Isa 48:22/57:21** — "No [covenant-wholeness] to the wicked." Covenant violators cannot have completeness. Structural refrain dividing Isaiah. ✓
4. **Isa 53:5** — "Chastisement of our [covenant-wholeness] was upon him." He bore the covenant-breaking penalty so we could be whole. ✓
5. **Jer 6:14/8:11** — "[Covenant-whole], [covenant-whole]; when there is no [covenant-wholeness]." Prophets lie about covenant status. Verbatim repeat = emphasis. ✓
6. **1Th 5:3** — "When they say [covenant-wholeness] and safety, then sudden destruction." Claiming restoration when judgment is imminent. ✓
7. **John 14:27** — "My [covenant-wholeness] I give you, not as world gives." True vs counterfeit completeness. World's version = sham. ✓
8. **Ps 122:6** — "Pray for the [covenant-wholeness] of Jerusalem." Pray the covenant community remains whole. ✓
9. **Eph 2:14** — "He IS our [covenant-wholeness], who made both one." Christ = the covenant completion itself. ✓
10. **Matt 10:34** — "Think not I came to send [covenant-wholeness]... but a sword." His coming DISRUPTS false wholeness to establish true. The sword separates what was falsely joined. ✓

All 10 diverse tests pass. False-peace passages are especially powerful: they expose the gap between CLAIMED covenant-wholeness and ACTUAL covenant violation.

## Context Bag

### A. THE ROOT FAMILY — NAMES ENCODE MEANING

**Gen 14:18** — subj: Melchizedek. "King of Salem [H8004]." co: BREAD, WINE, JERUSALEM, NAME. DETAIL: Salem = first name for Jerusalem's site. King of Shalem = king of wholeness/peace. Brings bread+wine = covenant elements. Priest of Most High. Heb 7:2 interprets: "first King of Righteousness, then King of Peace." ORDER: righteousness THEN peace. Peace follows righteousness.

**Judg 6:24** — subj: Gideon's altar. "Jehovah-shalom [H3073] = the LORD is peace." co: NAME, FEAR. DETAIL: Built AFTER "peace be unto thee; fear not, thou shalt not die" (v23). God's NAME = His character = covenant-wholeness-giver. Altar name = testimony.

**Ps 122:6-8** — subj: Pray for Jerusalem. "Pray for the shalom of Yerushalaim [Jerusalem]." co: JERUSALEM, NAME. DETAIL: wordplay — sha'al shalom Yerushalaim. Peace/Salem/Jerusalem share the root. Praying for the city IS praying for covenant-wholeness for the covenant community. "Peace be within thy walls" (v7). "For my brethren and companions" (v8).

### B. TRUE PEACE — GOD-GIVEN COVENANT WHOLENESS

**Num 6:26** — subj: priestly blessing. "The LORD give thee shalom." co: NAME (v27 "put my name upon them"), LIGHT (v25 "make his face shine"). DETAIL: God GIVES peace — it's not earned or manufactured. Final word of the blessing = culmination. Face-shining → favor → peace. Chain: God's face → light → grace → wholeness.

**Num 25:12** — subj: Phinehas. "I give unto him my covenant of peace." co: COVENANT, ZEAL. DETAIL: covenant-of-shalom given for zealous action against idolatry. Peace ≠ passivity.

**Isa 9:6-7** — subj: Messianic child. "Prince of Shalom [H8269+H7965]... of the increase of his government and shalom there shall be no qets [H7093 end]." co: NAME (Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father), THRONE, DAVID, RIGHTEOUSNESS, JUDGMENT. DETAIL: H7093 qets = same "end" word as Mat 24:14 / Dan 12:4,9,13. The increase of covenant-wholeness NEVER ENDS. Government + shalom paired = structural, not sentimental.

**Isa 26:3** — subj: perfect peace. "Shalom shalom [doubled] whose mind is stayed on thee." co: TRUST, FAITH. DETAIL: "Perfect peace" = shalom shalom (intensive doubling). Cause: mind stayed [H5564 samak = leaned, supported] on God. CONTRAST: Jer 6:14 shalom shalom as FALSE claim vs Isa 26:3 shalom shalom as REAL condition. Same words, opposite truth-value.

**Isa 32:17** — subj: righteousness produces peace. "The work of righteousness shall be shalom; the effect of righteousness quietness [H8252 sha'an = ease] and assurance [H983 betach = security] forever." co: RIGHTEOUSNESS. DETAIL: righteousness → shalom → quietness → assurance. PRODUCTION CHAIN. Note: H8252 sha'an = same word as Sodom's "idleness" (Ezek 16:49). Same ease WITHOUT righteousness = Sodom's sin. WITH righteousness = covenant peace. Word doesn't change — the CAUSE determines the character.

**Isa 52:7** — subj: gospel. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that publisheth shalom... that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!" co: MOUNTAIN, JERUSALEM/ZION, NAME, GOSPEL_OF_KINGDOM. DETAIL: publishing shalom = announcing God's reign = gospel. Peace is the MESSAGE content. Rom 10:15, Eph 6:15 "gospel of peace" draw from this.

**Isa 53:5** — subj: Suffering Servant. "The chastisement [H4148 musar = discipline/correction] of our shalom was upon him; with his stripes we are healed [H7495 rapha]." co: SIN, HEALING, COVENANT. DETAIL: our covenant-wholeness COST him chastisement. H4148 musar = same word as Prov wisdom-discipline. The corrective payment required for our completeness fell on him. "Healed" = covenant relationship restored.

**Isa 54:10** — subj: covenant of peace. "My covenant of shalom shall not be removed." co: MOUNTAIN (shall depart), MARRIAGE. DETAIL: mountains may shake (EARTHQUAKE) but shalom-covenant stands. More stable than creation.

**Isa 55:12** — subj: exodus-peace. "Go out with joy, led forth with shalom; mountains and hills break forth singing, trees clap hands." co: MOUNTAIN, TREE. DETAIL: creation participates in covenant-wholeness. Not just human peace — cosmic restoration.

**Ps 37:11** — subj: meek inherit earth. "The meek shall inherit the earth and delight themselves in the abundance of shalom." co: EARTH, MEEK. DETAIL: Mat 5:5 quotes this. "Abundance of shalom" = not just presence but SURPLUS of wholeness. Inheritance language = covenant promise.

**Ps 85:10** — subj: four attributes meet. "Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and shalom have kissed." co: TRUTH, RIGHTEOUSNESS, MERCY. DETAIL: four covenant-attributes converge as persons meeting/kissing. Righteousness + peace TOGETHER — cannot have peace without righteousness. Same principle as Heb 7:2 order.

**Ps 119:165** — subj: law-lovers' peace. "Great shalom to them that love thy law [H8451 torah]; nothing shall offend [H4383 mikshol = stumbling block] them." co: LAW/TORAH, SKANDALIZO. DETAIL: Torah-love → great shalom → no stumbling. Anti-SKANDALIZO effect. Covenant faithfulness = stability.

**Ezek 34:25** — subj: covenant of peace. "I will make with them a covenant of shalom, and will cause evil beasts to cease." co: COVENANT, ANIMAL (evil beasts), SHEPHERD (context), SLEEP (safely). DETAIL: H3772 karath (cut) + H1285 berith (covenant) + H7965 shalom. God CUTS a peace-covenant. Evil beasts removed = anti-covenant forces neutralized. Sleep safely = OPPOSITE of alarmed-fear.

**Ezek 37:26** — subj: everlasting covenant of peace. "I will make a covenant of shalom with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant." co: COVENANT, SANCTUARY. DETAIL: set sanctuary in midst = God dwelling among people = wholeness fulfilled.

**Mic 5:5** — subj: Messiah as peace. "And THIS MAN shall be the shalom." co: SHEPHERD (born in Bethlehem, v2), ASSYRIA (invader). DETAIL: not "this man shall BRING peace" but "shall BE the peace." Person = embodiment of covenant-wholeness. Parallels Eph 2:14 "HE IS our peace."

**Hag 2:9** — subj: latter house glory. "In THIS PLACE will I give shalom." co: MOUNTAIN (house/temple), GLORY. DETAIL: greater glory → peace given. Place-specific: where God's presence dwells = where wholeness is given.

**Zech 14:11** — subj: no more cherem. "There shall be no more utter destruction [H2764 cherem]; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited." co: JERUSALEM, CHEREM. DETAIL: no more cherem = resolution of Mal 4:6 threat. Safe habitation = shalom actualized. The LAST STATE of Jerusalem = what peace looks like: no more ban, no more destruction, permanent safe dwelling.

**Mal 2:5-6** — subj: covenant with Levi. "My covenant was with him of life and shalom... the law of truth was in his mouth." co: COVENANT, TRUTH, LAW. DETAIL: life + peace given together. Truth in mouth = covenant-faithfulness. Walk with God in peace and equity.

### C. PEACE IN CHRIST — NT FULFILLMENT

**Luke 2:14** — subj: angelic announcement. "On earth peace [G1515], good will toward men." co: GLORY. DETAIL: at incarnation → covenant-wholeness announced for earth.

**Luke 19:42** — subj: Jesus weeps over Jerusalem. "If thou hadst known... the things which belong unto thy peace! But now they are HID from thine eyes." co: JERUSALEM, JUDGMENT. DETAIL: Jerusalem's own shalom hidden → destruction follows (v43-44). The city-of-peace (Salem) has lost its own peace. Failure to know covenant-terms = loss of covenant-wholeness.

**John 14:27** — subj: Upper Room. "Shalom I leave with you, MY shalom I give unto you: NOT AS THE WORLD GIVETH." co: ALARMED_FEAR ("let not heart be troubled, neither afraid"). DETAIL: world gives counterfeit completeness (false security, Jer 6:14-type). Christ gives actual wholeness. Two kinds of "peace" — one real, one sham.

**John 16:33** — subj: parting words. "In me ye have peace. In the world tribulation [G2347 thlipsis = pressure]. But be of good cheer — I have overcome the world." co: TRIBULATION. DETAIL: peace IN Christ coexists with pressure FROM world. Not absence of conflict but presence of wholeness WITHIN conflict.

**Rom 5:1** — subj: justification. "Being justified by faith, we have peace [G1515] with [G4314 pros = toward] God through our Lord Jesus Christ." co: FAITH, RIGHTEOUSNESS (justification). DETAIL: G4314 pros = directional — peace TOWARD God. Relational restoration. Justification → peace (same order as Heb 7:2: righteousness then peace).

**Rom 8:6** — subj: spiritual mind. "To be spiritually minded is life and peace [G1515]." co: LIFE, SPIRIT. DETAIL: carnal mind = death. Spiritual mind = life + peace. Mindset determines covenant-status experienced.

**Eph 2:14-17** — subj: Christ IS peace. "He IS our peace [G1515], who hath made both one, broken down the middle wall of partition... making peace [G1517 eirēnopoieō]... and came and preached peace to you far off, and to them near." co: COVENANT, ONE-BODY. DETAIL: G1515 peace = Christ Himself (cf. Mic 5:5). Wall broken = barrier between Jew/Gentile removed. Covenant-wholeness includes BOTH parties in one body. Making peace (G1517) = active covenant-restoration.

**Phil 4:7** — subj: peace guards hearts. "The peace [G1515] of God, which passeth all understanding, shall KEEP [G5432 phroureo = garrison/guard] your hearts and minds." co: PRAYER. DETAIL: peace as military GUARD. G5432 = military term for garrisoning a city. Covenant-wholeness doesn't just comfort — it FORTIFIES. Opposite of alarmed-fear.

**Col 1:20** — subj: reconciliation. "Having MADE PEACE [G1517 eirēnopoieō] through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things." co: BLOOD, CROSS. DETAIL: peace-making required BLOOD. H7999 shalam = make restitution/pay back. The cross = the payment that completes the covenant. Peace is not cheap; it costs everything.

**Heb 7:2** — subj: Melchizedek typology. "King of Salem = King of peace [G1515]." co: RIGHTEOUSNESS, JERUSALEM. DETAIL: FIRST king of righteousness, THEN king of peace. Order = principle: righteousness PRECEDES peace. Cannot have shalom without tsedek.

### D. FALSE PEACE — THE PROPHETIC LIE

**Jer 6:14/8:11** — subj: false healing. "They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people SLIGHTLY [H7043 qalal = lightly/superficially], saying, Shalom, shalom; when there is no shalom." co: DECEIVE, JERUSALEM, HEALING. DETAIL: H7043 = make light of, treat as trivial. The WOUND (H7667 sheber = fracture/breaking) is real but the DIAGNOSIS is false. Three uses of H7965 in one verse: claimed twice (shalom shalom), denied once (no shalom). Repeated verbatim Jer 6:14 and 8:11 = emphasis. The lie: "covenant is intact" when covenant is shattered.

**Jer 14:13** — subj: false prophets promise peace. "The prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see sword nor famine; I will give you assured shalom in this place." co: SWORD, FAMINE, DECEIVE. DETAIL: "assured peace" [H571 emeth + H7965 shalom = TRUE peace] — they claim certainty. God responds (v14): "The prophets prophesy LIES in my name."

**Jer 23:17** — subj: Jerusalem's prophets. "They say unto every one that despiseth me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have shalom." co: SODOM (v14 context), DECEIVE. DETAIL: promising covenant-wholeness to covenant-DESPISERS. The ultimate false-peace: shalom for the H5006-contemptuous.

**Jer 28:9** — subj: test of true prophet. "The prophet which prophesieth of SHALOM — when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then shall the prophet be known." co: TRUTH, PROPHET. DETAIL: peace-prophecy requires FULFILLMENT as verification. Because peace is the desirable outcome, it's the easiest to falsely promise. Higher burden of proof.

**Ezek 13:10,16** — subj: false prophets and wall. "They have seduced [H2937 ta'ah] my people, saying SHALOM when there was no SHALOM; and one built up a wall, and lo, others daubed it with UNTEMPERED MORTAR [H8602 taphel]." co: DECEIVE, JERUSALEM, WALL. DETAIL: false peace = untempered mortar on cracked wall. Covers structural failure with cosmetic fix. v16: "prophets of Israel which see visions of SHALOM for her, and there is no SHALOM." Three passages use identical formula: Jer 6:14, Jer 8:11, Ezek 13:10/16.

**Mic 3:5** — subj: prophets cry peace. "Prophets that make my people err [H8582 ta'ah = DECEIVE], that bite with teeth and cry SHALOM; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare WAR against him." co: DECEIVE, WARS_AND_RUMORS, BREAD (mouths/feeding). DETAIL: peace-cry is transactional — they prophesy shalom to those who FEED them, declare war on those who don't. Peace for sale = Babylonian system.

**1Th 5:3** — subj: false peace before sudden destruction. "When they shall say, Peace [G1515] and safety [G803 asphaleia]; then sudden destruction [G160+G3639]." co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, BIRTH_PAINS (as travail), SLEEP/DARKNESS (v4-7), SODOM-pattern. DETAIL: G803 asphaleia = security/certainty (from alpha-privative + sphallo = cause to fall → "unfallable"). Claiming BOTH covenant-wholeness AND structural security → destruction. The CLAIM triggers the contrast. Paul draws from Jer 6:14 shalom-shalom + Isa 47:11 Babylon's sudden-destruction. Full OT chain: Jer 6:14 → Jer 8:11 → Ezek 13:10 → Mic 3:5 → 1Th 5:3.

### E. NO PEACE TO THE WICKED — STRUCTURAL DIVIDERS

**Isa 48:22** — "There is no shalom, saith the LORD, unto the wicked [H7563 rasha]." co: WICKED. DETAIL: structural divider at end of Isa 48. Repeated Isa 57:21. These two verses divide Isaiah's latter section into three parts (chs 40-48, 49-57, 58-66). The refrain = covenant axiom: wickedness and wholeness are mutually exclusive.

**Isa 57:19-21** — "Shalom, shalom to him that is far off and to him that is near... I will HEAL him. But the wicked are like the troubled sea... no shalom to the wicked." co: HEALING, SEA. DETAIL: peace TO those far and near (Eph 2:17 quotes this). But wicked = like SEA (restless, never still). Two destinies from same word.

**Isa 59:8** — "The WAY of shalom they know not." co: WAY, FEET. DETAIL: they don't know the path to wholeness. Their feet "make haste to shed blood" (v7) = opposite of Isa 52:7 "beautiful feet that publish peace." Two kinds of feet on two kinds of paths.

### F. PARADOXICAL PEACE — SWORD BEFORE SHALOM

**Matt 10:34** — subj: Jesus brings division. "Think not that I am come to send peace [G1515] on earth: I came not to send peace, but a SWORD [G3162]." co: SWORD, FAMILY. DETAIL: not negating shalom but negating FALSE shalom. The sword DIVIDES what was falsely joined. Same principle as Jer 6:14: claiming peace when there is none. Jesus comes to END the false peace so true peace can be established. Disruption precedes restoration.

**Luke 12:51** — parallel to Matt 10:34. "Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather DIVISION [G1267 diamerismos]." co: FAMILY, DIVISION. DETAIL: G1267 = thorough partitioning. Before true wholeness, false unity must be exposed and separated.

**Rev 6:4** — subj: red horse. "Power given to him to take peace [G1515] from the earth." co: SWORD, WARS_AND_RUMORS, FOUR_HORSEMEN. DETAIL: peace REMOVED as judgment-mechanism. The rider doesn't bring war — he takes AWAY peace. War is what's LEFT when covenant-wholeness is removed.

## Pattern Summary

**SHALOM'S THREE DIMENSIONS:**
1. **GIVEN from above** — Num 6:26, Jn 14:27, Eph 2:14. God/Christ GIVES peace. Cannot be manufactured.
2. **COUNTERFEITED from below** — Jer 6:14, Ezek 13:10, 1Th 5:3. False prophets/systems CLAIM peace. Always exposed.
3. **PURCHASED at cost** — Isa 53:5, Col 1:20, Heb 13:20. Covenant-wholeness requires blood payment.

**PEACE || RIGHTEOUSNESS ORDER:**
Heb 7:2: FIRST king of righteousness, THEN king of peace. Isa 32:17: work of righteousness SHALL BE peace. Ps 85:10: righteousness and peace KISS. Peace follows righteousness as effect follows cause. Peace WITHOUT righteousness = Jer 6:14 false peace. Righteousness WITHOUT peace = incomplete covenant.

**THE FALSE-PEACE CHAIN (OT→NT):**
Jer 6:14/8:11 → Ezek 13:10,16 → Mic 3:5 → Jer 23:17 → **1Th 5:3**
Each adds dimension: Jeremiah = false healing. Ezekiel = cosmetic wall. Micah = peace-for-hire. Paul = eschatological climax. Pattern: false wholeness → sudden exposure → destruction.

**OPPOSITES — PEACE || ALARMED_FEAR:**
Same events produce opposite responses. Covenant-keepers: Jn 14:27 "let not heart be troubled" + "my peace I give." Covenant-breakers: 1Th 5:3 "sudden destruction" + Lk 21:26 "hearts failing for fear." Peace is the DIAGNOSTIC: those who have it are in covenant; those who lack it are exposed.

**SODOM CONNECTION:**
Sodom = Ezek 16:49 "abundance of idleness [H8252]." Isa 32:17 "effect of righteousness = H8252 quietness." SAME WORD (sha'an = ease/quiet). With righteousness → peace. Without righteousness → Sodom. The word doesn't change; the COVENANT STATUS does.

**ROADMAP CONNECTIONS:**
- SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION: 1Th 5:3 "peace and safety → sudden destruction." False peace = immediate precursor.
- WARS_AND_RUMORS: opposite of shalom. Both studies list the other as opposite. War = shalom removed (Rev 6:4).
- ALARMED_FEAR: peace is the antidote (Jn 14:27). Fear is the diagnostic for those without peace.
- FALL_OF_BABYLON: Babylon claims "I sit as queen... shall see no sorrow" (Rev 18:7) = false peace at civilizational scale. 1Th 5:3 = Babylon's final peace-cry before fire.
- RETURN_OF_CHRIST: Isa 9:6-7 "increase of peace no end" = Christ's kingdom = permanent covenant-wholeness. The END of the false-peace/sudden-destruction cycle.
- SODOM: prosperity + ease WITHOUT covenant = Sodom. Prosperity + ease WITH covenant = shalom. Same material conditions, opposite spiritual states.

**ZECH 14:11 — THE RESOLUTION:**
"No more cherem; Jerusalem safely inhabited." CHEREM = total destruction ban (Mal 4:6 last word of OT threatens earth with cherem). Zech 14:11 = cherem ENDED. H983 betach = safely = security. This is the OPPOSITE of 1Th 5:3 false safety. When God establishes true peace, security follows genuinely. No more ban, no more destruction, covenant community whole.
