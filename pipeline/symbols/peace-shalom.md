## Context Bag

**ROOT CHAIN:** H7999 shalam (complete/restore/repay) → H7965 shalom (wholeness-state) → H8002 shelem (completion-sacrifice) → H8003 shalem (adj: complete) → H8004 Shalem/Salem (place = Jerusalem). Root = COMPLETENESS + RECIPROCITY, not absence of conflict. G1515 eirēnē (joining/reconnection). G1517 eirēnopoieō (peace-making, Col 1:20).

**A. ROOT & NAME:**
Gen 14:18 — subj: Melchizedek king of Salem. co: BREAD+WINE+JERUSALEM. Heb 7:2: FIRST King of Righteousness, THEN King of Peace. ORDER = principle.
Judg 6:24 — Gideon's altar "Jehovah-shalom." God's NAME = character = covenant-wholeness-giver.
Ps 122:6-8 — Wordplay: sha'al shalom Yerushalaim. Peace/Salem/Jerusalem share root.

**B. TRUE PEACE — GOD-GIVEN:**
Num 6:26 — Priestly blessing culmination. God GIVES peace. Chain: face→light→grace→wholeness.
Num 25:12 — Phinehas: covenant of shalom for zeal. Peace ≠ passivity.
Isa 9:6-7 — Prince of Shalom; increase no H7093 qets (= Dan 12 "end" word). co: THRONE+DAVID+RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Isa 26:3 — Shalom shalom (doubled intensive). CONTRAST: Jer 6:14 same words as FALSE claim. Same phrase, opposite truth-value.
Isa 32:17 — Righteousness→shalom→H8252 sha'an (quietness). KEY: H8252 = Sodom's "idleness" (Ezek 16:49). Same word; CAUSE determines character.
Isa 52:7 — Beautiful feet publish shalom = gospel = God reigns. co: MOUNTAIN+ZION. → Rom 10:15, Eph 6:15.
Isa 53:5 — H4148 musar (chastisement) of our shalom upon him. Covenant-wholeness COST him suffering.
Ezek 34:25/37:26 — Covenant of shalom: everlasting, sanctuary in midst, evil beasts cease. Opposite of alarmed-fear.
Mic 5:5 — "THIS MAN shall BE the shalom." Person = embodiment. → Eph 2:14.
Ps 37:11 — "Abundance of shalom." co: EARTH+MEEK. → Mat 5:5. SURPLUS of wholeness.
Ps 85:10 — Righteousness+shalom KISSED. co: TRUTH+MERCY. Cannot have peace without righteousness.
Ps 119:165 — Torah-love → great shalom → no stumbling. Anti-SKANDALIZO effect.
Zech 14:11 — No more cherem; Jerusalem safely inhabited. Resolution of Mal 4:6 threat. co: JERUSALEM+CHEREM.

**C. NT FULFILLMENT:**
Jn 14:27 — "MY shalom, not as world gives." co: ALARMED_FEAR. Real vs sham wholeness.
Jn 16:33 — "In me peace; in world thlipsis." Wholeness WITHIN conflict.
Rom 5:1 — Justified → peace G4314 TOWARD God. Righteousness→peace order maintained.
Eph 2:14-17 — "HE IS our peace." Wall broken; far+near in one body. G1517 active covenant-restoration.
Phil 4:7 — Peace G5432 GARRISONS (military term) heart. Wholeness fortifies.
Col 1:20 — G1517 made peace through blood. Cross = payment completing covenant.

**D. FALSE PEACE — THE LIE:**
Jer 6:14/8:11 — "Shalom shalom; no shalom." H7043 healed wound SLIGHTLY. Verbatim repeat = emphasis.
Jer 23:17 — Shalom promised to covenant-DESPISERS. co: SODOM(v14 context).
Ezek 13:10,16 — False shalom = H8602 untempered mortar on cracked wall. Cosmetic over structural failure.
Mic 3:5 — Shalom to those who FEED prophets; war on rest. Peace for sale = Babylonian system.
1Th 5:3 — "Peace+G803 asphaleia → sudden destruction." Full chain: Jer 6:14→8:11→Ezek 13:10→Mic 3:5→1Th 5:3.

**E. NO PEACE TO WICKED:**
Isa 48:22/57:21 — Structural refrain dividing Isa 40-66 into three parts. Wickedness ∥ wholeness mutually exclusive.
Isa 59:8 — Don't know WAY of shalom. Feet shed blood = opposite Isa 52:7 beautiful feet.

**F. PARADOX — SWORD BEFORE SHALOM:**
Matt 10:34/Luke 12:51 — Not negating shalom but negating FALSE shalom. Sword separates falsely-joined.
Rev 6:4 — Red horse TAKES peace from earth. War = what remains when wholeness removed.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **THREE DIMENSIONS:** Given (Num 6:26, Jn 14:27) ∥ Counterfeited (Jer 6:14, 1Th 5:3) ∥ Purchased (Isa 53:5, Col 1:20).
2. **RIGHTEOUSNESS→PEACE ORDER:** Heb 7:2, Isa 32:17, Ps 85:10. Peace without righteousness = false peace (Jer 6:14).
3. **FALSE-PEACE CHAIN:** Jer 6:14→8:11→Ezek 13:10→Mic 3:5→1Th 5:3. Each adds: false healing→cosmetic wall→peace-for-hire→eschatological climax.
4. **SODOM LINK:** H8252 with righteousness = shalom (Isa 32:17). Without = Sodom (Ezek 16:49). Same word, different covenant status.
5. **DIAGNOSTIC:** Peace divides covenant-keepers (Jn 14:27) from breakers (1Th 5:3).
6. **RESOLUTION:** Zech 14:11 no more cherem + safe habitation. Opposite of 1Th 5:3 false safety. Permanent covenant-wholeness.
