## Context Bag

**Recursive chain**: TRUTH → WORD → LAW → God's Standard/Commandments. John 17:17: "Thy WORD is TRUTH." Psalm 119:142: "Thy LAW is the TRUTH." John 14:6: Christ = THE WAY + TRUTH + life → He embodies God's standard perfectly.

**Behavioral verification**: TRUTH is actionable → you DO it. John 3:21: "he that doeth truth cometh to the LIGHT." 1 John 1:6: walk in DARKNESS = "do not the truth." Test: can you "do" commandments? Yes → keep them. TRUTH = commandments confirmed.

**Freedom logic**: John 8:32: TRUTH makes free. John 8:36: SON makes free. John 8:34: sin = bondage. Chain: sin → bondage || TRUTH/SON → freedom from sin. TRUTH = God's standard; keeping it prevents sin → liberates. WICKEDNESS (lawlessness) is what TRUTH frees from.

**Sanctification**: John 17:17: "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth." God's TRUTH = WORD = commandments → sets apart. John 17:19: Christ sanctifies Himself through TRUTH so believers sanctified through TRUTH.

**TRUTH + LIGHT connection**: LIGHT = visible example. John 3:21: doeth TRUTH → cometh to LIGHT. 1 John 1:6-7: DARKNESS = not doing TRUTH || LIGHT = doing TRUTH. Relationship: TRUTH = standard (commandments); LIGHT = visible demonstration of living by standard. Doing TRUTH → coming to LIGHT = keeping God's standard → becoming visible example.

**Antithetical**: Opposite = LIE/deception/false standard. 1 John 1:6: "we lie, and do not the truth." 1 John 2:4: not keeping commandments = "liar, and the truth is not in him" → explicit TRUTH = commandments link. John 8:44: devil "abode not in the truth" → speaks lies "of his own." If TRUTH = God's standard, then LIE = rejecting God's standard / man's way. Satan's garden lie = rejecting God's commandment.

**Substitution tests** (all pass ✓): John 17:17: "Sanctify through thy commandments." John 8:32: "God's standard shall make you free." John 14:6: "I am God's standard embodied." 1 John 1:6: "Do not keep God's commandments." John 3:21: "He that keeps God's standard." Psalm 119:142: explicitly equated. 2 John 1:4: "Walking according to God's commandments." 3 John 1:3: "Walkest according to God's standard."

**Key distinction**: Dictionary "truth" = factual accuracy. Symbolic TRUTH = God's word/law/commandments — divine standard defining reality + right living. This is why TRUTH is doable, sanctifying, and freeing.
