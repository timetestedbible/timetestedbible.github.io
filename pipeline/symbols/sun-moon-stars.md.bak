**STRONGS:** H8121 שֶׁמֶשׁ "to SERVE" → sun serves || H3394 יָרֵחַ = permanence/faithfulness || H3556 כּוֹכָב "figuratively, a prince" || G2246,G4582,G792/G798 direct parallels

**ROSETTA STONE:** Gen 37:9-10 Joseph's dream → Jacob decodes: sun=father, moon=mother, stars=brothers. Scripture's OWN first interpretation = authority hierarchy

**CREATION FUNCTION:** Gen 1:16-18 sun/moon to H4475 RULE day/night, not just illuminate. Ps 136:7-9 repeats RULE verb

**HIERARCHY STRUCTURE:**
- SUN = supreme/primary authority (generates light/authority) - Ps 84:11 God=sun, Mal 4:2 Messiah=Sun, Mat 17:2 Jesus' face as sun
- MOON = derivative/reflective authority (NO light of own, reflects sun) - Ps 89:37 faithful witness
- STARS = individual subordinate authorities/princes - vary in glory (1Cor 15:41), can fall (Dan 8:10), wander (Jude 1:13), fight (Judg 5:20)

**DARKENING ORACLE CATALOG (15 total):**
Gen 15:17: darkness + smoke + covenant cutting
Ecc 12:2: body's governing faculties failing
Isa 13:10: stars/sun/moon dark → BABYLON oracle + EARTHQUAKE
Isa 24:21-23: authorities gathered in PIT → LORD reigns in Zion
Eze 32:7-8: cover SUN WITH CLOUD over Egypt specifically
Joel 2:10-11: sun/moon dark + EARTHQUAKE + LORD's army
Joel 2:31/Acts 2:20: sun→darkness, moon→blood BEFORE day of LORD + pillars of SMOKE
Joel 3:13-16: HARVEST + darkening + LORD roars from ZION + EARTHQUAKE
Amos 8:9-12: sun dark + SACKCLOTH + FAMINE OF WORD = word withdrawn
Mic 3:5-7: sun down over false prophets crying PEACE
Mat 24:29/Mk 13:24-25: after tribulation → entire authority collapse
Lk 23:45: sun dark at crucifixion + temple veil + EARTHQUAKE = old covenant authority ending
Rev 6:12: sun black as SACKCLOTH + EARTHQUAKE
Rev 8:12: 1/3 darkened = partial authority damage
Rev 9:2: sun darkened BY REASON OF SMOKE from pit

**CROSS-CONNECTIONS:**
EARTHQUAKE co-occurs: Joel 2:10, Joel 3:16, Isa 13:13, Mat 24:29, Rev 6:12, Lk 23:45
SMOKE/CLOUD mechanism: Gen 15:17, Eze 32:7, Joel 2:30, Rev 9:2, Rev 6:12 (sackcloth=smoke)
SACKCLOTH: Amos 8:10, Rev 6:12 same vocabulary
FAMINE OF WORD: Amos 8:11 darkening = word withdrawn = Rev 11:7 witnesses killed
FALSE PROPHETS: Mic 3:5-7 cry "peace" (1Th 5:3 echo)
HARVEST: Joel 3:13 sickle + harvest + darkening = judgment-gathering
THE PIT: Isa 24:22 authorities in pit = Rev 9:1-2 smoke from pit
GOD REIGNS: Isa 24:23 LORD reigns Zion = Rev 11:15 kingdoms become Lord's

**SUBSTITUTION TESTS:** All pass - Gen 37:9-10✓✓, Isa 13:10✓, Eze 32:7-8✓, Mat 24:29✓, Rev 6:12-13✓, Num 24:17✓, Rev 1:20✓✓, Rev 12:1✓✓, Rev 21:23✓✓

**SMOKE=SACKCLOTH MECHANISM:** Rev 9:2 smoke from pit darkens sun + Rev 6:12 sun black as sackcloth = sackcloth IS smoke. Rev 11:3 witnesses clothed in sackcloth 1,260 days = prophesying inside smoke that covers sun

**WORSHIP PROHIBITION:** Deut 4:19 don't worship assigned authorities - worship the Assigner

**COVENANT CONNECTION:** Jer 31:35-36 ordinances permanence = Israel's covenant permanence

**NEW JERUSALEM:** Rev 21:23,22:5 no need sun/moon when God direct authority

**PATTERNS:**
- Darkening directed at specific nations (Babylon, Egypt) ≠ literal astronomy
- Darkening = authority collapse/removal under God's judgment  
- Physical signs may accompany but prophetic vocabulary chosen because sun/moon/stars = rulers
- Babylon burns → smoke rises → sun black-as-sackcloth → Christ appears in clouds/smoke
- Sequence: tribulation → authority structure collapses → new supreme authority (Christ) appears
- Not cosmic destruction - regime change on cosmic scale
