## Context Bag
H1870 *derek* ← H1869 *darak* "to tread/walk"; G3598 *hodos* "road, mode, means." Road = path created by repeated walking → conduct defined by HOW one walks, not location.

**TWO DISTINCT SYMBOLS:** Indefinite "a way/his way/their ways" → general conduct/manner of life. Definite "THE way/way of the LORD" → TORAH / God's commandments. Parallels TRUTH distinction (a truth = fact; THE TRUTH → commandments).

**PART I — WAY (general) = Conduct.** Prov 12:15: fool's way = his manner of living, not a road. 700+ occurrences span literal journeys + moral teaching; distinction dissolves — physical journeys ARE conduct parables. Gen 18:19: "keep the way of the LORD" = "to do justice and judgment" → pattern of conduct. John 14:6: "I am the way" → Jesus = conduct incarnate, perfect pattern of life + TRUTH (commandments embodied) + life (result of right living). Acts 9:2, 19:9, 19:23, 22:4, 24:14, 24:22: early believers = "the Way" → distinct manner of life. Acts 24:14: Paul defines THE WAY = "believing all things written in the law and prophets" → TORAH-faithfulness. Matt 7:13-14: two ways = two patterns of conduct; broad → permissive conduct → destruction; narrow → disciplined conduct → life. Journey parables: Exod 4:24 Moses confronted "by the way" for wrong conduct (uncircumcised son); Num 22:22-31 angel blocks Balaam's intended conduct; Gen 45:24 Joseph → "fall not out by the way" = peaceful conduct.

**WAY vs HIGHWAY:** WAY (*derek*) = HOW you walk (conduct) || HIGHWAY (*mesillah*) = WHERE you walk (covenant path). Isa 35:8: highway + way together → "way of holiness." Both must align.

**PART II — THE WAY (definite) = Torah.** Gen 18:19: explicit definition — "the way of the LORD" = "to do justice and judgment." 2 Pet 2:21: "the way of righteousness" || "the holy commandment" → same thing. THE way = commandments. John 14:6: definite articles significant — THE way (right conduct/Torah) + THE TRUTH (commandments) + THE life (result). Jesus = Torah incarnate. Definite phrases all → Torah obedience: "way of truth" (2 Pet 2:2) + TRUTH; "way of peace" (Rom 3:17); "way of salvation" (Acts 16:17); "way of God" (Matt 22:16, Acts 18:26); "way of the Lord" (Acts 18:25). Prov 6:23: commandment = lamp, law = LIGHT, reproofs of instruction = "the way of life" → LIGHT + WAY co-occur.

**Opposite:** WICKEDNESS (lawlessness/covenant transgression), broad way, crooked path, error.
