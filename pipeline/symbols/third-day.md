**CREATION:** Gen1:9-13 — 3rd day: EARTH emerges from SEA, vegetation/FRUIT appears. Pattern set: 3rd day = life from chaos.

**ABRAHAM:** Gen22:4 — 3rd day sees sacrifice place (MOUNTAIN). Isaac "dead" → restored. Co: MOUNTAIN, BELIEVE.

**JOSEPH:** Gen40:12-13,20; 42:17-18 — Butler restored 3rd day; brothers released 3rd day. Judgment→release pattern.

**EXODUS:** Exod3:18, 5:3, 8:27 — "three days' journey" to covenant meeting. Exod15:22 — 3 days no water → Marah bitter→sweet. Exod19:11,16 — LORD descends Sinai 3rd day. Co: MOUNTAIN, EARTHQUAKE, LIGHT, MARRIAGE.

**LAW:** Lev7:17-18, 19:6-7 — sacrifice eaten by 3rd day or burned. Num19:12,19 — purification 3rd day from death-uncleanness. 3rd day = deadline for covenant restoration from death-contact.

**CONQUEST:** Josh2:16,22 — spies hide 3 days then cross (SEA/Jordan). Josh9:17 — 3rd day discover Gibeonite deception.

**KINGDOM:** Judg20:30 — 3rd day Israel defeats Benjamin. 1Sam30:1,12-13 — David recovers all 3rd day. 2Kgs20:5,8 — Hezekiah healed 3rd day, goes to LORD's house. Co: MOUNTAIN.

**DIVIDED:** 1Kgs12:5,12 — Rehoboam answers 3rd day → kingdom splits. Anti-pattern: human answer ≠ God's restoration.

**ESTHER:** Est4:16, 5:1 — fast 3 days, approach king 3rd day → deliverance. Death-risk→life.

**HOSEA 6:2** — "After two days revive; 3rd day raise up." LXX: ἀναστήσει (anistēmi) = resurrection word. DEFINING. Co: BELIEVE.

**JONAH 1:17** — 3 days/nights in fish. Jesus cites directly (Matt12:40). Death→life type. Co: SEA.

**NT CORE:** Matt16:21, 17:23, 20:19; Mk8:31, 9:31, 10:34; Lk9:22, 18:33, 24:7,21,46; Jn2:19-21 — Christ's death→resurrection (G5154). Co: BREAD, WINE, EARTHQUAKE.

**1Cor15:4** — "raised 3rd day according to Scriptures." Points back to Hos6:2, Jonah.

**CLUSTER PATTERN:** Overwhelmingly DEATH→LIFE transition. Every narrative: subject faces death/judgment → 3rd day = decisive divine intervention restoring life/covenant.

**CONSISTENT READING:** 3rd day = God's appointed moment of covenant restoration after judgment/death. Day 1-2 = endurance under judgment; Day 3 = God acts decisively.

**ANOMALY:** 1Kgs12 — when human answers instead of God, 3rd day brings judgment ≠ life.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7992 (shelishi) → LXX τρίτος (G5154). Hos6:2 LXX ἀναστήσει links directly to NT ἀνάστασις. Hebrew שׁלשׁ root → שָׁלִישׁ (captain) = one who completes authority.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** Hebrew שׁלשׁ, Greek τρίτος, key bridge: Hos6:2 LXX connects testaments.

**SUMMARY:** 3rd day = covenantal moment when God completes judgment→life transition. Universal pattern across all contexts. Christ's resurrection fulfills/completes this symbol-pattern.
