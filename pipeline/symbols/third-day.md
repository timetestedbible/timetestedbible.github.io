## Context Bag

**CREATION:** Gen1:9-13 — 3rd day: dry land appears (EARTH from SEA), vegetation/FRUIT. Life emerges from chaos-waters. Pattern set: 3rd day = life appears.

**ABRAHAM:** Gen22:4 — 3rd day Abraham sees place of sacrifice (MOUNTAIN). Isaac "dead" in Abraham's mind (Heb11:19), restored. Co: MOUNTAIN, BELIEVE.

**JOSEPH:** Gen40:12-13,20; 42:17-18 — Butler restored 3rd day; brothers released 3rd day. Judgment→release pattern.

**EXODUS:** Exod3:18, 5:3, 8:27 — "three days' journey" to sacrifice. Separation from Egypt = covenant meeting. Exod15:22 — 3 days no water, then Marah (bitter→sweet). Exod19:11,16 — LORD descends Sinai 3rd day. Co: MOUNTAIN, EARTHQUAKE, LIGHT, MARRIAGE (covenant). Defining: God meets His people on 3rd day.

**LAW:** Lev7:17-18, 19:6-7 — sacrifice eaten by 3rd day or burned; beyond 3rd = abomination. Num19:12,19 — purification on 3rd day from death-uncleanness. Num31:19 — purify 3rd day after battle. Pattern: 3rd day = deadline for covenant restoration from death-contact.

**CONQUEST:** Josh2:16,22 — spies hide 3 days then cross (SEA/Jordan). Josh9:17 — 3rd day discover Gibeonite deception.

**JUDGES/KINGDOM:** Judg20:30 — 3rd day Israel finally defeats Benjamin. 1Sam30:1,12-13 — David recovers all on 3rd day. 2Kgs20:5,8 — Hezekiah healed 3rd day, goes to house of LORD. Co: MOUNTAIN (temple).

**DIVIDED KINGDOM:** 1Kgs12:5,12 — Rehoboam answers people 3rd day → kingdom splits. Judgment-restoration inverted: rebellion = anti-pattern.

**ESTHER:** Est4:16, 5:1 — fast 3 days, Esther approaches king 3rd day → deliverance. Death-risk→life.

**HOSEA 6:2** — "After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up." LXX: ἀναστήσει (anistēmi) = same word for resurrection. DEFINING VERSE. Co: BELIEVE, national restoration.

**JONAH 1:17** — 3 days/nights in fish. Jesus cites directly (Matt12:40). Death→life type. Co: SEA.

**NT CORE:** Matt16:21, 17:23, 20:19; Mk8:31, 9:31, 10:34; Lk9:22, 18:33, 24:7,21,46; Jn2:19-21 — Christ's death→resurrection. G5154 (tritos). Co: BREAD (body), WINE (blood), EARTHQUAKE (Matt28:2).

**1Cor15:4** — "raised the third day according to the Scriptures." Points back to Hos6:2, Jonah.

**CLUSTER:** Overwhelmingly clusters around DEATH→LIFE transition. Every narrative: subject faces death/judgment, then on 3rd day = decisive divine intervention restoring life/covenant.

**CONSISTENT READING:** 3rd day = God's appointed moment of covenant restoration after judgment/death. Not random timing — covenantally loaded. Day 1-2 = endurance under judgment; Day 3 = God acts decisively.

**ANOMALIES:** 1Kgs12 (Rehoboam) — 3rd day brings division not restoration. Anti-pattern: when human answers instead of God, 3rd day brings judgment not life.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7992 (shelishi) → LXX τρίτος (tritos, G5154). Hos6:2 LXX uses ἀναστήσει linking directly to NT resurrection language (ἀνάστασις). Seamless Hebrew→Greek→NT chain.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** Hebrew שׁלשׁ root connects to שָׁלִישׁ (officer/captain) — one who completes authority. Greek tritos straightforward. Key connection: Hos6:2 LXX bridges testaments.
