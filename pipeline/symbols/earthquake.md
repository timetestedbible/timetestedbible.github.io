**CLUSTER:** Earthquakes cluster at covenant-transition moments: Sinai, crucifixion, resurrection, Babylon's fall, Day of YHWH.

**CONSISTENT READING:** God shaking/disrupting established order. Always covenant-related: either establishing, judging violation, or transferring. What is "shakeable" = removable/unfaithful (Heb12:27 — "removing what can be shaken so what CANNOT be shaken remains"). Opposite = ROCK.

**ANOMALIES:** 1Ki19:11 — God NOT in earthquake. Exception proves rule: shaking alone ≠ God's voice; covenant word (still small voice) follows disruption.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7493→LXX seio/seismos→NT seismos. Hag2:6 quoted Heb12:26. Direct prophetic-to-apostolic chain. Same Greek word throughout.
