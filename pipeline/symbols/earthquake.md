## Translation Problem: "Earthquake" Too Narrow
G4578 seismos = violent commotion ANY domain. KJV: "tempest" Mat8:24 (sea storm) but "earthquake" Mat24:7. Same word.
G4579 seio = "agitate in any direction; throw into tremor of fear". Mat21:10 city "moved"→social upheaval. Mat28:4 guards "shake"→fear. Mat27:51 earth "quake"→ground. Same verb.
H7493 ra'ash = "undulate earth, sky, field of grain; particularly through fear; spring as locust". Applied: heavens (Hag2:6), nations (Hag2:7), kingdoms (Isa14:16), grain (Ps72:16).
H7494 ra'ash noun = "vibration, uproar, commotion, confused noise, earthquake, rattling, rushing". Nine KJV renderings. "Earthquake" = 1/9.

## Mat24:7 Reading
"seismoi kata topous" = violent commotions/upheavals across places. Includes but ≠ limited to ground-quakes.
Sword→earthquake substitution = upgrade from "direct violence" to "systemic destabilization of established order".
Hag2:6-7 lens: God shakes heavens+earth+sea+dry land+all nations. Total system disruption.

## Key Occurrences
Exo19:18 — Sinai quakes at covenant-giving. [MOUNTAIN]+smoke+fire. Theophany=establishment.
1Ki19:11-12 — Wind→quake→fire→still voice. YHWH NOT in shaking. Exception proves rule.
Isa14:16 — "shake kingdoms" = political upheaval, not seismology.
Isa24:18-20 — Earth reels like drunkard = covenant transgression (v5). [WINE]+[DARKNESS].
Jer8:16 — Land trembled at sound of horses = military invasion.
Eze26:10,15 — Walls shake from armies; islands shake at Tyre's fall = economic/political collapse.
Joel2:10 — Earth quakes = Day of YHWH. [DARKNESS]+army. [BIRTH PAINS] ctx.
Hag2:6-7 — "I shake heavens, earth, sea, dry land, ALL NATIONS." KEY DEFINING.
Ps72:16 — Grain "shake like Lebanon" = agricultural abundance. POSITIVE shaking.
Job39:20 — Horse springs like locust = physical energy. Broadest edge.
Mat8:24 — "Great tempest (seismos) in sea" = storm. Same word as Mat24:7.
Mat21:10 — City "moved" (seio) = social upheaval at Jesus entry.
Mat24:7 — seismoi = sign. [BIRTH PAINS]+famine+nation v nation.
Mat27:51-54 — Earth quaked. [ROCK] split, [DARKNESS], tombs open. Covenant transfer.
Heb12:26 — Quotes Hag2:6. "Shake not earth only but heaven." DEFINING NT.
Rev6:12 — Great seismos, sun→[DARKNESS]. [MOUNTAIN]+island moved.

## Patterns
Clusters at covenant transitions: Sinai (establishment), crucifixion/resurrection (transfer), [BABYLON] fall (judgment), Day of YHWH (consummation).
Also: storms, social upheaval, military invasion, economic collapse, political overthrow, abundance, animal energy.
God shaking established order across all domains: geological, political, social, cosmic.
Shakeable = removable/unfaithful (Heb12:27). Opposite = [ROCK].
H7493→LXX seio/seismos→NT seismos. Hag2:6→Heb12:26. Direct prophetic-apostolic chain.
Narrowing happened in English translation, not biblical languages.
What cannot be shaken remains = faithful covenant order.
