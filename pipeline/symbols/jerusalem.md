## Context Bag

DEFINITIONAL: Scripture explicitly identifies Jerusalem as person/bride/mother, not merely geography. Rev 21:9-10 → angel says "I'll show the bride" → shows Jerusalem; bride = covenant community. Rev 21:2 → new Jerusalem "prepared as bride adorned for husband." Gal 4:26 → "Jerusalem above is free, mother of us all." Heb 12:22-23 → heavenly Jerusalem = "general assembly + church of firstborn" → believers ARE come to it NOW (covenantal, not geographic arrival).

TWO JERUSALEMS: Paul makes dual nature explicit (Gal 4:25-26). Jerusalem below → Hagar/Sinai/bondage/old system. Jerusalem above → Sarah/promise/freedom/all of faith. Physical city = shadow; spiritual community = substance. Prophetic question always: which Jerusalem?

FUNCTIONAL: What Jerusalem DOES reveals meaning. God dwells there (Zech 2:10) → dwelling among His people. God's NAME there (2Chr 6:6) → NAME + JERUSALEM co-occurrence. Throne of LORD (Jer 3:17) → MOUNTAIN/kingdom connection. Mother (Gal 4:26) → produces children. Bride (Rev 21:2) → MARRIAGE covenant. Teaching source (Isa 2:3) → Torah/BREAD flows from community. Joy (Isa 65:18-19) → Jerusalem identified WITH "her people."

MARRIAGE IMAGERY: Isa 54:5 → "thy Maker is thine husband." Isa 62:4-5 → Hephzibah ("my delight in her") + Beulah ("married"); bridegroom rejoices over bride → God over Jerusalem. Rev 21:2, 21:9 → bride/Lamb's wife = holy Jerusalem.

BEHAVIORAL: Commands toward Jerusalem parallel commands toward people. Pray for peace (Ps 122:6). Never forget (Ps 137:5-6). Rejoice with her (Isa 66:10). Comforted IN her (Isa 66:13) → "as mother comforts" → comfort among God's people.

ANTITHETICAL: Jerusalem || opposite → BABYLON. Bride (Rev 21:2) vs HARLOT (Rev 17:1-5). Holy city vs great city (Rev 17:18). Free (Gal 4:26) vs bondage (Gal 4:25). Descends from God (Rev 21:2) vs falls (Rev 18:2). Mother of faithful vs mother of harlots (Rev 17:5). If BABYLON = false covenant community → JERUSALEM = true covenant community.

APPLICATION: Humans CAN be Jerusalem. Heb 12:22 → believers "are come" to it. Gal 4:26 → we are her children. Ps 87:5-6 → individuals "born in her" → born into Zion.

DANIEL 9 CONNECTION: Dan 9:24 → "thy people + thy holy city" → people = seed of Abraham; holy city = covenant community/bride. Six accomplishments (finish transgression, end sins, reconcile iniquity, everlasting righteousness, seal vision/prophecy, anoint most holy) → not about a building → about a bride being made ready. Dan 9:26 → destruction of "city" = destruction of covenant community.

SUBSTITUTION: All major Jerusalem refs work with "covenant community" substituted. Ps 122:6, Gal 4:26, Rev 21:2, Isa 2:3, Isa 65:18, Jer 3:17, Dan 9:24, Dan 9:26 → all ✓.

LIGHT connection: Rev 21:23 → "glory of God did lighten it" → community shines. MOUNTAIN: "Mount Zion" → Jerusalem = holy MOUNTAIN = seat of God's kingdom. ROCK → foundation of covenant community.

Jerusalem is not stones. It is people.
