H4421 (milchamah) ~319x from H3898 (lacham=fight/devour) → G4171 (polemos)
G4171 (polemos) ~18x NT ≠ G3163 (machē=fight/quarrel) 
H3898 root = fight + eat/devour (cf. lechem=bread) — covenant conflict vs covenant sustenance

Matt 24:6/Mark 13:7: spkr:[Jesus] ctx:Olivet || deceive + nation-against-nation + birth-pains + famine + earthquake → "not yet the end" = preliminary sign ≠ consummation
2Chr 15:5-6: spkr:[Azariah] ctx:Asa reform → "nation destroyed by nation, city by city" = OT template for Matt 24 || God "troubled them with every adversity" = divine discipline for covenant abandonment
Jer 51:46: ctx:Babylon fall → "rumors in land...violence, ruler against ruler" || judgment sign
Dan 9:26: "wars/desolations decreed until the end" || inter-advent period descriptor
Isa 19:2: Egypt → "city against city, kingdom against kingdom" = internal fracture pattern
Judg 5:8: "war in gates when new gods chosen" → idolatry→war causation
Rev 11:7,12:7,13:7,19:19: polemos = beast vs saints + heaven-war + final battle || cosmic covenant conflict
Jas 4:1: wars from desires within = internal origin
Ps 46:9,68:30: God ends wars/scatters war-peoples → cessation = restoration
Exod 1:10,15:3: Pharaoh fears + YHWH = "man of war" → positive use, covenant-war against breakers

Pattern: idolatry → fracture → war → judgment → restoration
Wars cluster around covenant-dissolution contexts
War = visible manifestation of covenant fracture, theological sign ≠ mere political conflict
"Not yet the end" = process sign ≠ consummation
YHWH wages war as instrument ≠ just symptom
Anomaly: war as divine tool vs divine judgment symptom
