## Context Bag

**H4421 (milchamah)** ~319x. BDB: battle, war. From H3898 (lacham=fight/devour). LXX renders → G4171 (polemos). Compare H7128 (qerab=battle/encounter). Semantic field: conflict, striving, covenant fracture.

**G4171 (polemos)** ~18x NT. War/battle. Distinct from G3163 (machē=fight/quarrel). Jas 4:1 polemos from desires *within*—internal origin.

**KEY OCCURRENCES (compressed):**

**Matt 24:6 / Mark 13:7** — SUBJ: Olivet Discourse signs. SCENE: Jesus warns disciples. CO-OCC: deceive, nation-against-nation, birth-pains, famine, earthquake. ROLE: descriptor/sign. TYPE: apocalyptic discourse. SPEAKER: Jesus. DETAIL: "not yet the end" — wars are preliminary, NOT consummation. CYCLE: Rome/Temple destruction.

**2Chr 15:5-6** — SUBJ: Asa's reform. SCENE: Azariah prophesies. "Nation destroyed by nation, city by city." CO-OCC: nation-against-nation (exact template for Matt 24). ROLE: judgment sign. TYPE: prophetic oracle. CYCLE: Kingdom. KEY: God "troubled them with every adversity" — wars = divine discipline for covenant abandonment.

**Jer 51:46** — SUBJ: Babylon's fall. "Rumors in the land...violence, ruler against ruler." CO-OCC: Babylon, violence. ROLE: sign of judgment. TYPE: prophetic oracle. CYCLE: Exile.

**Dan 9:26** — "Wars/desolations decreed until the end." CO-OCC: the-end, destruction. ROLE: descriptor of inter-advent period. TYPE: apocalyptic. CYCLE: Rome.

**Isa 19:2** — Egypt: "city against city, kingdom against kingdom." CO-OCC: nation-against-nation pattern. Internal fracture as judgment. CYCLE: Kingdom.

**Judg 5:8** — "War in the gates when new gods chosen." CO-OCC: idolatry→war causation. War = consequence of covenant breach. CYCLE: Judges.

**Rev 11:7, 12:7, 13:7, 19:19** — polemos: beast wars against saints; heaven-war; final battle. CO-OCC: Babylon, mountain, animal. TYPE: apocalyptic. War = cosmic covenant conflict.

**Jas 4:1** — Wars from desires within. Internal origin. TYPE: wisdom/discourse. Wars = fruit of covetousness/idolatry.

**Ps 46:9, 68:30** — God *ends* wars / scatters war-peoples. War cessation = covenant restoration.

**Exod 1:10, 15:3** — Pharaoh fears Israel joining enemies in war; YHWH is "man of war." CYCLE: Exodus.

**CLUSTER:** Wars cluster around covenant-dissolution contexts. Whenever Israel/peoples abandon covenant → internal fracture → war. 2Chr 15:5-6 is the OT template Jesus quotes. Pattern: idolatry → fracture → war → judgment → restoration.

**CONSISTENT READING:** War = visible manifestation of covenant fracture. Not merely political conflict but theological sign: covenant order disintegrating under divine discipline. "Not yet the end" = sign of process, not consummation.

**ANOMALIES:** YHWH as "man of war" (Exod 15:3) — positive; God wages covenant-war against covenant-breakers. War is His *instrument*, not just symptom.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H4421→LXX G4171 direct. Jesus in Matt 24:6 uses polemos echoing milchamah of 2Chr 15 & Dan 9. Seamless.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H3898 (lacham) root = fight AND eat/devour (cf. bread=lechem). War and bread share root — covenant conflict and covenant sustenance as two faces of lacham. Breaking bread vs. breaking covenant.
