## Context Bag

**LEXICAL FIELD**: Five Hebrew/Greek roots converge on one concept:
[H953] bôwr = cistern/pit-hole/prison (from H952 "to bore"). 50+ uses. Primary word.
[H6354] pachath = pit dug for trapping animals. ~8 uses. Always trap/snare context.
[H7845] shachath = pit as trap; fig. destruction/corruption (from H7743 "to sink"). 23 uses. Overlaps with death/grave.
[G12] abyssos = "depthless" (alpha-privative + bythos "depth"). 9 NT uses. LXX renders H8415 tehom (Gen 1:2 deep).
[G5421] phrear = well/cistern; fig. abyss-as-prison. 7 uses. Combined with G12 in Rev 9:1-2 as "pit of the abyss."

**CANDIDATE MEANINGS TESTED**:
1. Physical hole/cistern — too literal, fails prophetic/apocalyptic contexts
2. Death/grave/sheol — overlaps but pit ≠ sheol; pit has release, sheol is one-way in OT usage
3. Trap that backfires — fits Prov/Ps but fails Joseph, Isa 24, Rev 9-20
4. Generic suffering — too vague, misses confinement/release structure
5. Punishment — fails Gen 37 (Joseph innocent), Zech 9:11 (prisoners released by covenant blood)
6. ✓ **Enforced containment removing influence** — passes ALL contexts: Joseph silenced→exalted; Jeremiah silenced→vindicated; Satan bound→cannot deceive; beast contained→released to kill witnesses; demons fear it (Lk 8:31); nations go down to pit = removed from "land of the living" (Ezek 26:20, 32:23-30)
7. Chaos reservoir — partial: explains Rev 9 (smoke/locusts emerge) but not Joseph or Psalms rescue

**SUBSTITUTION TEST** (meaning: "enforced containment removing influence"):
- Gen 37:24 "cast him into [enforced containment]" — Joseph removed from family, silenced, sold ✓
- Isa 24:22 "prisoners gathered in [enforced containment], shut in prison, after many days visited" ✓
- Rev 20:1-3 "cast Satan into [enforced containment]…should deceive nations no more" — EXPLICIT ✓
- Rev 9:1-2 "opened [the containment]; smoke arose" — release of contained forces ✓
- Rev 11:7 "beast ascends out of [containment]" — regains influence ✓
- Ps 40:2 "brought me up out of [containment], miry clay" — delivered from powerlessness ✓
- Jer 38:6 "cast Jeremiah into [containment]" — prophet's voice silenced ✓
- Zech 9:11 "sent thy prisoners out of [containment] wherein no water" — covenant liberation ✓
- Ezek 32:18-30 "nations…with them that go down to [containment/powerlessness]" — removed from influence ✓
- Luke 8:31 demons beg not to be sent into [containment/powerlessness] — fear losing ability to act ✓

**KEY STRUCTURAL PATTERN — PIT ≠ LAKE OF FIRE**:
Pit = TEMPORARY. Has key (Rev 9:1, 20:1), seal (Rev 20:3), can be opened. Entities EMERGE from it (Rev 9:2, 11:7, 17:8, 20:7). Joseph came up. Jeremiah came up. Christ came up (Rom 10:7). Satan will be loosed.
Lake of fire = PERMANENT. No key, no exit. Rev 20:10 "tormented day and night forever." Pit→temporary containment. Lake→terminal destruction. Different symbols, different functions.

**THE ISA 24 ↔ REV 9-20 HINGE**:
Isa 24:22: gathered in pit (H953) → shut in prison (H4525) → after many days (H7230 H3117) → visited (H6485)
Rev 20:1-3: cast into abyss (G12) → shut up (G2808) + sealed (G4972) → 1000 years → loosed (G3089)
IDENTICAL STRUCTURE. "After many days" = "thousand years." "Visited" (H6485 paqad) = inspected/attended to/released. This is the same event described from two vantage points separated by 700+ years.
Rev 9:1-2 = the OPENING of this containment: smoke like furnace, sun darkened = DARKNESS+ released.

**"NO WATER" MARKER**: Gen 37:24 "pit was empty, no water." Zech 9:11 "pit wherein no water." Jer 38:6 "no water, but mire." Water = life-sustaining flow. Pit WITHOUT water = containment with no sustenance, no productive capacity, total isolation. Contrast: pit WITH water = cistern/well = life source (Prov 5:15, John 4:11-12, 2Ki 18:31). Same structure, opposite function based on presence/absence of water.

**JOSEPH PATTERN — DEFINING NARRATIVE**:
Gen 37: brothers→pit (silenced) → Egypt (slave/prisoner/dungeon H953 Gen 40:15) → exalted to throne (Gen 41:14,40). Pit = LOWEST POINT before HIGHEST EXALTATION. Pattern repeated: Jeremiah pit→vindicated; David "horrible pit"→feet on rock (Ps 40:2); Jonah depths→delivered (Jon 2:6); Christ grave→resurrection (Rom 10:7, Ps 16:10); Israel "pit with no water"→covenant rescue (Zech 9:11).

**NATIONS "GO DOWN TO PIT"** — Ezek 26:20 (Tyre), 28:8 (Tyre's prince), 31:14-16 (Assyria/Egypt as cedar), 32:18-30 (Egypt, Assyria, Elam, Edom, Zidon). All "removed from land of living" — stripped of geopolitical influence. Pattern: proud nation exalts→God brings DOWN to pit→nation loses world power. Connects to Isa 14:15: Babylon/Lucifer "exalt throne above stars" → "brought down to sides of pit."

**FEAR→PIT→SNARE TRIAD**: Isa 24:17-18 = Jer 48:43-44. Flee fear→fall into pit→escape pit→caught in snare. Three-stage inescapable judgment. H6343 pachad (dread) + H6354 pachath (pit) + H6341 pach (snare). Sound-alike Hebrew wordplay: pachad–pachath–pach. No escape from God's judgment net.

**SMOKE FROM PIT**: Rev 9:2 smoke arose like great furnace → sun+air darkened. Smoke = FIRE+ byproduct. Furnace (G2575 kaminos) = same word as fiery furnace (Dan 3). The pit contains fire. When opened, its smoke (= evidence of burning/judgment) darkens the visible authorities (sun+air). Connects: pit opened → DARKNESS+ spread → BEAST+ emerges (Rev 11:7) → witnesses killed → FALL_OF_BABYLON+ sequence.

**ABADDON/APOLLYON** — Rev 9:11 angel-king of abyss. H3 Abaddon = "destruction" (from H6 abad "to perish"). G623 Apollyon = "destroyer." The abyss has a RULER — destruction personified. This is not Satan (Satan is CAST INTO the abyss, Rev 20:1-3; the angel of the abyss RULES it). Distinct entities.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT CHAIN**: H953 bôwr (OT pit/cistern/dungeon) → LXX uses various renderings → G12 abyssos + G5421 phrear (NT). The physical cistern (Gen 37) becomes the cosmic containment vessel (Rev 20). Same concept scaled up. What brothers did to Joseph locally, God does to Satan cosmically.
