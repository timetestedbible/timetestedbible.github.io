## Context Bag

**IS (definition):**
Deut 17:2 — explicit def: WICKEDNESS = "transgressing his covenant." Man/woman wrought wickedness → defined as covenant transgression.
2Thess 2:7-8 — [G] ἀνομία (anomia) = lawlessness (a- = without + nomos = law). ἄνομος (anomos) = lawless one. "Mystery of iniquity [anomia]… that Wicked [anomos] be revealed." WICKEDNESS = LAWLESSNESS — Greek gives precise definition.
Two-word IS: Covenant Transgression (Deut 17:2). One-word IS: Lawlessness ([G] anomia).

**DOES (behavior):**
Isa 9:18 — "wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest." Key verbs: BURNS + DEVOURS + KINDLES. WICKEDNESS acts like fire — spreads destruction.
Isa 9:19-20 — "people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother… eat every man the flesh of his own arm." WICKEDNESS CONSUMES ITSELF — people become fuel for fire they started. One-word DOES: Burns. Two-word DOES: Consumes Self.

**Nature of wicked:**
Isa 57:20-21 — "wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest… no peace to the wicked." + SEA (chaotic peoples) → wicked = restless, turbulent, no peace. Same state as unsanctified humanity.

**Pairings:**
WICKEDNESS + THORNS (Isa 9:18): wickedness = fire (cause/agent); THORNS = fuel devoured (result/object). Lawlessness produces cursed FRUIT (thorns), then consumes even its own fruit. Self-destructive cycle.
WICKEDNESS + SEA (Isa 57:20): wicked || SEA — chaotic, restless peoples. No peace.

**Symbol relationships:**
TRUTH → God's standard; WICKEDNESS = rejecting/transgressing that standard (opposite direction).
THORNS → cursed FRUIT; WICKEDNESS produces + then devours them.
SEA → chaotic peoples; wicked are LIKE the sea.
Righteousness (covenant keeping) = opposite of WICKEDNESS.

**Dual application:**
subj: humans — can be lawless, reject God's standard ✓
subj: Satan — "the lawless one" (2Thess 2:8) ✓
subj: systems — BABYLON, false religion ✓

**Core logic chain:**
Wickedness explicitly defined (Deut 17:2) as covenant transgression → Greek confirms (anomia = lawlessness) → behavioral dimension (Isa 9:18-20): burns like fire, devours, self-consumes → nature (Isa 57:20-21): restless like SEA, no peace → conclusion: lawlessness is inherently self-destructive, explaining "no peace to the wicked."
