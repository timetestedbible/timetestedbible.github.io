## Context Bag

**LEXICAL ROOT:** H6158 oreb ← H6150 arab = "grow dusky at sundown." Root family: H6153 ereb (dusk) + H6154 ereb (mixture/mongrel) + H6160 arabah (desert/sterility) + H4628 ma'arab (west). G2876 korax ← G2880 korennumi (voracity). Raven = darkness + mixture + sterility + endings.

Gen 8:7 — subj: raven. co: DOVE, FLOOD. Sent from ark → to-and-fro (H7751 shut) over judgment-waters, NEVER returns. ≠ DOVE: no rest → returns → olive leaf (life-sign). Raven ≠ Dove :: Babylon ≠ Jerusalem :: at home in death vs seeks covenant rest. cycle: Flood.

Lev 11:15 / Deut 14:14 — subj: raven. role: UNCLEAN bird, forbidden food. Categorical exclusion from covenant diet.

1Ki 17:4,6 — subj: ravens. co: BREAD, FLESH, BROOK. Feed Elijah bread+flesh morning+evening (H6153 ereb) at brook Cherith (H3747=cutting/covenant). God commands unclean Babylon-creature as provision instrument during judgment. cycle: Divided Kingdom.

Job 38:41 / Ps 147:9 — subj: raven/young ravens. God provides for scavengers + their crying young. Provision outside covenant economy.

Prov 30:17 — subj: ravens of valley. co: EAGLE. Ravens pick out eye of covenant-mocker; young eagles eat it. Raven + eagle as judgment-agents on rebellious.

SoS 5:11 — "black as a raven." Physical beauty descriptor; non-symbolic usage. Confirms darkness color-link.

Isa 34:11 — subj: raven. co: DESOLATION, THORNS (34:13). "Raven shall dwell in it" = destroyed Edom post-cherem. Same verse: "line of confusion (H8414 tohu), stones of emptiness (H922 bohu)" = Gen 1:2 chaos-language. Raven thrives in tohu-va-bohu. Raven + THORNS = complete post-judgment Babylon landscape.

Lk 12:24 — subj: ravens (G2876). Neither sow nor reap, no storehouse; God feeds them. Provision outside covenant economy → parallel Job 38:41/Ps 147:9.

**TO-AND-FRO PATTERN:** H7751 shut = push forth/lash → H7752 shot = SCOURGE. Agents: Raven (Gen 8:7), Satan (Job 1:7, 2:2 "going to-and-fro in earth"), God's eyes (2Chr 16:9), end-times many (Dan 12:4 "run to-and-fro, knowledge increased"). Satan = raven behavior: restless, seeking to devour (1Pet 5:8), never at covenant rest.

**NEBUCHADNEZZAR = RAVEN-KING:** Dan 4 — Babylon king → beast-state 7 times. TREE hewn → eats GRASS (people) → hair like eagles' feathers → nails like birds' claws → roams field = raven-transformation: scavenging, bird-like, to-and-fro, consuming among dead. Dan 4:34-37 restoration when acknowledges heaven = Babylon-person can turn ≠ Babylon-system cannot.

**PATTERN SUMMARY:** Raven = creature of dusk/mixture/sterility. Never returns to ark-safety. Roams judgment-worlds, scavenges among dead. Babylon's spirit: restless, consuming, at home in desolation. Can be God's instrument (1Ki 17) yet remains unclean. End-times: global to-and-fro intensification (Dan 12:4). Final state: dwells in cherem-ruins with THORNS.
