## LEXICAL ROOT
H6158 oreb → H6150 arab = "grow dusky at sundown" = DARKNESS
Root family: H6153 ereb (dusk) + H6154 ereb (mixture, mongrel) + H6160 arabah (desert) + H4628 ma'arab (west)
Raven = darkness + mixture + sterility + endings

## OCCURRENCES
Gen 8:7: Noah sends raven → went to-and-fro (H7751 shut) over judgment-waters, NEVER returns to ark
≠ DOVE: finds no rest, returns to ark, brings olive leaf (life-sign)
Raven ≠ Dove :: Babylon ≠ Jerusalem :: at home in death vs seeks covenant rest

Lev 11:15: UNCLEAN bird, forbidden food

1Ki 17:4,6: Ravens feed Elijah bread+flesh morning+evening (H6153 ereb) at brook Cherith (H3747 = cutting/covenant)
God uses unclean Babylon-creature to sustain prophet during judgment

Job 38:41 + Ps 147:9: God feeds ravens = provision for scavengers

Prov 30:17: Ravens pick out eyes of covenant-mockers = consume disobedient

Isa 34:11: "Raven shall dwell in it" = destroyed Idumea post-cherem
Same verse: "line confusion (H8414 tohu), stones emptiness (H922 bohu)" = Gen 1:2 chaos
Raven thrives in tohu va-bohu desolation

Lk 12:24: Ravens neither sow nor reap, yet God feeds them = provision outside covenant economy

## NEBUCHADNEZZAR = RAVEN-KING
Dan 4: Babylon king → beast-state 7 times
Tree hewn → eats grass (people) → hair like eagles' feathers → nails like birds' claws → roams field
= Raven-transformation: scavenging, bird-like, to-and-fro, consuming dead
Dan 4:34-37: Restoration when acknowledges heaven's authority = Babylon-person can turn ≠ Babylon-system

## TO-AND-FRO PATTERN
H7751 shut = to-and-fro movement → H7752 shot = LASH/SCOURGE
Agents: Raven (Gen 8:7), Satan (Job 1:7), God's eyes (2Chr 16:9), End-times many (Dan 12:4)
Dan 12:4: "Many run to-and-fro, knowledge increased" = end-times signature: global travel + information explosion

## RAVEN + THORNS CONNECTION
Isa 34:11-13: Post-cherem → ravens dwell + thorns overrun palaces
Raven + Thorns = complete post-judgment Babylon landscape

## SATAN = RAVEN-PATTERN
Job 1:7, 2:2: "Going to-and-fro in earth" = raven behavior
1Pet 5:8: Walks about seeking to devour = never at covenant rest

PATTERN SUMMARY:
Raven = creature of dusk/mixture/sterility that thrives where covenant order collapses
Never returns to ark-safety, roams judgment-worlds, scavenges among dead
Babylon's spirit: restless, consuming, at home in desolation
Can be God's instrument (feeds Elijah) but remains unclean
End-times intensification: global to-and-fro movement
Final state: dwells in cherem-ruins with thorns
