## Context Bag

**H3677 keseh** = "fulness or full moon, its festival" from H3680 kasah = fill up/cover. SAME ROOT as H3678 kissé = THRONE. Full moon = moon enthroned = king takes his seat. KJV hides this — translates as "time appointed" in both occurrences. SLT/JPS/DRB/DBT all render "full moon."

**ONLY 2 OCCURRENCES OF H3677:**
Ps 81:3 — Blow SHOFAR at new moon + at FULL MOON (H3677) on solemn feast day. co: TRUMPET (H7782). Statute + law + testimony since Exodus (vv4-5). Full moon = 15th = Passover/Tabernacles. SHOFAR+FULL MOON bound in same command → last trump at full moon.

Prov 7:20 — Husband returns at day of FULL MOON (H3677). co: SILVER (H3701 keseph = money/price). Husband departs with silver, returns at keseh. = Dan 9:26 alt: Messiah cuts covenant, vanishes, returns. = Jn 14:2-3 groom departs to prepare place. BRIDE knows the season (full moon) but not exact day/hour (Mat 24:36).

**CELESTIAL PHENOMENA REQUIRING FULL MOON:**
Mat 24:27 — G796 astrape = "lightning; by analogy, GLARE/bright shining." Full moon rises east, light shines west all night. Only celestial body that does this. NOT random lightning.
Josh 10:12-13 — Sun+moon BOTH visible, opposite sides of sky. Sun on Gibeon (W), moon in Ajalon (E). Opposition = full moon only.
Hab 3:11 — Sun+moon stood still. Same full-moon requirement. Prophetic template for day of judgment.
Zech 14:7 — "at evening it shall be light." Full moon rises at sunset = light at evening. No other explanation.
Joel 2:31 / Acts 2:20 / Rev 6:12 — Moon→blood. Smoke/fire (Rev 18:9, Joel 2:30 "pillars of smoke") reddens visible moon. Must be FULL to observe blood-color. Not eclipse — judgment-smoke mechanism.

**H3842 levanah (the white/bright moon):** Song 6:10 BRIDE = fair as levanah = full-brightness moon. Isa 24:23 levanah confounded when 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 reigns. Isa 30:26 levanah becomes sun-bright.

**H3405 JERICHO** from H3394 yareach (moon). Moon-city falls at SHOFAR blast (Josh 6:20). Ps 81:3 shofar at full moon. Jericho = Babylon typology: moon-city destroyed by trumpet at full moon.

**Ps 89:37** — Moon = FAITHFUL WITNESS (H539 aman). Full moon = maximum reflection = maximum witness. Bride (Song 6:10) reflects the Son as moon reflects sun.

**Ps 104:19** — Moon appointed for MO'EDIM (H4150 = appointed times/festivals). Full moon (15th) = Passover + Tabernacles. Moon IS the covenant clock.

## Pattern Summary

The full moon (H3677 keseh) shares its root with the throne (H3678 kissé). The king's return IS the filling of the throne. The shofar is blown at this fullness (Ps 81:3). The husband returns at this appointed day (Prov 7:20). The celestial signs of His coming — light from east to west (Mat 24:27), evening light (Zech 14:7), both luminaries visible (Josh 10:12), blood-moon through smoke (Joel 2:31) — are all phenomena exclusive to the full moon. The moon-city (Jericho) falls at the trumpet. The bride is fair as the moon (Song 6:10). Every thread converges: His coming is at the full moon.
