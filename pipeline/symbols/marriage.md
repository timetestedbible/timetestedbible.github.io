## Context Bag
CORE METAPHOR: Marriage → covenant picture between God + His people. Husband → God/Christ. Wife → Israel/Church. Marriage covenant → Torah. Faithfulness → covenant obedience. Adultery/fornication → IDOLATRY. Divorce → covenant termination.

DEFINING PROOF CHAIN: Isa54.5 — "thy Maker is thine husband" (God = husband subj: Israel). Jer3.14 — "I am married unto you" (covenant language). Hos2.19 — "I will betroth thee unto me for ever" (eternal covenant). 2Co11.2 — "espoused you to one husband... Christ" [G] (Church = bride subj: Christ). Rev19.7 — "marriage of the Lamb is come" (eschatological covenant consummation).

WINGS CONNECTION: Ruth3.9 — "spread thy skirt (H3671 כָּנָף) over me" = marriage proposal. Eze16.8 — "spread my skirt... entered into covenant" = marriage = covenant. H3671 same word as WINGS → marriage = coming under covenant covering || WINGS = covenant/Torah reminder.

REDUNDANCY TEST (key argument): Lev20.10 — sexual adultery = death penalty under Torah. If sexual adultery → execution, marriage ends by death, no divorce needed. Therefore "except for FORNICATION" (Mat5.32, Mat19.9) cannot mean sexual sin → must mean IDOLATRY. FORNICATION ≠ sexual sin in divorce context; FORNICATION → idolatry/serving other gods.

GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE (legal framework): Sexual adultery → death penalty (Lev20.10), no divorce provision needed. Fornication (idolatry) → divorce permitted (Mat5.32, Mat19.9). Unequally yoked → divorce commanded (Ezr10.3 — "put away" foreign wives + their gods).

CO-SYMBOL LINKS: FORNICATION → idolatry (the stated ground for divorce). HARLOT → idolater/covenant breaker || unfaithful wife imagery. VIRGIN → faithful/exclusively devoted || faithful bride imagery. WINGS → covenant covering (H3671 shared term Ruth3.9 + Eze16.8). NAME → covenant relationship (marriage = taking covenant name). JERUSALEM → bride/covenant community (eschatological marriage subj: Rev19.7).

SUMMARY: MARRIAGE = COVENANT PICTURE. Understanding this metaphor unlocks divorce passages: "except for fornication" → "except for idolatry." All marriage language in Scripture maps to God's covenant relationship with His people.
