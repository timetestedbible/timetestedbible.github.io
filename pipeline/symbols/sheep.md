## Context Bag

**EXPLICIT DEF**: Ezek 34:31 — "ye my flock…are men, and I am your God" → SHEEP = men belonging to God. Ps 100:3 || Ps 95:7 || Ps 79:13 || Ps 74:1 — "his people" = "sheep of his pasture." Matt 10:6 — "lost sheep of house of Israel." Isa 53:6 — "all we like sheep have gone astray."

**STRONG'S**: H6629 *tso'n* — root "to migrate" → creature that moves in groups following leader; lexicon marks figurative use for men. H6792 alternate form. G4263 *probaton* — lit. "something that walks forward" → forward motion under direction.

**FUNCTIONAL BEHAVIOR**: Sheep HEAR (John 10:3-4, 27) + FOLLOW (John 10:4, 27) + KNOW voice (John 10:4-5) → core = dependent obedience + FAITH. GO ASTRAY naturally (Isa 53:6, 1 Pet 2:25, Matt 18:12). SCATTERED when shepherd smitten (Zech 13:7, Matt 26:31). VULNERABLE without shepherd (Ezek 34:5-8, Num 27:17). SILENT/submissive before shearers (Isa 53:7, Acts 8:32). NEED PASTURE (Ps 23:2, Ezek 34:14-15) → pasture + TRUTH/BREAD. Led in paths of righteousness (Ps 23:3) + WAY. Cannot lead selves (Num 27:17).

**ANTITHESIS — SHEEP vs. GOAT**: Matt 25:31-46 — sheep (right hand) = obedient doers who fed/clothed/visited (v.34-40) || goats (left hand) = disobedient non-doers (v.41-45). Sheep → inherit kingdom; goats → everlasting fire. Zech 10:3 — goats punished with bad shepherds. SHEEP = obey + FAITH || GOAT = self-willed + IDOLATRY.

**LOST SHEEP — STRAYING/RETURNING**: Two causes: (1) own nature — "turned every one to his own way" (Isa 53:6); (2) bad shepherds (Jer 50:6). Matt 18:12-14 || Luke 15:4-7 — parable: shepherd seeks one stray; joy over repentance. 1 Pet 2:25 — "returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop."

**WITHIN THE FLOCK**: Ezek 34:17-22 — fat cattle vs. lean cattle; rams vs. he goats. Fat cattle oppress lean → judgment within covenant community. Not all in flock behave as true sheep.

**WOLVES IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING**: Matt 7:15 — false prophets disguise as sheep (covenant people) but are ravening wolves (predators). Disguise works because sheep = harmless/obedient. Rom 8:36 — "sheep for the slaughter" → vulnerability. Matt 10:16 — sheep among wolves + NAME.

**SUBSTITUTION**: "Covenant People" works in all contexts: Ps 100:3, Isa 53:6, John 10:27, Matt 9:36, Matt 25:32, Matt 10:16, Heb 13:20, Matt 10:6, John 21:16 ✓. "Followers" too generic; "obedient" misses straying capacity; "covenant people" captures relationship + hearing/following + vulnerability + capacity to stray.
