## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**H5178 nechosheth** — copper, bronze, brass. ~139 OT occurrences. From same root as H5175 nachash (SERPENT)! Nechosheth and nachash share the root — copper/serpent connection is ETYMOLOGICAL, not accidental.
**G5475 chalkos** — copper/brass. G5474 chalkolibanon = burnished bronze (Rev 1:15, 2:18).

**KEY THREADS TO TRACE:**
- Dan 2:32,39 — belly/thighs of bronze = third kingdom (Greece). "Rule over all the earth."
- Dan 4:15,23 — stump band of iron AND brass. Both metals restrain the stump = Rome+Greece DNA persists.
- Num 21:8-9 — bronze SERPENT (H5175+H5178 — same root!). "Look upon it and live." Serpent on pole = Christ on cross (Jn 3:14). The nachash/nechosheth pun is intentional.
- Rev 1:15 / Rev 2:18 — Christ's feet like "burnished bronze" (G5474 chalkolibanon) = JUDGMENT FEET. Feet of bronze = authority to TREAD/CRUSH (cf. Dan 2 feet that are struck).
- Exod 27:2 — brazen altar = sacrifice altar. Bronze = judgment/sacrifice material.
- 1Ki 7:15-22 — Solomon's temple pillars of brass (Jachin and Boaz). Bronze = strength + establishment.
- 2Ki 18:4 — Hezekiah destroys the bronze serpent because Israel worshiped it. Bronze serpent became IDOL. Same dual-valence as gold: worship tool → idol.
- Ezek 1:7 — living creatures' feet like burnished brass = same as Rev 1:15. Judgment-throne beings.
- Job 6:12 — "Is my strength the strength of stones? Is my flesh of brass?" Brass = endurance/hardness.

**SERPENT-BRASS CONNECTION:** H5175 nachash (serpent) + H5178 nechosheth (bronze/brass) share a root. This is not coincidental. The bronze serpent (Num 21) = the serpent JUDGED, cast in the judgment-metal. Looking at the judged serpent heals = looking at Christ on the cross (judged sin) heals. Rev 1:15 Christ's BRONZE FEET = the one who TREADS on the serpent (Gen 3:15).

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive search of H5178 + G5475/G5474. 7+ candidates. Nachash/nechosheth etymological connection. Altar (judgment) usage. Temple pillar usage. Dan 2 third kingdom. Rev 1:15, 2:18 Christ's feet. Production chain: copper ore → smelted → alloyed with tin = bronze. Harder than copper alone. Middle of the hardness spectrum (gold < silver < bronze < iron).
