## Context Bag

**Etymology reveals character**: H5795 (*ez*) ← H5810 "strong/fierce"; H8495 (*tayish*) = "given to butting" (aggression); H8163 (*sa'iyr*) translated goat + **devil + satyr**; G2055 (*eriphion*) Strong's note: "symbolically, wicked person." Goat DNA = aggression, stubbornness, independence.

**1. Definitional — Matt 25:31-46**: Sheep (right/blessed/inherit kingdom) || goats (left/cursed/everlasting fire prepared for devil+angels, v.41). Goats condemned NOT for active evil but **refusal to act** — gave no meat (v.42), no drink, took not in, clothed not, visited not (v.43). Self-will = "I see, I know, I choose not to." DOING vs. NOT DOING distinction.

**2. Zech 10:3**: God's anger → shepherds + **punished goats**. Goats paired w/ bad shepherds, contrasted w/ "his flock the house of Judah." Goats = within proximity to flock but NOT sheep → self-willed refusing covenant authority.

**3. Ezek 34:17-21**: God judges between rams + he-goats within flock. Goats eat good pasture + tread rest (v.18), drink deep waters + foul rest, thrust w/ side+shoulder (v.21), push diseased w/ horns, scatter weak. → Aggressive self-provision at others' expense.

**4. Dan 8:5-8,21**: He-goat = king of Grecia (Alexander). Speed ("touched not ground," v.5), fury (v.6), conquest ("waxed very great," v.8), self-aggrandizement ("magnified himself," v.11). Goat nature → national scale: aggressive self-willed conquest.

**5. Scapegoat — Lev 16:8-22**: Two goats: 1st "for the LORD" → killed as sin offering (v.15); 2nd *azazel* (H5799 = H5795 goat + H235 depart) → bears sins into wilderness (v.21-22). Self-willed nature identified w/ sin + **expelled from community**. Reinforces meaning: rebellion must be removed.

**6. H8163 satyr-devil chain**: Same word (*sa'iyr*) = he-goat + devil (Lev 17:7, 2Chr 11:15) + satyr (Isa 13:21, Isa 34:14). Israel sacrificed to "devils" [H8163] (Lev 17:7). Satyr → Saturn → Saturday chain: Acts 7:43 quotes Amos 5:26 — Israel worshipped Remphan/Chiun (Saturn). Goat-word as demonic entity → counterfeit sabbath connection. Gen 27:11: Esau = "hairy" [H8163].

**7. Behavioral contrast**: SHEEP hear+follow shepherd (John 10:27), gentle, dependent, sent as lambs (Matt 10:16) || GOAT independent, aggressive, "butting," fierce. Matt 7:15: wolves in sheep's clothing = predators hiding among covenant people.

**Why "Self-Willed"**: Not "wicked" (too broad), not "unbeliever" (goats call Jesus "Lord," Matt 25:44), not "sinner" (generic). Self-willed captures: refusal to submit (Matt 25) + aggression (Ezek 34) + independence from shepherd (Zech 10:3) + self-aggrandizement (Dan 8). Subj: ANIMAL subtype → aggressive, independent-natured people. GOAT opposite SHEEP at judgment. Co-occurs w/ WICKEDNESS (lawlessness = self-law) + FAITH (goats = refusal to obey).
