name: HEAVEN
strongs: [H8064, H7549, G3772, G2032]
words: ["heaven", "heavens", "sky", "firmament", "heavenly", "heavenly places"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: The jurisdictional domain above — simultaneously the physical sky/atmosphere AND God's authority/dwelling; the dual meaning is structural, not ambiguous. Heaven = the domain where God's will operates without opposition (Mat 6:10). When Scripture says something happens "in heaven" or comes "from heaven," both physical and authority dimensions may be active simultaneously.
opposite: EARTH — the domain given to men (Ps 115:16), where God's will is contested; SEA — the chaotic dimension below both heaven and earth

## Lexical Core (confirmed from Strong's dictionaries + BDB)
**H8064 shamayim** — dual/plural form (NEVER singular), from unused root = "be lofty." Strong's: "the sky (as aloft; the dual perhaps alluding to the visible arch in which the clouds move, as well as to the higher ether where the celestial bodies revolve)." KJV: air, astrologer, heaven(-s). 395 OT occurrences.
**H7549 raqia** — "firmament" = properly, an EXPANSE (from H7554 raqa = pound/hammer/spread out). Gen 1:8 God called the expanse "Heaven" → physical sky = shamayim by definition.
**G3772 ouranos** — derivation: "perhaps from G3735 oros (mountain) through the idea of ELEVATION." Strong's: "the sky; by extension, heaven (as the abode of God); by implication, happiness, power, eternity." KJV: air, heaven(-ly), sky. 264 NT occurrences.
**G2032 epouranios** — "above the sky" (epi+ouranos). Used in Eph 1:3, 6:12 for "heavenly places" = jurisdictional realm, not geography.
**G4747 stoicheion** — "elements, orderly arrangements, fundamentals." 2Pet 3:10,12 the stoicheia of the heavens melt.
**G4531 saleuo** — "waver, agitate, rock, topple, destroy." Mat 24:29 "powers of heavens shaken"; Heb 12:26 "I shake heaven."
**G3928 parerchomai** — "come near/pass by/pass away." 2Pet 3:10, Rev 21:1 heavens "pass away."

BDB key distinction: "The Hebrew always uses the plural form, suggesting both the visible sky AND the higher spiritual realm where God dwells." Physical and spiritual meanings OVERLAP in the same contexts.

## Dual-Domain Structure (the key insight)
H8064/G3772 = BOTH physical sky AND God's authority-realm. This is not metaphor or ambiguity — it is structural. The SAME WORD simultaneously means:
1. **Physical sky/atmosphere** — where birds fly (Gen 1:20), where rain comes from (Gen 7:11, Deut 28:12), where fire falls from (Gen 19:24), where towers reach toward (Gen 11:4)
2. **God's jurisdiction/dwelling** — where God's throne is (Isa 66:1), where His will operates (Mat 6:10), where His dwelling is (1Kgs 8:30)
3. **Both simultaneously** — Isa 34:5 sword H7301 ravah (saturated/soaked) in shamayim → comes DOWN on Edom. Weapon physically traverses the sky FROM God's domain.

The text NEVER disambiguates because both layers are always present. Gen 19:24 "fire from the LORD out of heaven" = from God's authority AND through the physical sky. Rev 18:5 "sins reached unto heaven" = physically accumulated upward AND reached God's threshold.

## Three-Tier Structure
Deut 10:14 — "the heaven (H8064) and the heaven (H8064) of heavens (H8064)" = shamayim + shamayim of shamayim
1Kgs 8:27 — "heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee" = even the highest tier cannot limit God
Three tiers: (1) atmospheric sky — birds, clouds, rain (Gen 1:20, 7:11) (2) celestial sky — sun, moon, stars, firmament (Gen 1:14) (3) God's dwelling — transcendent domain (1Kgs 8:30, Isa 66:1)
All three = H8064. Same word, layered application.

## Heaven + Earth = Totality (Merism)
Gen 1:1 "God created the heaven and the earth" = EVERYTHING that exists
Rev 10:6 "created heaven… earth… sea and things therein" = three-part totality
Isa 66:1 "heaven is my throne, earth is my footstool" = the entirety = God's domain
Mat 6:10 "Thy will be done on earth AS IN heaven" = earth is not yet aligned with heaven → the gap is THE problem

## "Kingdom of Heaven" (Matthew)
32× in Matthew ONLY. Mark/Luke always say "kingdom of God." Matthew's Jewish circumlocution (avoid divine name). G3772+G932 basileia = God's jurisdictional rule. NOT a place; a REIGN. Mat 6:10 defines it: God's will done on earth AS ALREADY in heaven = kingdom COMES when earth aligns with heaven.

## Pattern Summary

**Heaven-earth gap = the problem:** Mat 6:10 defines it. God's will done in heaven, not yet on earth. The entire biblical narrative = closing this gap.

**Directional patterns:**
- God sends DOWN from heaven: fire (Gen 19:24), rain (Deut 28:12), manna, Christ (John 3:13), new Jerusalem (Rev 21:2)
- Man reaches UP toward heaven: tower of Babel (Gen 11:4), sins reaching (Rev 18:5), self-exaltation (Isa 14:13)
- Man ascending = rebellion; God descending = grace. Exception: Christ ascends by right (Acts 1:11), witnesses called up (Rev 11:12)

**Heaven contested → heaven purged → heaven replaced:**
- Eph 6:12 spiritual wickedness IN heavenly places (contested)
- Rev 12:7-9 war in heaven, dragon cast OUT (purged)
- Rev 21:1 first heaven passes away, new heaven (replaced)
- Heb 12:27 interpretation: "removing things that are MADE" = man-installed authority structures. Unshakeable = God's kingdom remains.

**Physical + authority = BOTH simultaneously:**
Every "heaven" passage operates on both registers. Isa 34:5 sword BATHED in the sky = physically soaked in atmosphere AND launched from God's authority. Mat 24:29 powers of heavens shaken = stellar objects AND authority structures simultaneously. 2Pet 3:10 heavens pass away = physical cosmos AND current authority order.

## Roadmap Touches
(1) RETURN OF CHRIST: heaven opens (Rev 19:11), Son comes in clouds of heaven (Mat 24:30), descends from heaven (1Thess 4:16, Acts 1:11)
(2) RAPTURE/GATHERING: gathered from one end of heaven to the other (Mat 24:31), caught up to meet in air (1Thess 4:17)
(3) FALL OF BABYLON: sins reached unto heaven (Rev 18:5), heaven-shaking = system collapse (Hag 2:6, Heb 12:26-27)
(4) SUDDEN DESTRUCTION: heavens pass away with great noise (2Pet 3:10), fire from heaven (Gen 19:24, Rev 13:13)
(5) DAYS OF NOAH: windows of heaven opened (Gen 7:11) → water judgment; next: heavens reserved unto fire (2Pet 3:7)
(6) NEW HEAVEN: Isa 65:17, 2Pet 3:13, Rev 21:1 — total replacement, not repair. New = G2537 kainos (new in kind)
(7) GAP CLOSURE: Rev 21:3 tabernacle of God WITH men. Heaven descends to earth. Mat 6:10 prayer answered.
