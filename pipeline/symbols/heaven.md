name: HEAVEN
strongs: [H8064, H7549, G3772, G2032]
words: ["heaven", "heavens", "sky", "firmament", "heavenly", "heavenly places"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: The jurisdictional domain above — simultaneously the physical sky/atmosphere AND God's authority/dwelling; the dual meaning is structural, not ambiguous. Heaven = the domain where God's will operates without opposition (Mat 6:10). When Scripture says something happens "in heaven" or comes "from heaven," both physical and authority dimensions may be active simultaneously.
opposite: EARTH — the domain given to men (Ps 115:16), where God's will is contested; SEA — the chaotic dimension below both heaven and earth

## Context Bag

**LEXICAL:** H8064 shamayim (dual/plural, ~395×) = "be lofty." NEVER singular — always both visible sky AND higher realm. H7549 raqia = expanse/firmament (Gen 1:8: called "Heaven"). G3772 ouranos (~264×, perhaps from G3735 oros = elevation). G2032 epouranios = "above sky" = jurisdictional realm (Eph 1:3, 6:12). G4531 saleuo = shake/topple (Mat 24:29, Heb 12:26). G3928 parerchomai = pass away (2Pet 3:10, Rev 21:1).

**DUAL-DOMAIN (KEY INSIGHT):** H8064/G3772 = BOTH physical sky AND God's authority-realm simultaneously. NOT metaphor — structural. Text NEVER disambiguates because both layers always present. Gen 19:24 "fire from LORD out of heaven" = from authority AND through sky. Rev 18:5 "sins reached unto heaven" = accumulated upward AND reached God's threshold.

**THREE TIERS:** Deut 10:14, 1Kgs 8:27 — shamayim + shamayim of shamayim. (1) Atmosphere: birds, clouds, rain. (2) Celestial: sun, moon, stars. (3) God's dwelling: transcendent. All = H8064. 1Kgs 8:27: even highest cannot contain God.

**CREATION/FOUNDATION:**
Gen 1:1 — Heaven+earth merism = TOTALITY. Gen 1:8 — Expanse called Heaven = physical sky IS shamayim. Gen 1:14 — Lights IN heaven. Stars = authorities placed IN heaven.
Ps 115:16 — JURISDICTION SPLIT: heaven = LORD's; earth = given to men.
Isa 66:1 — Heaven = throne; earth = footstool. Authority, not geography.
Mat 6:10 — DEFINING: will done in heaven, NOT YET on earth. GAP = the problem. Kingdom comes when earth aligns.

**JUDGMENT/TRANSFORMATION:**
Gen 7:11 — Windows of heaven opened. Physical water from sky. Gen 19:24 — Fire from LORD out of heaven. BOTH registers.
Gen 11:4 — Tower reaching heaven. co: BABYLON. Man usurping upward.
Isa 14:12-13 — Fallen FROM heaven. Five "I will" = ascend INTO God's jurisdiction. co: BABYLON+MAN_OF_SIN.
Isa 34:4-5 — Host dissolved, heaven rolled as scroll. Sword H7301 saturated in heaven → descends + cherem. co: SWORD+CHEREM+SUN_MOON_STARS.
Hag 2:6 — Shake heaven+earth+sea+dry land. Four-part shaking. co: EARTHQUAKE.
Mat 24:29-31 — G3772 5× in 3 verses: (1) stars fall FROM, (2) powers OF shaken, (3) sign IN, (4) coming on clouds OF, (5) gathering from end OF. All 5 = sky AND authority simultaneously. co: SUN_MOON_STARS+RETURN_OF_CHRIST.
Heb 12:26-27 — Shake heaven+earth (quoting Hag 2:6). INTERPRETIVE KEY: removing "things MADE" = man-installed authority structures. Unshakeable = God's kingdom remains.
2Pet 3:7,10-13 — Heavens reserved for fire. Pass away with great noise. G4747 stoicheia dissolve. BUT: new heavens where righteousness dwells. co: FIRE+SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.

**CONTEST + RESOLUTION:**
Eph 6:12 — Spiritual wickedness IN G2032 epouranios. Heaven = contested.
Rev 12:7-9 — War IN heaven. Dragon cast OUT. Heaven purged. co: ANIMAL+DECEIVE.
Rev 13:6 — Beast blasphemes heaven-dwellers. Rev 13:13 — Counterfeit fire from heaven.
Rev 18:5 — Babylon's sins reached UNTO heaven. Physical+jurisdictional.
Rev 19:11 — Heaven OPENS. Faithful+True rides out. co: RETURN_OF_CHRIST.
Rev 20:11 — Earth+heaven FLED from throne-face. No place found.
Rev 21:1 — G2537 kainos (new in KIND) heaven+earth. No more G2281 sea. co: NEW_JERUSALEM.
Rev 21:2-3 — New Jerusalem descends FROM heaven. Tabernacle of God WITH men. GAP CLOSED (Mat 6:10 answered).

**PATTERNS:**
1. **HEAVEN-EARTH GAP:** Mat 6:10. Entire narrative = closing this gap. Rev 21:3 = resolution.
2. **DIRECTIONAL:** God sends DOWN (fire, rain, Christ, New Jerusalem). Man reaches UP (Babel, sins, self-exaltation). Man ascending = rebellion; God descending = grace. Exception: Christ ascends by right.
3. **CONTESTED→PURGED→REPLACED:** Eph 6:12 (contested) → Rev 12:7-9 (purged) → Rev 21:1 (replaced). Heb 12:27: "made things" removed = man-installed structures.
4. **BOTH REGISTERS ALWAYS:** Every "heaven" passage = physical sky + authority domain simultaneously. Isa 34:5 sword soaked in sky FROM God's domain. Mat 24:29 stellar+authority structures shaken. 2Pet 3:10 cosmos+authority order pass away.
