## Context Bag

**[H6227] ashan** (noun) = smoke, lit. or fig. (vapor, dust, anger). From [H6225] ashan (verb) = to smoke. 24× OT. [H6226] ashen (adj) = smoky, 2× OT. [H7008] qitor = fume/cloud, 3× OT — derived from [H6999] qatar = "to smoke, turn into fragrance by fire (worship)" — the INCENSE root. Gen 19:28 uses incense-derived word for Sodom's smoke: grotesque inversion of worship. [G2586] kapnos = smoke, 13× NT (Acts 2:19 + 12× Revelation only). Related: [G822] atmis = mist/vapour (Acts 2:19 "vapour of smoke").

**PRODUCTION CHAIN**: Material + FIRE → SMOKE rises. Fire = God's standard applied (see fire.md). Smoke = what becomes visible AFTER contact. Outcome depends on material burned: worthy offering → sweet ascending testimony; wicked material → acrid evidence of judgment. Same mechanism, dual testimony.

**A. JUDGMENT AFTERMATH** (largest category):
Gen 19:28 — Abraham sees smoke[H7008] of Sodom as smoke of furnace. Visible from afar. CO: FIRE+BRIMSTONE. Pattern: distant witness sees ascending evidence.
Josh 8:20-21 — smoke[H6227] of Ai ascends to heaven. Signal to Israel that city taken. CO: FIRE. Smoke = visible confirmation of conquest.
Judg 20:38,40 — appointed signal: flame+smoke from city. Pillar[H5982] of smoke[H6227]. CO: FIRE. Military testimony.
Isa 34:10 — Edom's smoke goes up FOREVER. Night/day unquenched. CO: FIRE+BRIMSTONE. Permanent testimony of judgment.
Rev 14:11 — smoke of torment ascends forever. No rest day/night. Beast-worshippers. Echoes Isa 34:10.
Rev 18:9,18 — kings/merchants see smoke of Babylon's burning FROM AFAR (=Gen 19:28 pattern). CO: FIRE+FALL_OF_BABYLON.
Rev 19:3 — her smoke rose up forever. Babylon's permanent testimony. Closes the sequence: 18:9→18:18→19:3.

**B. THEOPHANY/DIVINE PRESENCE** (overwhelming power):
Exod 19:18 — Sinai altogether on smoke[H6225] because LORD descended in FIRE. Smoke as smoke of furnace[H3536]. CO: FIRE+EARTHQUAKE+TRUMPET. God's standard contacts earth → smoke.
Exod 20:18 — mountain smoking[H6226]. People stand afar (=Rev 18 pattern: overwhelmed witnesses keep distance).
Isa 6:4 — temple filled with smoke[H6227] at God's presence. CO: FIRE (seraphim=burning ones, live coal). Isaiah overwhelmed.
Rev 15:8 — temple filled with smoke from God's GLORY+POWER. No one able to enter UNTIL seven plagues finished. God's consuming standard so active that access suspended.
Isa 4:5 — cloud+smoke by day over Zion. CO: CLOUD, FIRE(night). Protective manifestation.
Gen 15:17 — smoking[H6227] furnace + burning lamp pass between pieces. Abrahamic covenant. CO: FIRE+DARKNESS. God alone walks the fire-path.

**C. ASCENDING WORSHIP/OFFERING**:
Rev 8:4 — smoke[G2586] of incense[G2368] WITH prayers of saints ascends before God from angel's hand. POSITIVE smoke: testimony of offering carrying prayers upward. H6999 qatar root connects.
Song 3:6 — pillars[H8490] of smoke, perfumed with myrrh+frankincense. Bridal procession from wilderness. CO: INCENSE. Beauty+worship ascending.

**D. DARKENING MECHANISM** (critical connection):
Rev 9:2 — smoke from abyss darkens sun+air. THE mechanism: FIRE(pit)→SMOKE→DARKNESS. Locusts emerge FROM smoke. Smoke = intermediate agent between fire and darkness. Fall-of-babylon.md: "SMOKE of Babylon's burning = sackcloth covering sun = cloud through which Son of Man comes."
Isa 9:18 — wickedness burns as fire, mounts up like lifting of smoke. CO: FIRE+WICKEDNESS. Wickedness itself produces the obscuring.

**E. TRANSIENCE/VANISHING** (simile usage):
Ps 37:20 — wicked consume INTO smoke. Material→fire→smoke→gone. CO: WICKEDNESS.
Ps 68:2 — as smoke driven away, drive them away. Wind disperses smoke = God's presence scatters wicked. CO: FIRE(wax melts).
Ps 102:3 — days consumed LIKE smoke. Transience of afflicted life.
Isa 51:6 — heavens vanish LIKE smoke. Even creation = temporary material before God's fire.
Hos 13:3 — smoke out of chimney. Listed with morning cloud, dew, chaff — all vanishing things. Ephraim's transience.

**F. ANGER/PROVOCATION**:
2Sam 22:9/Ps 18:8 — smoke from God's nostrils[H639]. CO: FIRE from mouth. Anthropomorphic: anger = burning → smoke rises from nose.
Deut 29:20 — anger shall smoke[H6225]. Ps 74:1, 80:4 — anger smokes. Verb form = active burning anger.
Isa 65:5 — hypocrites = smoke in God's nose[H639]. Provocation. False holiness irritates like smoke.
Prov 10:26 — smoke to eyes = sluggard to senders. Irritant property.

**G. DIM/SMOLDERING** (different root but related):
Isa 42:3/Matt 12:20 — smoking[H3544/G5188] flax not quenched. Nearly-extinguished wick. Messiah preserves faint testimony rather than snuffing it. Opposite of judgment-smoke: gentle preservation of weak flame.

**PATTERN SUMMARY**:
FIRE→SMOKE is the invariable chain. Fire = standard applied; Smoke = evidence ascending. Five properties used symbolically: (1) RISES/ASCENDS — to God, as testimony; (2) VISIBLE FROM AFAR — witnesses see judgment at distance; (3) OBSCURES/DARKENS — the mechanism between fire and darkness; (4) TRANSIENT/DISSIPATES — the wicked's fate; (5) IRRITATES — provokes nose/eyes. All five derive from physical smoke behavior. Dual testimony: sweet incense-smoke (worship) vs acrid judgment-smoke (destruction) — same mechanism, opposite materials. The DARKENING function is eschatologically critical: Babylon burns → smoke rises → sun/authorities darkened → through that obscuring the Son of Man appears. Smoke is the BRIDGE between fire (judgment) and darkness (obscured order). Key chain: FIRE → SMOKE → DARKNESS → SON OF MAN APPEARS IN CLOUDS.
