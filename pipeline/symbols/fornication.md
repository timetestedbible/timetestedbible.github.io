## Context Bag

**Core equation:** FORNICATION → IDOLATRY → Self-rule (rejecting God's Word). Recursive chain: fornication = the *act* of committing idolatry; idolatry = the *state* of self-rule.

**MARRIAGE metaphor frame:** God = Husband, Israel/Church = Wife, Covenant = MARRIAGE vows. Faithfulness (VIRGIN) = exclusive devotion to God. Fornication (HARLOT) = pursuing other gods/masters. Heb. "baal" (בעל) = both "husband" + "lord/master" → links MARRIAGE metaphor to lordship/authority question.

**Explicit pattern — "go a whoring AFTER other gods":** Ex 34:15-16 (after their gods) || Lev 20:5-6 (after Molech, after wizards) || Deut 31:16 (after gods of strangers) || Judg 2:17 (after other gods) || Judg 8:33 (after Baalim) || 1 Chr 5:25 (after gods of people) || Ezek 6:9 (after their idols) || Hos 4:12 (from under their God) || Hos 9:1 (from thy God). Pattern always: whoring AFTER other gods OR whoring FROM the true God.

**Critical verse — Deut 31:16:** "go a whoring" = "forsake me" = "break my covenant" → fornication explicitly = COVENANT BREAKING through IDOLATRY.

**Hosea extended metaphor:** Hos 1:2 — "whoredom" = "departing from the LORD." Entire book develops MARRIAGE + HARLOT + FORNICATION metaphor for Israel's IDOLATRY.

**Ezekiel 16, 23:** Israel as unfaithful wife. Ezek 16:26 — fornication with Egyptians. Ezek 6:9 — "whorish heart departed from me… eyes go a whoring after idols." Not literal sexual sin → spiritual unfaithfulness.

**Revelation — BABYLON the whore:** Rev 17:1-2 — kings committed fornication with great whore. Rev 17:5 — MOTHER OF HARLOTS. Rev 18:3 — all nations drunk on her fornication. BABYLON = false religious/political system → IDOLATRY on global scale. subj: BABYLON + HARLOT + FORNICATION co-occur.

**First Commandment connection:** Ex 20:3 — "no other gods before me." Fornication = violation of first commandment = having other gods/masters. TRUTH (God's standard) broken by FORNICATION.

**Substitution stress test:** Deut 31:16 ✓ || Hos 1:2 ✓ || Rev 17:2 ✓ || Ezek 6:9 ✓ (explicit — "whoring after idols") || Acts 15:20 ✓ (paired with "pollutions of idols").

**Redundancy test — why ≠ sexual sin:** Torah: sexual adultery = DEATH (Lev 20:10, Deut 22:22). If adultery = execution → no divorce needed → MARRIAGE ends by death not paperwork. Therefore "except for fornication" (Matt 5:32, 19:9) must mean something other than sexual sin. Fornication = IDOLATRY resolves redundancy. Practical: sexual adultery → death penalty; fornication/IDOLATRY → divorce permitted; unequally yoked → divorce commanded (Ezra 10:3).

**Symbol table position:** TRUTH (standard) → FAITH (following it) → FORNICATION (turning from it) → IDOLATRY (replacing it with self-rule). FORNICATION = the action/act; IDOLATRY = the underlying condition.
