## Context Bag

**Core argument**: BELIEVE = obey/commit to obey. Not mental assent but entrusting oneself through obedient action. BELIEVE is verb form of FAITH; both → trusting obedience.

**Greek evidence [G]**: John 3:36 — "believeth not" = G544 (ἀπειθέω apeitheō) literally "to disobey, be disobedient, refuse to be persuaded." KJV renders "believeth not" but literal = "disobeys." Opposite of G4100 (believe) is G544 (disobey) → therefore believe = obey.

**Parallel synonym**: Romans 10:16 — "not all **obeyed**{G5219} the gospel" || "who hath **believed**{G4100} our report?" (quoting Isaiah 53:1). Paul treats obeyed + believed as interchangeable synonyms. Obeyed gospel = believed report.

**Unbelief = disobedience**: Hebrews 3:18-19 — "believed not"{G544 = disobey} → could not enter because of "unbelief"{G570 apistia}. G544 disobey + G570 unbelief = two sides same coin. Hebrews 4:6 — entered not because of "unbelief"{G543 apeitheia = disobedience, obstinacy}. Same pattern: failure to enter rest → attributed to unbelief which literally = disobedience.

**Hebrew evidence [H]**: 2 Chronicles 20:20 — "**Believe**{H539} in the LORD → be **established**{H539}." Same word (אָמַן aman) = "to be firm, support, be faithful, establish, confirm." Believe in Hebrew = make firm/commit oneself upon. Wordplay intentional: believe (make firm) → established (made firm). Action + commitment, not passive mental acknowledgment.

**FAITH || BELIEVE relationship**: FAITH (noun) = obedience (state/quality) + BELIEVE (verb) = obey (action of committing). Both → same core: trust producing obedient action.

**James 2:19 test**: Devils believe (mental acknowledgment) + tremble — but no obedient commitment. James ch.2 argument: FAITH without works = dead. True BELIEVE = commit to obedient action. False "believe" = mental acknowledgment without commitment. Co-occurs with FRUIT (works/deeds).

**Substitution tests**: John 3:16 "whosoever **obeys/commits to** him" ✓ | John 3:36 "he that **disobeys**" ✓ (literally G544) | Mark 1:15 "repent ye, and **obey** the gospel" ✓ | Romans 10:16 "who hath **obeyed** our report?" ✓ | Mark 5:36 "Be not afraid, only **commit/trust**" ✓ | James 2:19 mental only — no obedience = "dead" ✓

**Believe → action pattern**: Abraham (Genesis 15:6 + James 2:21-23) believed → offered Isaac | Israel at Red Sea (Exodus 14:31) believed → sang/praised | Rahab (James 2:25 + Hebrews 11:31) believed → hid spies | Pentecost (Acts 2:41-42) believed → baptized, continued in doctrine. Belief without corresponding action ≠ genuine biblical belief.
