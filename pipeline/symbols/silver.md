## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**H3701 keseph** — silver, money. ~403 OT occurrences. From H3700 kasaph = to long for, be pale.
**G694 argurion / G693 argureos** — silver piece / made of silver.

**KEY THREADS TO TRACE:**
- Dan 2:32 — chest/arms of silver = second kingdom (Medo-Persia). Lesser purity than gold.
- H3701 keseph = ALSO "money." Silver IS currency. Economic dimension built into the word.
- Zech 11:12-13 — "thirty pieces of silver" = price of Messiah (Mat 27:3-9). Silver = betrayal price.
- Mal 3:3 — refiner purifies like gold AND silver. Same fire, same process.
- Ps 12:6 — "words of 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄 are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace, purified seven times"
- Prov 25:4 — "take away dross from silver, vessel for the finer." Dross-removal = purification.
- Isa 1:22 — "thy silver is become dross" = covenant people DEGRADED. Silver→dross = Dan 2 descent pattern.
- Gen 23:15-16 — Abraham buys burial cave with silver = transaction/covenant seal.
- Acts 19:24 — silver shrines of Diana = idol industry. Silver serving idolatry.

**PRODUCTION CHAIN:** Silver ore → smelted with fire → dross separated → pure silver. Isa 1:22,25 uses this explicitly: Israel WAS silver, BECAME dross, will be RE-SMELTED.

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive search of H3701 + G694/G693. 7+ candidates. Silver-as-money vs silver-as-purity duality. Dross connection. Dan 2 degradation sequence.
