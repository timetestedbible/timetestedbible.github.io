**G529** (ἀπάντησις apántēsis) — a (friendly) encounter. From G528 (ἀπαντάω). KJV: "meet." Only 3 NT passages (4 occurrences). Technical civic term: the formal reception of an arriving dignitary by citizens who go out from their city, meet him on the road, and escort him back INTO the city. The dignitary arrives at HIS destination — the citizens don't leave with him.

## Context Bag

**EXHAUSTIVE CORPUS** — G529 occurs only 4x in NT, all checked:

Mat 25:1 — subj: ten virgins. "went forth to meet (eis apantesin) the bridegroom." co: VIRGIN+LAMP+OIL+BRIDEGROOM. Parable; virgins go OUT from where they are to meet arriving bridegroom. Pattern: bridegroom is COMING; they go out to ESCORT him in.

Mat 25:6 — subj: virgins. "go ye out to meet (eis apantesin) him." co: NIGHT(midnight)+CRY+BRIDEGROOM. Same parable; the cry commands them to go out and meet the arriving one. Direction: bridegroom comes TO them; they go out, then return WITH him to the wedding feast. He arrives at HIS destination.

1Th 4:17 — subj: living+resurrected believers. "caught up… to meet (eis apantesin) the Lord in the air." co: CLOUDS+TRUMPET+VOICE+RETURN_OF_CHRIST+RAPTURE_GATHERING. Discourse; Paul. Believers go UP to meet descending Lord. Same G529 civic pattern: the Lord is descending (coming DOWN), believers go out to meet him, then escort him to HIS destination — earth. "So shall we ever be WITH the Lord" = we stay with him wherever he goes, which by the apantesis pattern means we accompany him as he continues his descent.

Acts 28:15 — subj: Roman brethren. "came to meet (eis apantesin) us as far as Appii Forum and Three Taverns." co: none symbolic; narrative. HISTORICAL ENACTMENT of the pattern: brethren came OUT from Rome, met Paul on the road, then escorted him BACK INTO Rome (v.16: "when we came to Rome"). Paul's destination was Rome. The citizens didn't leave Rome permanently — they went out, met the dignitary, and accompanied him to HIS destination. This is the only non-eschatological use and it LITERALLY demonstrates the civic escort pattern.

**PATTERN:** All 3 passages share identical structure:
1. A dignitary is ARRIVING (bridegroom coming, Lord descending, Paul traveling to Rome)
2. Citizens/believers go OUT from their location to meet him
3. They ESCORT him back to HIS destination (wedding feast, earth, Rome)
4. The meeting leads to ARRIVAL, not departure

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** eis apantesin (εἰς ἀπάντησιν) is a technical phrase. In Hellenistic civic usage, when a king or emperor approached a city, the citizens would go out to formally greet him and escort him back in. The word NEVER means "meet and leave together for somewhere else." It always means "go out to meet an arriving one and return with him."

**THEOLOGICAL IMPLICATION:** 1Th 4:17 — believers caught up to meet the Lord in the air does NOT describe departure from earth. By the consistent apantesis pattern (confirmed by Mat 25 and enacted literally in Acts 28), believers go UP to meet the DESCENDING Lord and escort him DOWN to earth. The "meeting" is the escort; the destination is HIS — earth. "So shall we ever be with the Lord" = accompanying him, not taken elsewhere.

**CONTRAST with OT "to meet":** Hebrew uses H7122 (qara') and H7125 (qir'ah) for generic meeting. G529 is specifically a civic welcome. When the KJV uses "to meet" for OT passages (Gen 14:17 king of Sodom meeting Abram, Gen 18:2 Abraham meeting the three men, Exo 19:17 meeting God at Sinai), these use different Hebrew words. G529 is reserved for the dignitary-escort pattern.

**ACTS 28:15 as interpretive key:** The only literal/historical use of G529 provides the clearest pattern — the brethren did not leave Rome. They went out, met Paul, turned around, and walked back to Rome WITH him. This is exactly what apantesis means: not extraction, but reception and escort.
