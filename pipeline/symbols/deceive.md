**PATTERN:** False prophets/leaders misrepresent God's commands → covenant people depart THE WAY → IDOLATRY. Always covenant-context. H8582 root = physical wandering → metaphor for covenant departure. "Planet" from planao = wandering star (Jude 13), same deviation concept.

**READING:** DECEIVE ≠ mere lying; DECEIVE = redirect allegiance from Torah/covenant terms toward IDOLATRY through command misrepresentation.
