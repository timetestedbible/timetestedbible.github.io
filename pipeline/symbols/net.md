meaning: An instrument of enclosure that gathers indiscriminately — everything within the sweep is captured. Used by God (judgment-gathering), by empires (Babylon's imperial dragnet), by fishermen (kingdom-gathering), and by the wicked (predatory entrapment). The net does not select; separation happens AFTER the catch.

## Context Bag

**ROOTS — EIGHT WORDS:** H2764 cherem — from H2763 charam (shut in); BOTH net AND ban. Physical enclosure = judicial enclosure. See cherem study for full treatment. ~10× as net. H7568 resheth — from H3423 yarash (possess/dispossess); a net as catching = POSSESSING. ~22× OT. The commonest "net" word. H4685 matsod — from H6679 tsud (hunt); hunter's net. Also = fortress/stronghold (same word!). Net and fortress share the concept: ENCLOSURE. ~6× as net. H4364 makmar — from H3648 kamar (blacken by heat); hunter's net (DARK from concealment). 2× OT. Hidden net. H4365 mikmereth — feminine of H4364; fisher's net. 3× OT (Isa 19:8, Hab 1:15-16). G1350 diktyon — from "to cast"; a seine for fishing. 12× NT. The workhorse NT net-word. G293 amphiblestron — from amphi (around) + ballo (throw); casting-net thrown around fish. 2× NT (Matt 4:18, Mk 1:16). G4522 sagene — a seine (large dragnet). 1× NT (Matt 13:47). KINGDOM net specifically.

**TABERNACLE:**
Exo 27:4-5, 38:4 — brazen altar has a grate of NETWORK (resheth) beneath. Sacrificial fire burns on a net. The altar = net that receives what is given to God. Burnt offering descends through the net to ashes.

**PSALMS (WICKED'S NET / GOD DELIVERS):**
Ps 9:15 — nations sunk in pit; in net (resheth) they hid, own foot taken. SELF-ENTRAPMENT.
Ps 10:9 — lion in den catches poor, draws into resheth. Predatory power.
Ps 25:15, 31:4 — pluck feet from resheth. God = net-breaker.
Ps 35:7-8 — hid resheth in pit without cause; let HIS OWN net catch himself. Boomerang principle.
Ps 57:6 — prepared resheth for my steps; fallen into pit themselves.
Ps 66:11 — God brought us into the NET (matsod). GOD uses net on His own people. Not always hostile.
Ps 140:5 — pach (snare) + resheth (net) + moqesh (gin). Full trap vocabulary.
Ps 141:10 — wicked fall into their own makmar (dark nets). Self-entrapment confirmed.

**WISDOM:**
Prov 1:17 — net (resheth) spread in SIGHT of bird = futile. Visibility nullifies net. → Prophetic warning = making the net visible → enabling escape.
Prov 29:5 — flatterer spreads resheth for neighbor's feet. Social trap.
Ecc 7:26 — woman whose heart = matsod (snares) + cherem (nets). HARLOT-AS-NET. co: HARLOT, CHEREM. Heart = snares, hands = bands, net = cherem. → Babylon-harlot = cherem-net-system (see cherem study).
Ecc 9:12 — fish in evil NET (matsod) + birds in snare. co: SNARE, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. "Falls suddenly upon them."

**PROPHETIC — GOD'S NET:**
Ezek 12:13 — "My resheth I will spread upon him (Zedekiah); taken in my snare → brought to BABYLON." God nets His own unfaithful king. co: BABYLON.
Ezek 17:20 — Same: God's resheth on Zedekiah → Babylon. Repeated for emphasis.
Ezek 19:8-9 — Nations spread resheth over lion (Judah's king) → cage → Babylon. Nations = instrument of God's net.
Ezek 32:3 — "I will spread my resheth over thee (Pharaoh)" + "bring thee up in my CHEREM (H2764)." GOD'S net (resheth) = GOD'S cherem. The two net-words converge on one target. co: CHEREM, EGYPT.
Hos 5:1 — leaders = pach (snare) on Mizpah + resheth on Tabor. Shepherds became nets for their sheep.
Hos 7:12 — "I will spread my resheth upon them; bring down as fowls." God nets Ephraim. co: HEAVEN.
Lam 1:13 — "He spread resheth for my feet; turned me back." God's net on Jerusalem. co: FIRE.

**PROPHETIC — BABYLON'S NET:**
Hab 1:15-17 — DEFINING. Wicked (Babylon) takes up nations with hook, catches in CHEREM (H2764 = net), gathers in MIKMERETH (H4365 = drag-net). v16: "sacrifice to their cherem, burn incense to their mikmereth" — WORSHIP THEIR OWN NET. Empire deifies its own power to enclose. v17: "shall they empty their cherem, continually slay nations?" co: CHEREM, BABYLON. KEY: same word (cherem) = Babylon's net AND God's ban. When God bans Babylon (Jer 50:21), He uses Babylon's own mechanism against it. Hunter→hunted.
Mic 7:2 — "every man hunts his brother with a CHEREM (net)." Societal breakdown = mutual entrapment.

**NT — KINGDOM NET:**
Matt 4:18-21 / Mk 1:16-19 — Simon+Andrew casting amphiblestron; James+John mending diktyon. Jesus: "fishers of men." KINGDOM-gathering = net-work. Disciples leave literal nets for metaphorical ones.
Matt 13:47-48 — DEFINING. "Kingdom of heaven = sagene cast into sea, gathered of EVERY KIND (G1085 genos). Full → drew to shore → sat down → separated good into vessels, bad cast away." KEY: (1) Net = indiscriminate gathering. (2) Separation happens AFTER catch, on shore, not in water. (3) Kingdom-net catches ALL kinds. (4) = harvest pattern (v49: "end of the age"). co: SEA, HARVEST, THE_END.
Lk 5:4-6 — "Let down diktyon for a draught." Great multitude; net breaking. Abundance overwhelms net.
Jn 21:6-11 — Post-resurrection: cast diktyon right side → 153 great fish; net NOT broken. Contrast Lk 5:6. Resurrection-net holds.

**POSITIVE RESOLUTION:**
Ezek 47:10 — fishers at restored river, spread cherem (nets) from En-gedi to En-eglaim. "Fish according to their kinds, as fish of great sea, exceeding many." CHEREM-NETS serve LIFE in restoration. The net that judged now gathers for abundance. co: CHEREM.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **NET=CHEREM=BAN.** H2764 = both net and ban. Same word, same root (shutting in). See cherem study. Hab 1:15 + Ezek 32:3 make the convergence explicit.
2. **INDISCRIMINATE CATCH → POST-CATCH SEPARATION.** Matt 13:47-48. The net gathers ALL; sorting follows. Kingdom = gather first, judge after.
3. **SELF-ENTRAPMENT.** Ps 9:15, 35:7-8, 57:6, 141:10. Own net catches own foot. Universal.
4. **GOD USES NETS.** Ezek 12:13, 17:20, 32:3, Hos 7:12, Ps 66:11. Not just wicked — God nets His own people and enemies.
5. **BABYLON WORSHIPS NET.** Hab 1:16 — sacrifice/incense to net. Empire deifies its own power to capture. Idolatry of system.
6. **HUNTER→HUNTED.** Hab 1:17 (Babylon's cherem-net on nations) → Jer 50:21 (God's cherem-ban on Babylon). Same word reverses direction.
7. **VISIBILITY DEFEATS NET.** Prov 1:17. Prophetic warning = making invisible nets visible. Knowledge = escape.
