## Context Bag

**FOUR WORDS, ONE PROCESS:** H423 alah = MECHANISM (penalty clause, dormant until triggered, ~36×). H779 arar = DECLARATION (judicial pronouncement, ~63×). H7045 qelalah = EFFECT (diminishment/vilification, ~33×). G331 anathema = STATUS (ban = H2764 cherem). G2671 katara = Greek spanning all phases. PHASES: covenant made (H423 latent) → violated → declared (H779) → diminished (H7045) → banned (G331). NOT synonyms but four stages of one process.

**PHASE 1 — OATH ESTABLISHED (H423):**
Gen 24:41, 26:28 — H423 as covenant oath-term. Neutral: binding agreement, not yet "curse."
Deut 29:12-14 — Israel enters covenant + H423. Penalty clause INHERITED across generations.
Neh 10:29 — Post-exilic re-entry into H423. Voluntary re-assumption.

**PHASE 2 — VIOLATION TRIGGERS:**
Deut 29:19-21 — Hears H423 → "I shall have peace" (false security) → ALL curses settle. co: FALSE_PEACE(→1Th 5:3). Key link.
Dan 9:11 — H423 POURED on Israel. Always there; violation activated it.
Isa 24:6 — H423 DEVOURED earth. Global scope: earth-covenant violated. co: FIRE+DESOLATION.

**PHASE 3 — DECLARED (H779):**
Gen 3:14 — First H779: serpent cursed. GROUND ZERO. Gen 3:17 — Ground cursed FOR MAN'S SAKE (not man directly). Curse flows DOWNHILL: violator→environment→descendants. Gen 4:11 → 5:29 → 8:21: intensifying reach.
Gen 12:3 — God H779's whoever H7043's Abraham. Two curse-words: social vilification triggers divine pronouncement. ESCALATION.
Deut 27:15-26 — TWELVE H779 declarations. "All people say Amen" = communal consent to penalty.
Deut 28:16-19 — Every domain cursed. Exact mirror of blessings (28:3-6).
Gal 3:10 — Under G2671 katara: no one keeps ALL terms → universal condemnation via Deut 27:26.

**PHASE 4 — STATUS:**
Jer 24:9, 25:18, 29:18, 42:18, 44:12, 49:13 — Recurring: "desolation+astonishment+hissing+H7045." Cursed nation DISPLAYED as object lesson. Pedagogical.
Prov 26:2 — "Curse causeless shall not come." Requires CAUSE — mechanism, not magic.
Ps 109:17-18 — Curse PERMEATES wielder. Enters bowels+bones. Boomerang principle.

**FLYING SCROLL (Zech 5:1-4):**
Zech 5:3 — H423 flying over whole earth. Written penalties self-execute: thieves + false swearers = totality. v4: enters house, LODGES (H3885), consumes timber+stones. Curse takes RESIDENCE, destroys from within. co: FLYING_SCROLL.

**CHRIST + CURSE:**
Gal 3:13 — Christ became G2671 katara. Absorbs covenant penalty on sinless one → exhausts it. = vicarious absorption.
Rom 9:3 — Paul wishes self G331 anathema for Israel. Echoes Christ's actual absorption.
1Cor 12:3 — No one by Spirit calls Jesus anathema. Resurrection REVERSED curse-status.

**RESOLUTION:**
Rev 22:3 — "No more G2652 katanathema." Every curse-word converges: H423 exhausted, H779 lifted, H7045 reversed, G331 removed. = Zech 14:11 "no more cherem." Gen 3:14 → Rev 22:3 = full arc.
NOTE: Mal 4:6 uses CHEREM (H2764), not H423 alah. Alah = warning mechanism; cherem = total-ban endpoint. Sequential.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **BLESSING–CURSE DUALITY:** Always paired (Deut 11:26, 30:19). Curse = what blessing becomes when covenant violated.
2. **WRITTEN = EXECUTABLE:** Deut 29:20, Num 5:23, Zech 5:1-4, Dan 9:11. Operates by law, not whim.
3. **DEVOURS FROM WITHIN:** Zech 5:4 enters+lodges+consumes. Ps 109:18 enters bowels. Isa 24:6 devours earth. Parallel: fire-from-midst (Ezek 28:18).
4. **GROUND CURSED, NOT MAN:** Gen 3:17→4:11→5:29→8:21. Curse flows downhill from violator to environment.
5. **VICARIOUS ABSORPTION:** Gen 27:13 Rebekah. Rom 9:3 Paul. Gal 3:13 Christ. Penalty transferable to willing substitute = redemption mechanism.
6. **CURSE→CHEREM ESCALATION:** H423 alah = warning; H2764 cherem = final execution. Zech 5:3 delivers alah; Mal 4:6 threatens cherem. Sequential operation.
7. **CURSE ENDS:** Gen 3:14 → Rev 22:3. Zech 8:13 "were curse → shall be blessing" = mid-arc foretaste.
