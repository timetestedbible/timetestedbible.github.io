[H3820] leb = form of H3824. "the heart; also (figuratively) very widely for the feelings, the will and even the intellect; likewise for the centre of anything." KJV: care for, comfortably, consent, considered, courageous, friend, broken/hard/merry/stiff/stout/double heart, heed, kindly, midst, mind, regard, understanding, willingly, wisdom.
[H3824] lebab = from H3823 labab. "the heart (as the most interior organ)." KJV: bethink, breast, comfortably, courage, faint/tender-hearted, midst, mind, unawares, understanding.
[G2588] kardia = prolonged from primary (Latin cor). "the heart, i.e. (figuratively) the thoughts or feelings (mind); also (by analogy) the middle." KJV: broken-hearted.
H3823 labab = "to be enclosed (as if with fat); to unheart; transport with love OR stultify; make cakes." Root = enclosure → the heart is the enclosed interior.

Core meaning: NOT a pump. The interior self — where will, allegiance, and response are formed. Scripture treats the heart as the organ of covenant decision, not merely emotion. What the heart holds determines the whole person's trajectory. Prov 4:23 "out of it are the issues [H8444 totsaoth = outgoings, exits] of life."

## Context Bag

**HEART AS COVENANT SEAT:**
Deut 6:5 — subj: love LORD with ALL heart+soul+might. co: LAW, SHEMA. The whole-heart command = total allegiance. Repeated: Deut 10:12, 11:13, 30:6; Josh 22:5; Matt 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27.
Deut 30:6 — subj: GOD circumcises heart+seed's heart → love with all heart. co: CIRCUMCISION. God performs the surgery that enables the command.
Deut 5:29 — "O that there were such a HEART in them, that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always." God's desire = a heart oriented toward Him.
1Sam 10:9 — subj: Saul receives "another heart." God gives/changes hearts; allegiance is installed, not self-generated.
Jer 32:40 — "I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me." co: EVERLASTING COVENANT.

**HEART HARDENED — PHARAOH CYCLE (Exod 4-14):**
20× references to Pharaoh's heart hardened/hardening. Three agents: (a) Pharaoh hardens own heart (8:15, 8:32, 9:34), (b) God hardens Pharaoh's heart (4:21, 7:3, 9:12, 10:1, 10:20, 10:27, 11:10, 14:4, 14:8, 14:17), (c) heart "was hardened" passive (7:13-14, 7:22, 8:19, 9:7, 9:35). co: EGYPT, PLAGUES. Pattern: self-hardening → God-hardening → judgment. Heart that will not yield to evidence becomes locked. Same cycle: 1Sam 6:6 "harden your hearts as Egyptians." Ps 95:8 / Heb 3:8, 3:15, 4:7 "harden not your hearts as in the provocation." 2Chr 36:13 Zedekiah. Prov 28:14 "he that hardeneth his heart shall fall." Mark 6:52, 8:17 disciples' hearts hardened → can't perceive. John 12:40 / Matt 13:15 / Acts 28:27 (=Isa 6:10) "heart waxed gross...lest they understand with their heart and be converted."

**HEART AS WRITING SURFACE:**
Prov 3:3 — "write [mercy+truth] upon the table of thine heart." co: TABLET.
Prov 7:3 — "write them upon the table of thine heart."
Jer 17:1 — "sin of Judah written with pen of iron...upon the table of their heart." SIN also gets written there.
Jer 31:33 — NEW COVENANT: "I will put my law in their inward parts, write it in their hearts." co: LAW, COVENANT. = Heb 8:10, 10:16. Heart replaces stone tablets.
2Cor 3:3 — "epistle of Christ...written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart." STONE→FLESH transition explicit.
Rom 2:15 — "work of the law written in their hearts, conscience bearing witness."

**HEART TRANSFORMED — EZEKIEL'S NEW HEART:**
Ezek 11:19 — "one heart...new spirit...take stony heart out of their flesh, give heart of flesh." co: SPIRIT, STONE.
Ezek 18:31 — "make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die?"
Ezek 36:26 — "NEW heart...new spirit within you...take away STONY heart out of your flesh...give you heart of FLESH." DEFINING: stone = unresponsive to covenant pressure. Flesh = alive, responsive. Same fire refines flesh-heart, destroys stone-heart. co: FIRE, SPIRIT, ROCK.
Ps 51:10 — "Create in me a CLEAN heart, O God; renew a right SPIRIT within me." Heart+spirit paired.
Ps 51:17 — "broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise." God values the heart that has cracked open, not the stone that resists.
Isa 57:15 — God dwells with "contrite and humble spirit...revive the heart of the contrite ones."

**HEART CIRCUMCISED:**
Deut 10:16 — "circumcise the foreskin of your heart, be no more stiffnecked." co: CIRCUMCISION.
Deut 30:6 — GOD circumcises heart. Same act: human command (10:16) → divine gift (30:6).
Jer 4:4 — "circumcise yourselves to the LORD, take away foreskins of your heart...lest my fury come forth like fire." co: FIRE. Uncircumcised heart = fuel.
Jer 9:26 — "all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart."
Ezek 44:7, 9 — uncircumcised in heart banned from sanctuary.
Acts 7:51 — "uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost."
Rom 2:29 — "circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter."

**HEART AS SOURCE — WHAT COMES OUT:**
Gen 6:5 — "every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually." co: DAYS_OF_NOAH. Pre-flood condition = heart-generated wickedness.
Gen 8:21 — "imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." Post-flood: unchanged heart.
Jer 17:9-10 — "the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I the LORD search the heart." ONLY God can diagnose.
Matt 12:34-35 — "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh." Good treasure → good things. Evil treasure → evil things.
Matt 15:18-19 / Mark 7:21-23 — "out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries..." Heart is SOURCE, not recipient, of defilement.
Prov 4:23 — "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." Guard the source.
Luke 8:15 — "honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit." Heart = soil type.

**HEART FAINT — ALARMED-FEAR CONNECTION:**
Gen 45:26 — Jacob's "heart fainted" at news of Joseph. H3820 + H6313 = heart went numb.
Deut 20:8 — fainthearted → "lest his brethren's heart H3824-faint." Fear contagion through heart.
Isa 1:5 — "whole heart faint." co: REBELLION, SICKNESS.
Jer 51:46 — "lest your heart H3824-faint, and ye fear for the rumour...ruler against ruler." co: ALARMED_FEAR, BABYLON, WARS_AND_RUMORS. The Babylon-oracle warns: don't let heart respond with panic. SAME vocabulary Jesus uses Matt 24:6 / John 14:1.
John 14:1, 27 — "Let not your heart be G5015-troubled." co: PEACE_SHALOM. Antidote = "my peace I give unto you." Heart-trouble is the prohibited response for those who recognize God's hand.

**HEART AND TREASURE:**
Matt 6:21 — "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." Heart follows investment.
Matt 5:8 — "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
1Tim 1:5 — "charity out of a pure heart + good conscience + faith unfeigned."
2Tim 2:22 — "call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
1Pet 1:22 — "love one another with a pure heart fervently."
Phil 4:7 — "peace of God...shall keep [G5432 phroureo = garrison] your hearts and minds." Peace GARRISONS the heart.

PATTERN SUMMARY:
Heart = covenant-response organ. It can be: (1) hardened=stone → resists all evidence, locked by repetition (Pharaoh cycle), (2) circumcised → covering removed, exposed to God, (3) broken/contrite → cracked open, receptive, valued by God, (4) written upon → receives law/sin/Spirit as inscription, (5) faint/troubled → alarm-response when allegiance is uncertain, (6) pure/clean → single allegiance, sees God.

The TRAJECTORY: stone→circumcised→broken→inscribed→flesh. Ezek 36:26 = the full arc. God replaces the unresponsive organ with a living one, then writes covenant on it (Jer 31:33). This IS the new covenant mechanism. Heart of stone = Egypt/Pharaoh. Heart of flesh = new creation.

Heart is where ALLEGIANCE lives. Not emotion. Deut 6:5 commands total allegiance. Jer 17:9 reveals the heart's native treachery. Ezek 36:26 promises God's surgical intervention. The heart that remains stone self-destructs under covenant fire (Jer 4:4). The heart made flesh becomes the tablet of the new covenant.
