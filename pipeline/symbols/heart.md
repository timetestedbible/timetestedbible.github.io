[H3820] leb = form of H3824. "the heart; also (figuratively) very widely for the feelings, the will and even the intellect; likewise for the centre of anything." KJV: care for, comfortably, consent, considered, courageous, friend, broken/hard/merry/stiff/stout/double heart, heed, kindly, midst, mind, regard, understanding, willingly, wisdom.
[H3824] lebab = from H3823 labab. "the heart (as the most interior organ)." KJV: bethink, breast, comfortably, courage, faint/tender-hearted, midst, mind, unawares, understanding.
[G2588] kardia = prolonged from primary (Latin cor). "the heart, i.e. (figuratively) the thoughts or feelings (mind); also (by analogy) the middle." KJV: broken-hearted.
H3823 labab = "to be enclosed (as if with fat); to unheart; transport with love OR stultify; make cakes." Root = enclosure → the heart is the enclosed interior.

Core meaning: NOT a pump. The interior self — where will, allegiance, and response are formed. Scripture treats the heart as the organ of covenant decision, not merely emotion. What the heart holds determines the whole person's trajectory. Prov 4:23 "out of it are the issues [H8444 totsaoth = outgoings, exits] of life."

## Context Bag

**COVENANT SEAT:**
Deut 6:5 — subj: love LORD with ALL heart+soul+might. co: LAW, SHEMA. Total allegiance command. Repeated: Deut 10:12, 11:13, 30:6; Josh 22:5; Matt 22:37; Mk 12:30; Lk 10:27.
Deut 30:6 — subj: GOD circumcises heart → love with all heart. co: CIRCUMCISION. God performs what He commands.
Deut 5:29 — "O that there were such a HEART in them." God's desire = heart oriented toward Him.
1Sam 10:9 — Saul receives "another heart." Allegiance installed, not self-generated.
Jer 32:40 — "put my fear in their hearts, shall not depart." co: EVERLASTING COVENANT.

**HARDENED — PHARAOH CYCLE (Exod 4-14):**
20× Pharaoh's heart hardened. Three agents: (a) self-hardens (8:15, 8:32, 9:34), (b) God hardens (4:21, 7:3, 9:12, 10:1, 10:20, 10:27, 11:10, 14:4,8,17), (c) passive "was hardened" (7:13-14, 7:22, 8:19, 9:7, 9:35). co: EGYPT, PLAGUES. Pattern: self→God→judgment. Heart refusing evidence becomes locked. Same: 1Sam 6:6, Ps 95:8 / Heb 3:8,15, 4:7, Prov 28:14, Mk 6:52, 8:17, Jn 12:40 / Matt 13:15 / Acts 28:27 (=Isa 6:10).

**WRITING SURFACE:**
Prov 3:3, 7:3 — write mercy+truth on heart. co: TABLET. Jer 17:1 — sin also written with iron pen.
Jer 31:33 — NEW COVENANT: law written in hearts. = Heb 8:10, 10:16. Heart replaces stone tablets.
2Cor 3:3 — not stone tables but fleshy tables of heart. STONE→FLESH explicit. Rom 2:15 — law written, conscience witnesses.

**TRANSFORMED — NEW HEART:**
Ezek 11:19 — one heart, new spirit, stony→flesh. Ezek 18:31 — make new heart. Ezek 36:26 — DEFINING: STONY heart removed, FLESH heart given. co: FIRE, SPIRIT, ROCK. Stone = unresponsive; flesh = alive. Same fire refines flesh, destroys stone.
Ps 51:10 — clean heart + right spirit paired. Ps 51:17 — broken+contrite heart not despised. Isa 57:15 — God dwells with contrite, revives heart.

**CIRCUMCISED:**
Deut 10:16 — circumcise heart (human command). Deut 30:6 — GOD circumcises (divine gift). Same act, two agents.
Jer 4:4 — circumcise to LORD, lest fury as fire. co: FIRE. Uncircumcised heart = fuel.
Jer 9:26, Ezek 44:7,9, Acts 7:51 — uncircumcised heart = resists Spirit, banned from sanctuary. Rom 2:29 — circumcision of heart, in spirit.

**SOURCE — WHAT COMES OUT:**
Gen 6:5 — imagination of heart evil continually. co: DAYS_OF_NOAH. Gen 8:21 — evil from youth (post-flood: unchanged).
Jer 17:9-10 — heart deceitful, desperately wicked. ONLY God searches it.
Matt 12:34-35 — abundance of heart → mouth speaks. Matt 15:18-19 / Mk 7:21-23 — heart = SOURCE of defilement.
Prov 4:23 — keep heart; out of it = issues (H8444 totsaoth) of life. Lk 8:15 — honest heart keeps word, bears fruit. Heart = soil type.

**FAINT — ALARMED-FEAR:**
Gen 45:26 — Jacob's heart fainted. Deut 20:8 — fainthearted contagion.
Jer 51:46 — "lest heart faint, fear for rumour, ruler against ruler." co: ALARMED_FEAR, BABYLON, WARS_AND_RUMORS. = Matt 24:6 / John 14:1 vocabulary.
Jn 14:1,27 — "Let not heart be troubled." co: PEACE_SHALOM. Peace = antidote.

**TREASURE/PURITY:**
Matt 6:21 — treasure→heart follows. Matt 5:8 — pure heart sees God. Phil 4:7 — peace GARRISONS (G5432) hearts. 1Tim 1:5, 2Tim 2:22, 1Pet 1:22.

**PATTERNS**: Heart = covenant-response organ. Six states: (1) hardened/stone → locked by repetition (Pharaoh); (2) circumcised → covering removed; (3) broken/contrite → cracked open, valued by God; (4) written upon → receives law/sin/Spirit; (5) faint/troubled → alarm when allegiance uncertain; (6) pure → single allegiance, sees God. TRAJECTORY: stone→circumcised→broken→inscribed→flesh. Ezek 36:26 = full arc. Heart of stone = Egypt/Pharaoh. Heart of flesh = new covenant tablet (Jer 31:33). Allegiance lives here, not emotion.
