## Context Bag

**Core meaning**: MOMENT → sudden falling of divine judgment/destruction; the instant God's evaluation results in swift action. Imports subj: divine reckoning into any passage where it appears.

**1. Accompanying ACTIONS (verb evidence)**:
Num 16:21,45 → CONSUME in a moment; Job 21:13 → GO DOWN TO GRAVE in a moment; Job 34:20 → DIE in a moment; Ps 73:19 → DESOLATION as in a moment; Isa 47:9 → loss/widowhood COME in a moment; Jer 4:20 → DESTRUCTION in a moment; Lam 4:6 → OVERTHROWN as in a moment; 1Cor 15:52 → CHANGED in a moment. Dominant verbs = consume, destroy, die, overthrow, desolation, changed — all judgment actions.

**2. Dominant pattern**: ~70% of uses = sudden destruction/judgment (Num 16, Job 21, Job 34, Ps 73, Isa 47, Jer 4, Lam 4). ~30% = contrast-with-eternal (Ps 30:5, Isa 54:7-8, 2Cor 4:17). Contrast uses are *applications* of same idea — God's judgment is brief vs. His mercy is everlasting. Even secondary pattern presupposes judgment is in view.

**3. Imported context**: "Moment" imports divine evaluation + swift execution + sudden consequence. Example: Isa 54:7 "For a small moment have I forsaken thee" → "For a brief judgment have I forsaken thee — but with everlasting kindness will I gather thee." The word signals JUDGMENT is the subject.

**4. Why "temporary" fails**: "Temporary" = literal dictionary synonym, not symbolic meaning. Symbolic meaning revealed by: accompanying verbs (judgment actions) + imported context (divine reckoning) + described event (falling of judgment). Must push past literal definition → functional/event-based meaning.

**5. Co-occurring symbol connections**: ROCK (Covenant) → what endures BEYOND moment of judgment; SAND (Multitudes at Covenant Boundary) → what does NOT survive moment of judgment; TRUTH (God's Standard) → standard by which moment of judgment evaluates; SLEEP (Death/Unaware) → state before awakening to judgment. Moment = when judgment falls; built on ROCK survives || built on SAND does not.

**6. Substitution stress test** (all pass ✓): Num 16:21 "consume them in sudden judgment"; Job 34:20 "In sudden judgment shall they die"; Ps 73:19 "desolation, as in sudden judgment"; Isa 47:9 "come to thee in sudden judgment"; Ps 30:5 "anger but a brief judgment"; Isa 54:7 "brief judgment… forsaken"; 1Cor 15:52 "in the instant of judgment… transformed."

**Method**: (1) Look at accompanying actions → verbs reveal symbolic import; (2) Follow dominant pattern → don't let secondary uses distract; (3) Words import context → "moment" brings divine judgment into passage; (4) Test for literal synonyms → reject dictionary meaning as symbolic meaning.
