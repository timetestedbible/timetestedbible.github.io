## Context Bag

**Production chain (physical → symbolic):**
OLIVE TREE (TREE → covenant community, Rom 11:17-24) → bears OLIVES (FRUIT → works/deeds) → PRESSED/CRUSHED (trials/testing) → OIL extracted (proven works). Each stage maps: source=covenant people, fruit=works, process=trials, product=proven works.

**OIL ≠ Spirit proof:**
Matt 25:9 — virgins told "go **buy**" oil → oil is acquirable through effort. Acts 8:20 — Spirit **cannot be purchased** ("thy money perish with thee"). Spirit = gift; oil = earned through tested faithfulness. Therefore OIL → proven works, not Spirit.

**Parable of Ten Virgins (Matt 25:3-4, 25:8-9):**
WISE VIRGINS (VIRGIN → faithful/exclusively devoted) had oil = had reserves of proven works built through tested obedience. FOOLISH had no oil = no proven works. "Cannot borrow" = cannot use another's track record. Works must be one's own.

**Gethsemane etymology:**
Gethsemane = "oil press" [H]. Jesus pressed/crushed in the garden of the Oil Press (Luke 22:44) before crucifixion → ultimate trial producing ultimate proven work. Place-name encodes symbol: pressing → proven works.

**Lamp-use chain (OIL → LIGHT):**
Oil burnt in lamps → visible LIGHT (LIGHT → example/visible obedience). Proven works, when spent in witness + obedience, become visible example to others → "light on the stand" (Matt 5:14-16). Exod 27:20 — pure beaten olive oil for the lamp to burn continually. OIL (proven works) + LAMP → LIGHT (visible testimony). Same oil that sustains the lamp is what makes light visible.

**Co-occurrence notes:**
TREE (olive tree = covenant community, Rom 11) || FRUIT (olives = works) + OIL (pressed fruit = proven works). VIRGIN (Matt 25 parable: wise/foolish virgins). LIGHT (oil burnt → visible example, Matt 5:14-16). BREAD + WINE (covenant meal elements parallel oil as covenant-life symbol). FAITH (tested faithfulness produces proven works through trials).

**Summary logic:**
OIL = proven works because: (1) produced by pressing fruit of covenant tree → works tested through trials; (2) can be bought ≠ Spirit which is gift; (3) cannot be borrowed → personal track record; (4) burnt → produces LIGHT = visible obedience/example.
