## Context Bag

**Core thesis**: BABYLON = Worldly Kingdom — man's substitute system for God's covenant rule. NOT "confusion" (that is result/judgment, not essence). Babylon IS the kingdom built on human authority + effort; confusion is what follows rejecting God's rule.

**Key argument — Brick vs. Stone (Gen 11:3)**:
"they had BRICK for STONE" → BRICK = man-made substitute || STONE = God-given ROCK (→ covenant). Babylon uses human substitutes for what only God provides. BRICK + ROCK co-occur as opposites: human effort vs. divine provision.

**Self-made covenant (Gen 11:4)**:
"let us make us a NAME" → NAME = covenant. Self-made NAME = self-authority, self-covenant. Contrasts God *giving* His NAME to His people. Man reaching up || God coming down.

**Babylon claims deity (Isa 47:8)**:
"I am, and none else beside me" → Babylon claims to BE God. Parodies "I AM" (true God). subj: Babylon as counterfeit divine authority.

**Human glory (Dan 4:30)**:
"I have built by MY power for MY majesty" → human achievement, human glory. Kingdom built on self, not God.

**Mother of all idolatry (Rev 17:5)**:
"MOTHER OF HARLOTS" → HARLOT = idolater/covenant breaker + FORNICATION = idolatry/serving idols. All IDOLATRY (→ self-rule/rejecting God's word) flows from choosing man's kingdom over God's. Babylon is the SOURCE, the mother-system from which all false worship derives.

**Six-fold contrast table**:
BABYLON || JERUSALEM:
- Man's authority || God's authority
- Brick (man-made) || Stone (God-given → ROCK/covenant)
- Our name || God's NAME (→ covenant)
- Man reaching up || God coming down
- Works || Grace
- "I am, none else" || "I AM" (true God)
- MOUNTAIN as worldly ruling authority || MOUNTAIN as heavenly ruling authority

**Characterization summary**:
1. Human authority replacing God's
2. Human effort (brick) replacing divine provision (stone/ROCK)
3. Self-made covenant (NAME) replacing God's covenant
4. Works salvation — man reaching up
5. Source of all IDOLATRY → HARLOT + FORNICATION

BABYLON → opposite of JERUSALEM (→ Bride/covenant community). All idol systems trace back to Babylon's foundational rejection: substituting human kingdom for God's kingdom.
