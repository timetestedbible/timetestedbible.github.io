BABYLON = Worldly Kingdom — man's substitute system for God's covenant rule. ≠ "confusion" (result/judgment, not essence).

**BABYLON'S SYNONYMS — ONE SYSTEM, FIVE NAMES:**
- SHINAR [H8152] → Babylon's origin-name. Gen 10:10 + 11:2. Zech 5:11 wickedness returns to birthplace.
- EGYPT → First Babylon-pattern. Pharaoh: "my river is mine" (Ezek 29:3) = Isa 47:8 self-deification. Nation-vs-nation (Isa 19:2), sorceries, wine/stupor judgment.
- Rev 11:8 → "great city SPIRITUALLY called Sodom + Egypt where Lord crucified." Names = functional, ≠ geographic.
- TYRE → Babylon's commercial face. Ezek 27 = template for Rev 18. "I am God in seat of God" (Ezek 28:2). Fire FROM WITHIN (28:18).
- SODOM → Babylon's moral face. Lot extracted = "come out my people" pattern.

**KEY CONTRASTS — BABYLON || JERUSALEM:**
- Man's authority || God's authority
- BRICK (man-made) || STONE (God-given/ROCK/covenant) — Gen 11:3
- Our NAME || God's NAME (covenant) — Gen 11:4
- Man reaching up || God coming down
- "I am, none else" || "I AM" (true God) — Isa 47:8
- THORNS (cursed) || FRUIT (covenant produce)
- Merchants/trade || Worship/offerings
- Enslaves || Liberates

**THORNS → BABYLON CONNECTION:**
THORNS = worldly people w/ "cares, riches, pleasures" (Luke 8:14) who compose Babylon's population.
Isa 9:18 → WICKEDNESS burns as fire → devours THORNS + BRIERS → smoke rises = Rev 18:9.
Isa 10:17 → thorns/briers burned "IN ONE DAY" = Rev 18:8.
Babylon produces + then consumes its own people.

**WICKEDNESS AS BABYLON'S PAYLOAD:**
Zech 5:1-4 → flying scroll = delivery mechanism (curse).
Zech 5:5-11 → woman = WICKEDNESS [H7564] sealed in ephah → transported to SHINAR.
WICKEDNESS generated by Babylon → returned to Babylon as judgment.
Self-consumption: Ezek 28:18 "fire FROM THE MIDST OF THEE."

**COMMERCIAL DIMENSION:**
Rev 18 = Ezek 27 at global scale.
Tyre corrupted by "traffick" [H7404] — commerce corrupted covering cherub (Ezek 28:16-18).
Merchants weep (Ezek 27:36 → Rev 18:11), maritime destruction, luxury catalogs match.

**JUDGMENT PATTERN:**
All synonyms share: self-deification → sudden fire destruction → extraction of God's people.
Babylon burns using its own wickedness/thorns as fuel.
System returns to consume what it produced.
