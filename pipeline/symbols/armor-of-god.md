G4030 perikephalaia 2× (Eph 6:17, 1Th 5:8) = peri+kephale. G2375 thureos 1× (Eph 6:16) from G2374 thura = door. G2223 zone 8× = belt/purse. G5266 hupodema 10× = sandal.

1Th 5:8 — Paul transfers armor to believers: breastplate = faith+love, helmet = hope-of-salvation. Day/night context (v5-8). co: DAY, NIGHT, FAITH, SLEEP.
Eph 6:11-17 — Full panoplia: truth-belt (G2223), righteousness-breastplate (G2382), gospel-peace-sandals (G5266+G2091), faith-shield (G2375), salvation-helmet (G4030), Spirit-sword (G3162 = G4487 Word). Every piece = another symbol.

2Cor 6:7 — Armor (G3696) of righteousness, right hand + left = offensive AND defensive.
Lk 11:22 — Strong man's panoplia. Christ = Stronger who strips Satan's armor + distributes spoils. ANTI-armor.

**PATTERNS:**
1. GOD-FIRST TRANSFER: Isa 59:17 God wears → 1Th 5:8 / Eph 6:11 believers receive. Armor = GOD'S attributes given.
2. COMPOSITE SYMBOL: every piece = existing symbol (truth, righteousness, gospel, faith, salvation, Word). Armor = sum of covenant identity.
3. SHIELD=DOOR: G2375 from G2374 thura. Defense IS the entrance. Faith opens AND protects.
4. PUT ON = CLOTHE IN CHRIST: G1746 endyo for armor (Eph 6:11) = putting on Christ (Gal 3:27, Rom 13:14). The armor IS Christ.
5. DAY/NIGHT CLOTHING: Rom 13:12 + 1Th 5:8 — armor belongs to DAY. Unarmed = night/sleep/darkness.
6. TWO COMPETING ARMOR-SETS: Strong man's panoplia (Lk 11:22), demonic breastplates (Rev 9:9,17) vs God's panoplia. Whose armor you wear = whose side you fight on.
