[H8577] tanniyn / tannim = intensive from H8565 tan (= monster, elongated creature). "a marine or land monster, i.e. sea-serpent or jackal." KJV: dragon, sea-monster, serpent, whale.
[H8565] tan = from unused root meaning "to elongate." "a monster (preternaturally formed), i.e. a sea-serpent or huge marine animal; also a jackal." KJV: dragon, whale.
[G1404] drakon = probably from alternate form of derkomai (to look/see). "a fabulous kind of serpent (perhaps as supposed to fascinate)." KJV: dragon.
RELATED: [H3882] livyathan = from H3867 lavah (to twine/wreathe). "a wreathed animal, i.e. serpent (especially crocodile or large sea-monster); figuratively the constellation of the dragon; also AS A SYMBOL OF BABYLON." KJV: leviathan.
RELATED: [H5175] nachash = from H5172 (to hiss). "a snake." KJV: serpent.
RELATED: [G3789] ophis = probably from G3700 (to gaze/see). "a snake, figuratively an artful malicious person, especially Satan." KJV: serpent.
RELATED: [H7294] Rahab = "boaster" — an EPITHET OF EGYPT. Isa 51:9 "cut Rahab, wounded the dragon" — Rahab=Egypt=dragon.

NOTE: H8577 tanniyn is the SAME word for "serpent" in Exod 7:9-12 (Aaron's rod becomes tanniyn before Pharaoh; swallows the magicians' tanniyn). The word used in Pharaoh's court for the sign-contest is the SAME word used for Pharaoh himself in Ezek 29:3. Pharaoh IS the tanniyn; God's rod-become-tanniyn swallows him.

## Context Bag

**CREATION — THE GREAT TANNIYN:**
Gen 1:21 — God CREATED great H8577-tanniyn ("whales" KJV). FIRST use. The sea-monsters are creatures God made, not rival gods. Ps 148:7 "praise the LORD from the earth, ye H8577-dragons, and all deeps." Even the tanniyn are summoned to praise their Creator. Implication: the power behind empire is a CREATURE, not a co-equal deity.

**PHARAOH = THE DRAGON (EGYPT FACE):**
Exod 7:9-12 — Aaron's rod becomes H8577-tanniyn before Pharaoh. Magicians' rods also become H8577-tanniyn. Aaron's SWALLOWS theirs. co: EGYPT, SERPENT. The sign is enacted parable: God's agent out-dragons the dragon.
Ezek 29:3 — "Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great H8577-tanniyn that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is mine own, and I have made it for myself." co: EGYPT, SEA/RIVERS. Pharaoh = dragon IN the rivers/seas. Self-deifying: "I made it for myself." Dragon = empire-animating power that claims creation-authority.
Ezek 32:2 — "Pharaoh...thou art as a H8577-tanniyn in the seas: thou camest forth with thy rivers, troubledst the waters with thy feet, fouledst their rivers." co: EGYPT, SEA. Dragon fouls/troubles the waters (= nations, per Rev 17:15).
Isa 51:9 — "Art thou not it that hath cut H7294-Rahab, wounded the H8577-tanniyn?" Rahab = epithet of Egypt (H7294 = "boaster, an epithet of Egypt"). God wounded Egypt-as-dragon at the Exodus. Ps 89:10 "Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces." Ps 87:4 "I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon" — Egypt and Babylon named together.
Jer 51:34 — "Nebuchadrezzar...hath swallowed me up like a H8577-tanniyn." co: BABYLON. Now BABYLON's king takes the dragon-role. The tanniyn power transfers from Egypt to Babylon.

**DESOLATION MARKER — DRAGON'S HABITATION:**
Isa 13:22 — "dragons in their pleasant palaces" — context: BABYLON's fall. co: FALL_OF_BABYLON.
Isa 34:13 — "habitation of dragons" — context: EDOM's desolation.
Isa 35:7 — "habitation of dragons...shall be grass with reeds." Reversal: dragon-habitation restored.
Jer 9:11 — "Jerusalem heaps, den of dragons." Jer 10:22 — "cities of Judah...den of dragons."
Jer 49:33 — "Hazor...dwelling for dragons."
Jer 51:37 — "Babylon shall become heaps, dwellingplace for dragons." co: BABYLON, FALL_OF_BABYLON.
Mal 1:3 — "Esau's heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness."
PATTERN: "habitation/den/dwelling of dragons" = marker of divine desolation upon empires and covenant-breaking cities. Where the dragon dwells = where God has removed His presence. Applied to: Babylon, Edom, Hazor, Jerusalem, Judah.

**LEVIATHAN — THE DRAGON IN THE SEA:**
Job 41:1-34 — Leviathan H3882: untameable by man, only God confronts it. "king over all the children of pride" (41:34). co: SEA, PRIDE.
Ps 74:13-14 — "Thou brakest the heads of the H8577-dragons in the waters. Thou brakest the heads of H3882-leviathan in pieces." Dragon (plural heads!) + leviathan parallel. "Heads" = Rev 12:3 seven heads.
Isa 27:1 — "In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish H3882-leviathan the piercing H5175-serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the H8577-tanniyn that is in the SEA." THREE terms converge: leviathan = serpent (nachash) = dragon (tanniyn). ALL in the sea. "In that day" = eschatological. co: SWORD, SEA.
Job 7:12 — "Am I a sea, or a H8577-whale [tanniyn], that thou settest a watch over me?" Sea + tanniyn paired.

**NACHASH (SERPENT) → DRAGON CONNECTION:**
Gen 3:1-15 — H5175 nachash: deceived Eve, cursed, seed-enmity with woman's seed. Gen 3:15 = protoevangelium.
Rev 12:9 — "the great G1404-dragon was cast out, that old G3789-serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world." EXPLICIT IDENTIFICATION: dragon = ancient serpent = Devil = Satan = world-deceiver. "Old serpent" (archaios ophis) points back to Gen 3.
Rev 20:2 — "the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years." Same fourfold identification repeated.
2Cor 11:3 — "as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty." Paul links Eden serpent to present deception.
Isa 27:1 uses BOTH: nachash (H5175 serpent) + tanniyn (H8577 dragon) = same entity.
Exod 7:9-12 uses H8577 tanniyn (NOT H5175 nachash) for Aaron's rod. But Exod 4:3 uses H5175 nachash when Moses' rod becomes serpent before Israel. Different audiences: nachash for Israel (the enemy they know — Eden's deceiver), tanniyn for Pharaoh (the monster he claims to be).

**REVELATION — THE DRAGON SYSTEM:**
Rev 12:3 — "great red G1404-dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, seven crowns upon his heads." co: BEAST. SAME structure as beast (Rev 13:1: seven heads, ten horns, ten crowns). Dragon = the power behind the beast.
Rev 12:4 — "dragon stood before the woman ready to be delivered, for to devour her child." co: MAN_CHILD. Dragon vs. woman's seed = Gen 3:15 enacted in cosmic register.
Rev 12:7-9 — war in heaven, Michael fights dragon; dragon cast to earth. co: HEAVEN, CAST_INTO_SEA (parallel: cast from heaven to earth).
Rev 12:13-17 — dragon persecutes woman, casts flood from mouth (nations/water after her), earth swallows flood, dragon makes war with REMNANT of her seed "which keep the commandments of God." co: SEA, WINGS (eagle), DECEIVE.
Rev 13:2 — "the dragon gave him [the beast] his power, and his seat, and great authority." Dragon → beast = spiritual authority → political manifestation. Same pattern: Satan behind Pharaoh, behind Nebuchadnezzar, behind beast.
Rev 13:4 — "they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast." Dragon-worship through beast-worship. Idolatry's true object.
Rev 13:11 — second beast "had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon." co: LAMB. Mimicry: looks like lamb, speaks dragon. False prophet's voice = dragon's voice.
Rev 16:13 — "three unclean spirits...out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet." Unholy trinity: dragon (counterfeit Father), beast (counterfeit Son), false prophet (counterfeit Spirit). co: DECEIVE.
Rev 20:2-3 — dragon bound 1000 years, cast into bottomless pit, sealed, "that he should deceive the nations no more." co: PIT_ABYSS, DECEIVE, SEAL. Dragon's primary weapon = deception. Binding = deception neutralized.

**OT MISCELLANEOUS:**
Deut 32:33 — "Their wine is the poison of H8577-dragons, and cruel venom of asps." co: WINE. Israel's enemies' wine = dragon-venom. Wine of nations = poisonous.
Ps 44:19 — "sore broken us in the place of H8577-dragons." Exile = dragon's territory.
Ps 91:13 — "tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the H8577-dragon shalt thou trample." co: LION. Promise of dominion over the dragon.
Job 30:29 — "brother to H8577-dragons, companion to owls." Desolation/lament.
Isa 43:20 — "dragons and owls...honour me" in restored wilderness. Even dragons acknowledge God.
Neh 2:13 — "dragon well" in Jerusalem's ruins. Physical landmark in the desolation.
Mic 1:8 — "wailing like the dragons" — dragons/jackals as sound of mourning.
Lam 4:3 — "sea monsters H8577-tanniyn draw out the breast, give suck to their young." Here tanniyn = natural creature. Dual use: natural animal AND symbolic power.

PATTERN SUMMARY:
Dragon = the spiritual authority behind successive empires. ONE power, many faces:
- Eden: nachash (serpent) → Gen 3:1-15
- Egypt: Pharaoh = the tanniyn in the rivers → Ezek 29:3, Isa 51:9
- Babylon: Nebuchadnezzar swallows like tanniyn → Jer 51:34
- Eschatological: leviathan slain → Isa 27:1
- Revelation: dragon explicitly = old serpent = Devil = Satan → Rev 12:9, 20:2

MECHANISM: Dragon → Beast → False Prophet. Dragon gives power (Rev 13:2), beast exercises it, false prophet enforces worship. Dragon NEVER rules directly in Revelation — always through intermediary systems. This matches OT: tanniyn works through Pharaoh, through Nebuchadnezzar, through empires.

"HABITATION OF DRAGONS" = desolation marker. Where empire once stood, jackals/monsters now dwell. Applied to: Babylon (Isa 13:22, Jer 51:37), Edom (Isa 34:13), Hazor (Jer 49:33), Jerusalem (Jer 9:11), Judah (Jer 10:22). The dragon inhabits ruins because empire IS ruin.

DRAGON IN THE SEA: tanniyn consistently associated with sea/waters (Ezek 29:3, 32:2, Isa 27:1, Ps 74:13, Job 7:12). Sea = nations (Rev 17:15). Dragon in the sea = spiritual power operating through/within the chaos of nations. Beast rises FROM the sea (Rev 13:1) = empire emerges from nations, powered by dragon.

H5175 nachash (serpent) vs H8577 tanniyn (dragon): nachash = personal deceiver (Gen 3, individual temptation). tanniyn = empire-scale power (Pharaoh, cosmic adversary). Same entity, different operational scales. Rev 12:9 collapses both into one: "great dragon...that old serpent."

H3882 leviathan: Strong's explicitly notes "also as a symbol of Babylon." Multi-headed (Ps 74:14), sea-dwelling, king of the proud (Job 41:34). The dragon is the pride-animated chaos-power that God alone can subdue.
