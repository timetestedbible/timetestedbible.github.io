[H8577] tanniyn / tannim = intensive from H8565 tan (= monster, elongated creature). "a marine or land monster, i.e. sea-serpent or jackal." KJV: dragon, sea-monster, serpent, whale.
[H8565] tan = from unused root meaning "to elongate." "a monster (preternaturally formed), i.e. a sea-serpent or huge marine animal; also a jackal." KJV: dragon, whale.
[G1404] drakon = probably from alternate form of derkomai (to look/see). "a fabulous kind of serpent (perhaps as supposed to fascinate)." KJV: dragon.
RELATED: [H3882] livyathan = from H3867 lavah (to twine/wreathe). "a wreathed animal, i.e. serpent (especially crocodile or large sea-monster); figuratively the constellation of the dragon; also AS A SYMBOL OF BABYLON." KJV: leviathan.
RELATED: [H5175] nachash = from H5172 (to hiss). "a snake." KJV: serpent.
RELATED: [G3789] ophis = probably from G3700 (to gaze/see). "a snake, figuratively an artful malicious person, especially Satan." KJV: serpent.
RELATED: [H7294] Rahab = "boaster" — an EPITHET OF EGYPT. Isa 51:9 "cut Rahab, wounded the dragon" — Rahab=Egypt=dragon.

NOTE: H8577 tanniyn is the SAME word for "serpent" in Exod 7:9-12 (Aaron's rod becomes tanniyn before Pharaoh; swallows the magicians' tanniyn). The word used in Pharaoh's court for the sign-contest is the SAME word used for Pharaoh himself in Ezek 29:3. Pharaoh IS the tanniyn; God's rod-become-tanniyn swallows him.

## Context Bag

Gen 1:21 — subj: God CREATED great H8577-tanniyn. First use. Sea-monsters = creatures, not rival gods. Ps 148:7 — dragons summoned to praise Creator. Power behind empire is a CREATURE.
Exod 7:9-12 — subj: Aaron's rod→tanniyn; magicians' rods→tanniyn; Aaron's SWALLOWS theirs. co: EGYPT, SERPENT. God's agent out-dragons the dragon. NOTE: same H8577 used for Pharaoh (Ezek 29:3).
Ezek 29:3 — subj: Pharaoh = great tanniyn in rivers. "My river, I MADE it." co: EGYPT, SEA. Self-deifying. Dragon = empire-animating power claiming creation-authority.
Ezek 32:2 — subj: Pharaoh = tanniyn in seas, troubles/fouls waters. co: EGYPT, SEA.
Isa 51:9 — subj: God cut Rahab(H7294=epithet of Egypt), wounded tanniyn. Ps 89:10, 87:4 "Rahab and Babylon" paired.
Jer 51:34 — subj: Nebuchadnezzar swallowed like tanniyn. co: BABYLON. Dragon-role transfers Egypt→Babylon.
Isa 13:22, 34:13, Jer 9:11, 10:22, 49:33, 51:37, Mal 1:3 — "habitation/den of dragons" = DESOLATION MARKER. Applied to: Babylon, Edom, Hazor, Jerusalem, Judah. Where dragon dwells = God's presence removed. Isa 35:7 — reversal: dragon-habitation restored.
Job 41:1-34 — subj: Leviathan H3882. Untameable by man. "King over all children of pride." co: SEA, PRIDE.
Ps 74:13-14 — subj: broke HEADS (plural!) of tanniyn + leviathan in waters. "Heads" → Rev 12:3 seven heads.
Isa 27:1 — subj: LORD punishes leviathan + nachash(H5175) + tanniyn(H8577) in SEA. THREE terms converge = one entity. "In that day" = eschatological. co: SWORD, SEA.
Gen 3:1-15 — subj: H5175 nachash deceives, cursed, seed-enmity. Protoevangelium.
Rev 12:9 — subj: EXPLICIT ID: great dragon = old serpent = Devil = Satan = world-deceiver. Rev 20:2 repeats fourfold identification.
Exod 7:9 vs 4:3 — tanniyn(H8577) before Pharaoh; nachash(H5175) before Israel. Different audiences: nachash = personal deceiver; tanniyn = empire-scale power.
Rev 12:3-4 — subj: red dragon, 7 heads+10 horns+7 crowns = same structure as beast (Rev 13:1). Stood before woman to devour child = Gen 3:15 cosmic. co: BEAST, MAN_CHILD.
Rev 12:7-9 — subj: war in heaven, Michael casts dragon to earth. Rev 12:13-17 — persecutes woman, flood from mouth, war with remnant (commandments+testimony). co: DECEIVE, SEA.
Rev 13:2,4 — subj: dragon gave beast power+seat+authority. Dragon-worship through beast-worship. Spiritual→political manifestation.
Rev 13:11 — subj: second beast: horns like LAMB, speaks as dragon. co: LAMB. Mimicry.
Rev 16:13 — subj: unclean spirits from dragon+beast+false prophet. Unholy trinity. co: DECEIVE.
Rev 20:2-3 — subj: dragon bound 1000yr, cast into pit, sealed. co: PIT_ABYSS, DECEIVE, SEAL. Primary weapon = deception.
Deut 32:33 — subj: wine = poison of dragons. co: WINE. Ps 44:19 — broken in place of dragons = exile. Ps 91:13 — trample dragon = dominion promise. Lam 4:3 — tanniyn as natural creature (dual use).

**PATTERNS**: (1) ONE POWER, MANY FACES — Eden: nachash → Egypt: Pharaoh-tanniyn → Babylon: Nebuchadnezzar-tanniyn → Eschatological: leviathan slain → Rev: dragon=old serpent=Satan. (2) DRAGON→BEAST→FALSE PROPHET: dragon gives power (13:2), beast exercises, false prophet enforces. Never rules directly — always through intermediary. (3) "HABITATION OF DRAGONS" = desolation marker on empires. Empire IS ruin. (4) DRAGON IN THE SEA: tanniyn+sea consistent (Ezek 29:3, 32:2, Isa 27:1, Ps 74:13). Sea = nations. Beast rises FROM sea. (5) nachash = personal deceiver vs tanniyn = empire-scale. Rev 12:9 collapses both. (6) Leviathan: multi-headed, sea-dwelling, king of proud. Pride-animated chaos-power only God subdues.
