• 2Thess 2:2: spkr:Paul ctx:eschatological → "NOT soon G4531-shaken...NOR G2360-troubled" + day-of-Christ + man-of-sin [Preserves Olivet tradition]

• Jn 14:1,27: spkr:Jesus ctx:Upper Room → "Let NOT heart be G5015-troubled" + peace-giving ≠ world's peace
• 1Pet 3:14: "Be NOT G5399-afraid of THEIR G5401-terror, neither be G5015-troubled" [Fear belongs to oppressor]

**OT SOURCE TEMPLATES**:
• Jer 51:46 [Babylon oracle]: "heart H7401-faint + ye H3372-fear for H8052-rumour...ruler vs ruler" → God's people warned NOT to panic IN Babylon
• Jer 50:43 [Babylon oracle]: "King heard...hands H7503-feeble + H6869-anguish + H2427-pangs as woman H3205-travail" → Enemy DOES the panic
• 2Chr 15:5-7 [Azariah]: "God H2000-vexed all nations + H6869-adversity...let NOT hands be H7503-weak" → Template Jesus quotes
• Jer 30:5-7 [Jacob's trouble]: H2731-trembling + H6343-dread + H3420-paleness + birth-travail → Before deliverance

**RECYCLED FORMULA - Jer 6:24 → Jer 50:43**: 
VERBATIM Hebrew: "hands H7503-feeble + H6869-anguish + H2427-pangs + woman H3205-travail"
First applied to Zion under Babylon → Then to Babylon under nations → Pattern repeats

**COMPOUND FEAR-RESPONSE ELEMENTS**:
Physical: hands-feeble (H7503) || heart-melt (H4549) || face-paleness (H3420) || trembling (H2731) || heart-failing (G674)
Emotional: anguish (H6869) || dread (H6343) || alarm (H926/G2360) || terror (G4422)
Comparison: birth-pangs (H2427/H2256) || woman-travail (H3205)

**SORTING MECHANISM**: Same events → Opposite responses
Jer 50:43 vs 51:46: Babylon's king DOES fear-response || God's people warned NOT to
Matt 24:6 vs Lk 21:25-26: Disciples NOT troubled || Nations WILL experience distress/hearts-failing
1Pet 3:14: Don't fear THEIR terror → Terror belongs to enemy

**CROSS-LANGUAGE CHAIN**:
H7401+H3372 (Jer 51:46) → G2360 (Matt 24:6) [Jesus compresses two Hebrew words]
H7503 (hands-feeble) → G674 (hearts-failing) [Physical collapse transfers]
H926 (sudden-alarm) ≈ G2360 (clamor-fright) [Closest semantic match]
H3420 (paleness) → Lk 21:26 face-change implied

**ANOMALY**: Jn 14:1,27 uses G5015 (general agitation) not G2360 (specific eschatological panic) → Different trigger, same prohibition, same peace antidote || Jesus Himself was G5015-troubled (Jn 12:27,13:21) → He absorbed the response to spare disciples

**MEANING**: Do not respond with covenant-breaker's panic to covenant-judgment signs → Recognize known prophetic pattern → These are birth-pains preceding deliverance, not destruction

**PATTERN SUMMARY**: Wars/armies → Birth-pains → Fear-response → Earth-shaking || In ALL God's-people passages: fear-response PROHIBITED || Fear-response = diagnostic separating covenant-keeper from covenant-breaker in same event
