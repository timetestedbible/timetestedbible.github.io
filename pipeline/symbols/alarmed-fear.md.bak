## Context Bag

### STRONGS CORE

**G2360 θροέω (throéō)** — "to clamor; by impl. to frighten." KJV: "trouble." Derivation: from root "to wail." Only 3× NT: Matt 24:6, Mk 13:7, 2 Thess 2:2. RELATED WORDS from same root: G2351 θόρυβος (thorybos)=tumult/uproar; G2355 θρῆνος (thrēnos)=wailing/lamentation; G2358 θριαμβεύω (thriambeuō)=triumph (noisy procession). Semantic field: loud emotional outcry — the SOUND of alarm. Not quiet anxiety but public panic.

**G4422 πτοέω (ptoéō)** — "to scare." KJV: "frighten/terrify." Only 2× NT: Lk 21:9, Lk 24:37. Luke's Olivet parallel uses THIS instead of G2360 — synonymous in context. Derivation: causing to fall/fly away. Conveys being STARTLED into flight.

**G5015 ταράσσω (tarassō)** — "to stir/agitate (roil water)." Used in Jn 14:1,27; 1 Pet 3:14; also Jn 12:27, 13:21 (Jesus's own soul troubled). BROADER word than G2360 — general disturbance. In Jn 14:1+27 Jesus prohibits SAME response: "let not your heart be troubled." Same discourse context as Olivet (final week instructions).

**G4531 σαλεύω (saleuō)** — "to waver, shake, agitate." 2 Thess 2:2 "not soon SHAKEN in mind" paired with G2360 "nor troubled." Also Lk 21:26 "powers of heaven shall be SHAKEN." Physical tremor + psychological destabilization.

**G674 ἀποψύχω (apopsychō)** — "to breathe out, faint." Only 1× NT: Lk 21:26 "men's hearts FAILING them for fear." Luke EXPANDS what Matt/Mk compress into G2360 — the full physiological response.

**G5401 φόβος (phobos)** — "alarm, fright." Lk 21:26 "hearts failing for FEAR." The object that causes G674 fainting.

**G181 ἀκαταστασία (akatastasia)** — "instability, disorder." Lk 21:9 "wars and COMMOTIONS." Luke substitutes this for Matt/Mk's "rumors of wars" — the same instability, different angle.

### HEBREW FEAR-RESPONSE CLUSTER (OT SOURCE VOCABULARY)

**Jer 51:46** (Babylon oracle — source text for Matt 24:6):
- H7401 רָכַךְ (rākak) — "to soften" = heart FAINT. Figurative: courage dissolving.

- Pattern: heart-faint + fear + rumour + violence + ruler-against-ruler.

**Jer 50:43** (Babylon oracle — king of Babylon's response):
- H7503 רָפָה (rāphāh) — "to slacken" = hands waxed FEEBLE. Physical collapse of capacity to act.

- H3420 יֵרָקוֹן (yērāqôn) — "paleness (from fright)" = faces turned to PALENESS. From H3418 (yereq=green). Also "mildew" in plants (Deut 28:22, Hag 2:17) — covenant-curse vocabulary.
- H6869 צָרָה (tsārāh) — Jacob's TROUBLE.
- H3205 יָלַד (yālad) — men's hands on loins as woman in TRAVAIL.
- Pattern: trembling + dread + paleness + birth-pangs + anguish.

**Jer 6:22-24** (army from north against Zion — TEMPLATE for Jer 50:41-43):
- H7503 (rāphāh) — hands wax FEEBLE. IDENTICAL WORD as Jer 50:43.
- H6869 (tsārāh) — ANGUISH. IDENTICAL as Jer 50:43.
- H2427 (chîyl) — PANGS. IDENTICAL as Jer 50:43.
- H3205 (yālad) — woman in TRAVAIL. IDENTICAL as Jer 50:43.
- KEY: Jer 6:24 and 50:43 are VERBATIM PARALLELS — same words, same order. Jeremiah RECYCLED the Zion-judgment vocabulary and applied it to Babylon. What happened TO Zion now happens to Babylon's king.

**Isa 13:7-8** (Oracle against Babylon — Day of the LORD):
- H7503 (rāphāh) — all hands FAINT.
- H4549 מָסַס (māsas) — every heart shall MELT. Literally "to liquefy."
- H926 בָּהַל (bāhal) — they shall be AFRAID/ALARMED. "To tremble inwardly, be suddenly alarmed." ← CLOSEST Hebrew semantic match to G2360 throéō.
- H2256 חֵבֶל (chēbel) — SORROWS/birth-pains. Same word as Matt 24:8 ōdinōn via LXX.
- H2342 חוּל (chûwl) — in PAIN/writhing. Root of H2427.
- H8539 תָּמַהּ (tāmah) — AMAZED one at another. Stunned disbelief.
- H3851 לַהַב (lahab) — faces as FLAMES. Physical transformation from fear.

**2 Chr 15:5-7** (Azariah's oracle — DEFINING template for Matt 24:6-7):
- H2000 הָמַם (hāmam) — God did VEX them. "To put in commotion, disturb, destroy."
- H6869 (tsārāh) — all ADVERSITY/trouble.
- H7503 (rāphāh) — "let NOT your hands be WEAK" (v7). PROHIBITION — same word as Babylon's hands-feeble.

**Dan 11:44** — "tidings (H8052 shemū'āh = SAME as Jer 51:46 'rumour') shall TROUBLE (H926 bāhal = SAME as Isa 13:8 'afraid') him." Reports + alarm in eschatological context.

### LXX CROSS-LANGUAGE EVIDENCE

LXX Jer 27:43 (= MT 50:43): "hands were ENFEEBLED: anguish overcame him, pangs as of a woman in travail." Greek: ἐξελύθησαν (enfeebled/loosened) for H7503.

LXX Jer 37:5-6 (= MT 30:5-6): "Ye shall hear a sound of FEAR, there is fear, and there is not peace...hands are on his loins; their faces are turned to PALENESS." Greek preserves fear+paleness compound.

LXX Jer 6:24: "our hands are WEAKENED: anguish has seized us, the pangs as of a woman in travail."

LXX Isa 13:7-8: "every hand shall become POWERLESS, and every soul of man shall be DISMAYED...pangs shall seize them, as of a woman in travail...shall be amazed, and shall change their COUNTENANCE as a flame."

LXX Ps 47:6-7 (= MT 48:5-6): "They were TROUBLED, they were MOVED. TREMBLING took hold on them: pangs as of a woman in travail."

LXX Ezek 21:12: "every heart shall BREAK, and all hands shall become FEEBLE, and all flesh and every spirit shall FAINT."

The LXX demonstrates the SAME compound pattern in Greek: hands-loosened + heart-dismayed + birth-pangs + face-change.

### OCCURRENCE TABLE (compressed)

**Matt 24:6** — SUBJ: Olivet Discourse. SPEAKER: Jesus. "See that ye be NOT G2360-troubled." CO-OCC: wars+rumors(G4171+G189), birth-pains(v8), earthquake(v7), nation-against-nation(v7), famine(v7), the-end(v6). ROLE: PROHIBITION directed at disciples. CYCLE: Rome/eschatological. CONTEXT: Jer 51:46 vocabulary quoted.

**Mark 13:7** — SUBJ: Olivet parallel. SPEAKER: Jesus. "Be ye NOT G2360-troubled." IDENTICAL co-occurrences to Matt 24:6.

**2 Thess 2:2** — SUBJ: Paul's eschatological instruction. "NOT soon G4531-shaken...NOR G2360-troubled." CO-OCC: day-of-Christ, gathering(v1), falling-away(v3), man-of-sin(v3). CONTEXT: Paul PRESERVES the Olivet vocabulary — throéō links this directly to Jesus's teaching. Paul heard this word from the tradition. CYCLE: eschatological.

**Luke 21:9** — SUBJ: Olivet parallel. SPEAKER: Jesus. "Be NOT G4422-terrified." Luke substitutes ptoéō for throéō but SAME prohibition. CO-OCC: wars, commotions(G181), the-end. CYCLE: Rome/eschatological.

**Luke 21:25-26** — SUBJ: Olivet expansion. SPEAKER: Jesus. "Distress(G4928) of nations with perplexity(G640)...hearts failing(G674) for fear(G5401)...powers shaken(G4531)." This is the EXPANDED form of what G2360 compresses — Luke provides the FULL physiological fear-response that matches the OT Hebrew cluster.

**John 14:1** — SUBJ: Upper Room discourse. SPEAKER: Jesus. "Let NOT your heart be G5015-troubled." Same week as Olivet Discourse. CO-OCC: belief, Father's house, coming again. ROLE: PROHIBITION — same posture as Matt 24:6.

**John 14:27** — SUBJ: Upper Room. SPEAKER: Jesus. "Let NOT your heart be G5015-troubled, neither let it be G1168-afraid." PAIRS troubled+afraid. CO-OCC: PEACE (shalom — "my peace I give"). Explicit OPPOSITE stated.

**1 Pet 3:14** — SUBJ: Suffering exhortation. "Be NOT G5399-afraid of their terror(G5401), neither be G5015-troubled." PAIRS fear+troubled — SAME pair as Jn 14:27. CO-OCC: suffering, righteousness. SOURCE: Peter quoting Isa 8:12-13 LXX. The FEAR belongs to the oppressor; don't internalize it.

**Jer 51:46** — SUBJ: Babylon oracle. "Lest your heart H7401-faint, and ye H3372-fear for the H8052-rumour...rumour shall come...violence...ruler against ruler." CO-OCC: wars/rumors, ruler-vs-ruler(=nation-against-nation template). ROLE: WARNING to God's people IN Babylon — don't catch the panic. CYCLE: Exile.

**Jer 50:43** — SUBJ: Babylon oracle. "King of Babylon...hands H7503-feeble: H6869-anguish...H2427-pangs as woman in H3205-travail." CO-OCC: army-from-north(v41), nation+kings(v41), birth-pangs. ROLE: The fear-response REALIZED on the enemy. What God's people are told NOT to do (51:46), Babylon's king DOES. CYCLE: Exile.

**Jer 30:5-7** — SUBJ: Jacob's Trouble. "H2731-trembling, H6343-fear, not peace...hands on loins as woman in H3205-travail...faces H3420-paleness...H6869 Jacob's trouble." CO-OCC: birth-pangs, anguish, paleness. ROLE: Description of judgment-era BEFORE deliverance ("he shall be saved out of it" v7). CYCLE: Exile→Return.

**Jer 6:24** — SUBJ: Army from north. "Hands H7503-feeble: H6869-anguish...H2427-pangs as woman in H3205-travail." VERBATIM parallel to Jer 50:43. Jeremiah recycled this formula. First applied to Zion, then to Babylon. CYCLE: Babylon siege.

**Jer 49:24** — SUBJ: Damascus oracle. "H7503-feeble...H7374-fear seized...H6869-anguish and H2256-sorrows...as woman in H3205-travail." Same formula applied to Damascus. CYCLE: Kingdom.

**Isa 13:7-8** — SUBJ: Oracle against Babylon, Day of LORD. "Hands H7503-faint, heart H4549-melt, H926-alarmed, H2256+H2342-pangs/writhing as woman in H3205-travail, H8539-amazed, faces H3851-flames." FULLEST Hebrew expression of the compound fear-response. CYCLE: Babylon/eschatological.

**Isa 21:3-4** — SUBJ: Burden of the desert of the sea (Babylon). "Loins filled with pain, H6735-pangs as H3205-travailing woman, H926-dismayed, heart H8582-panted, H6427-fearfulness, H2731-fear." CYCLE: Babylon.

**Ps 48:5-6** — SUBJ: Kings assembled against Zion. "Troubled, hasted away. Fear took hold...pain as woman in travail." POETIC compression of full cluster. CYCLE: Zion theology.

**2 Chr 15:5-7** — SUBJ: Azariah's oracle during Asa's reform. "No peace...great H4103-vexations...nation destroyed nation...God H2000-vexed them with all H6869-adversity. Let NOT your hands be H7503-weak." TEMPLATE Jesus quotes. God is AGENT of vexation. V7 PROHIBITS the fear-response using same H7503 Babylon shows in Jer 50:43.

**Ezek 7:17,27** — SUBJ: End come upon Israel. "All hands H7503...defiled" (v17). "Hands of people H926-troubled" (v27). CO-OCC: H8052-rumour upon rumour (v26). Same cluster.

**Ezek 21:12** — SUBJ: Sword of the LORD. "Every heart shall break, all hands feeble, all flesh faint." Full body-collapse.

**Prov 3:25-26** — SUBJ: Wisdom exhortation. "Be NOT H3372-afraid of sudden H6343-fear (pachad)...the LORD shall be thy confidence." WISDOM application of same prohibition. OPPOSITE: LORD as confidence.

**Deut 20:1** — SUBJ: Laws of warfare. "Be NOT afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee." FOUNDATIONAL prohibition — Israel never to fear armies because God is present. CYCLE: Exodus/wilderness.

### SEVEN CANDIDATE MEANINGS — EVALUATED

**1. Dictionary synonym: "Don't be disturbed/alarmed."** Generic emotional advice. Fails: doesn't explain why G2360 (a wailing-clamor word) vs. G5399 (standard fear) or G5015 (agitation). REJECT — too thin.

**2. Emotional composure: "Stay calm."** Self-help reading. Fails: ignores prophetic context entirely. The command appears ONLY in eschatological/judgment passages. Calm is a RESULT, not the meaning. REJECT.

**3. Timing discernment: "Don't assume the end has come."** Fits Matt 24:6 ("end not yet"), 2 Thess 2:2 ("day not at hand"), Lk 21:9 ("end not by and by"). Strong contextual fit. But: this is the CONTEXTUAL application, not the word's semantic force. The word means alarmed-clamor, not temporal-misreading. PARTIAL — application not core.

**4. Covenant recognition: "Know these are covenant judgments, not chaos."** Connects to dei genesthai (v6 "must come to pass" = covenantal necessity). Birth-pains are covenant mechanism. Panic comes from seeing chaos; recognition comes from seeing pattern. STRONG — but misses the body-response dimension.

**5. Babylon's fear belongs to Babylon: "Don't respond like the covenant-breaker."** The SAME fear-response vocabulary (hands-feeble, heart-faint, anguish, travail-pangs) is APPLIED to Babylon/enemies in Jer 50:43, Isa 13:7-8, Jer 49:24 but PROHIBITED for God's people in Matt 24:6, 2 Chr 15:7, Jer 51:46. Substitution test: "See that you don't respond like Babylon's king did" — works in ALL three G2360 contexts. STRONGEST.

**6. Action-prohibition: "Don't be panicked into premature action."** Fits: Matt 24:6 → don't flee yet (actual sign is v15 abomination). 2 Thess 2:2 → don't be destabilized by false reports. Links to false-messiah deception (v4-5). STRONG complement to #5.

**7. Pattern recognition: "You've seen this before — it's the known prophetic sequence."** Jesus quotes Jer 51:46 + 2 Chr 15:6 — His audience should RECOGNIZE the pattern. Paul tells Thessalonians to remember what he taught them (2 Thess 2:5). The throéō is what happens when you DON'T recognize the pattern. STRONG complement.

### SUBSTITUTION TEST — Candidate #5 (primary) + #4, #6, #7 (supporting)

MEANING: **"Do not respond with the covenant-breaker's panic to covenant-judgment signs — recognize the known prophetic pattern; these are birth-pains preceding deliverance, not your destruction."**

- Matt 24:6 ✓ — "Hear wars/rumors — don't respond as Babylon's king did to the same reports (Jer 50:43). The end is not yet; these are birth-pains." Works.
- Mk 13:7 ✓ — Identical application. Works.
- 2 Thess 2:2 ✓ — "Don't be shaken into Babylonian panic by claims the day has come. Remember: man of sin first, gathering first (v1,3). Recognize the sequence." Works.
- Lk 21:9 ✓ — "Don't be startled-into-flight (G4422). These must first happen." Works.
- Lk 21:25-26 ✓ — The EXPANDED fear-response (distress, perplexity, hearts failing, shaken) = the Babylonian panic the nations WILL experience. God's people are told (v28) to "look up...your redemption draws near." OPPOSITE posture. Works.
- Jn 14:1,27 ✓ — "Don't let your heart respond with the world's agitation. My peace (not-world's-peace) I give." Works.
- 1 Pet 3:14 ✓ — "Don't be afraid of THEIR terror (G5401 = the fear that belongs to the oppressor), nor be troubled." Explicitly: the fear is THEIRS, don't internalize it. Works.
- Jer 51:46 ✓ — "Lest you catch the panic that's coming on Babylon — rumours will fly, violence will spike, rulers will war — but YOU go out (v45)." Works.
- 2 Chr 15:7 ✓ — "Don't let your hands go feeble (H7503) like the nations God is judging (v6) — there IS reward for your work." PROHIBITION uses enemy's symptom-word. Works.
- Prov 3:25-26 ✓ — "Don't fear the sudden alarm (H6343 pachad) of wicked's desolation — the LORD is your confidence." Works.

**FAILS in:** No verse tested. All passages sustain the reading. The dual structure — fear BELONGS to the enemy / prohibited for God's people — holds across every context from Deuteronomy to 1 Peter.

### THE COMPOUND PATTERN — CONFIRMED

Every passage where BIRTH_PAINS + WARS appear together features a MULTI-PART fear-response:

| Passage | Wars/Armies | Birth-pangs | Fear-response elements | Earth-shake |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Isa 13:6-9 | Day of LORD destruction | woman in travail (v8) | hands faint + hearts melt + alarmed + amazed + faces flames (v7-8) | land desolate (v9) |
| Jer 6:22-24 | army from north (v22) | woman in travail (v24) | hands feeble + anguish (v24) | — |
| Jer 30:5-7 | (implied: Jacob's trouble context) | woman in travail (v6) | trembling + dread + paleness + anguish (v5-7) | — |
| Jer 50:41-46 | army from north (v41) | woman in travail (v43) | hands feeble + anguish (v43); earth shakes (v46) | earth moved (v46) |
| Jer 51:45-49 | violence + ruler vs ruler (v46) | (50:43 immediately precedes) | heart faint + fear + rumours (v46) | heaven+earth respond (v48) |
| Ps 48:4-7 | kings assembled (v4) | woman in travail (v6) | troubled + hasted away + fear (v5-6) | ships broken (v7) |
| Matt 24:6-8 | wars + rumors (v6) | beginning of sorrows (v8) | do NOT be G2360-troubled (v6) | earthquakes (v7) |
| Mk 13:7-8 | wars + rumors (v7) | beginning of sorrows (v8) | do NOT be G2360-troubled (v7) | earthquakes (v8) |
| Lk 21:9-11,25-26 | wars + commotions (v9) | (see vv25-26 expansion) | do NOT be G4422-terrified (v9); hearts failing + fear (v26) | earthquakes (v11); powers shaken (v26) |
| 2 Thess 2:2 + 1 Thess 5:3 | (man of sin context) | travail on pregnant woman (5:3) | NOT shaken NOR G2360-troubled (2:2) | — |

The pattern is: **Wars/armies → Birth-pangs → Fear-response → Earth-shaking**. And in EVERY passage addressed to God's people, the fear-response is PROHIBITED. The fear-response is the DIAGNOSTIC that separates the covenant-keeper from the covenant-breaker in the same event.

### CROSS-TESTAMENT VOCABULARY CHAIN

HEBREW SOURCE → LXX BRIDGE → NT APPLICATION:
- H7401 (rākak, heart-faint) + H3372 (yārē', fear) in Jer 51:46 → G2360 (throéō) in Matt 24:6. Jesus COMPRESSES two Hebrew fear-words into one Greek prohibition.
- H7503 (rāphāh, hands-feeble) in Jer 50:43, 6:24, Isa 13:7 → LXX ἐξελύθησαν/weakened → G674 (apopsychō, hearts failing) in Lk 21:26. Physical collapse vocabulary translates across languages.
- H926 (bāhal, suddenly alarmed) in Isa 13:8, 21:3 → closest Hebrew semantic parallel to G2360. Both = sudden internal alarm with external vocalization.
- H3420 (yērāqôn, paleness) in Jer 30:6 → LXX "paleness" → Lk 21:26 "men's hearts failing" (face-change implied). The physical manifestation unique to Hebrew visible in LXX.
- H6343 (pachad, sudden alarm/dread) in Jer 30:5, Prov 3:25 → G5401 (phobos, alarm/fright) in Lk 21:26, 1 Pet 3:14.
- H6869 (tsārāh, anguish) in Jer 50:43, 6:24, 30:7 → G4928 (synochē, anguish/distress) in Lk 21:25.

The NT Olivet accounts DISTRIBUTE the OT compound across three synoptic versions: Matthew/Mark compress into G2360 (prohibition). Luke EXPANDS into the full body-response (G4422 + G674 + G5401 + G4928 + G640 + G4531). Paul PRESERVES G2360 exactly in 2 Thess 2:2, proving the word belongs to the Olivet tradition.

### CRITICAL STRUCTURAL INSIGHT

The fear-response prohibition functions as a **SORTING MECHANISM** in prophetic judgment contexts:

1. **Jer 50:43 vs. 51:46**: Babylon's king DOES the fear-response (hands-feeble, anguish, pangs). God's people are warned NOT to do it. Same event, opposite responses.
2. **Matt 24:6 vs. Lk 21:26**: Disciples told NOT to be troubled (v6). Nations WILL experience distress, perplexity, hearts failing (Lk 21:25-26). Same event, opposite responses.
3. **1 Thess 5:3-4**: Sudden destruction on THEM (the "peace and safety" crowd) as labor on a pregnant woman. But YOU are not in darkness that the day should overtake you. Same event, opposite responses.
4. **1 Pet 3:14**: Don't be afraid of THEIR terror. The terror is the enemy's property.

Pattern: **In every covenant-judgment event, the same signs produce PANIC in the covenant-breaker and RECOGNITION in the covenant-keeper.** The "do not be troubled" command is not comfort — it's a DIAGNOSTIC INSTRUCTION: if these signs make you panic, you're responding as Babylon responds. If they make you look up (Lk 21:28), you're responding as God's people should.

### RECYCLED FORMULA: JER 6:24 → JER 50:43

Jeremiah uses IDENTICAL Hebrew vocabulary for Zion's response to the army from the north (6:24) and Babylon's king's response to the army from the north (50:43):

Jer 6:24: "We heard...hands H7503-feeble...H6869-anguish...H2427-pangs...H3205-woman-travail"
Jer 50:43: "He heard...hands H7503-feeble...H6869-anguish...H2427-pangs...H3205-woman-travail"

VERBATIM. What happened to Zion under Babylon now happens to Babylon under the nations. The judgment boomerangs. Jesus, quoting this vocabulary, implies: and it will happen AGAIN — to Jerusalem under Rome, to Babylon-the-Great at the end. But God's people, in every iteration: do NOT be throéō.

### ANOMALIES

**John 14:1,27 (tarassō not throéō)**: Jesus uses the BROADER word (G5015) in the Upper Room, not the Olivet-specific G2360. This suggests tarassō is the GENUS (general disturbance) while throéō is the SPECIES (eschatological panic-alarm specifically). The Upper Room context concerns personal fear of Jesus's departure; the Olivet context concerns societal judgment-signs. Different trigger, same prohibition, same peace as antidote.

**Jesus Himself was tarassō (Jn 11:33, 12:27, 13:21)**: He experienced the troubled-soul that He tells disciples NOT to experience. He bore the agitation SO THAT they wouldn't have to. This inversion matters: the fear-response is real and legitimate — it's the CORRECT response to judgment. Jesus doesn't deny its reality; He absorbs it and then commands His people not to carry it.

**H3420 yērāqôn double-meaning**: "paleness from fright" (Jer 30:6) AND "mildew/blight" (Deut 28:22, Amos 4:9, Hag 2:17). Both are COVENANT CURSE vocabulary. The same word describes the face of the terrified man AND the blighted crop. Internal fear-response and external agricultural judgment share a term — fear IS a kind of blight on the human frame.

### QUEUE ADDITIONS

- **Jer 51:45-64 context integration** — needs update to incorporate fear-vocabulary analysis
- **1 Thess 4:13-5:11 context** — needs integration of throéō→ōdin chain (fear-response + birth-pains + sudden-destruction as unified complex)
- **2 Thess 2:1-12 context** — needs full study (throéō + man-of-sin + gathering + restrainer)
- **PEACE (shalom/eirēnē) symbol study** — the OPPOSITE of this symbol; appears in Jer 30:5 "not of peace," 1 Thess 5:3 "peace and safety," Jn 14:27 "my peace I give"
- **SLEEP symbol update** — 1 Thess 5:6-7 sleep-as-unawareness connects to fear-response: the sleeping don't panic because they're oblivious, the watching don't panic because they recognize the pattern — BOTH fail to panic but for opposite reasons
- **Mat 24:4-8 context update** — add ALARMED_FEAR as explicit symbol (currently noted as "new discovery" G2360, needs promotion)
