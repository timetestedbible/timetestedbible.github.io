## Context Bag

H8242 saq = coarse mesh from H8264 shaqaq "rush through." Dual sense: (1) grain sack (Gen 42:25,27,35; Josh 9:4; Lev 11:32), (2) mourning garment of dark goat-hair. G4526 sakkos = Hebrew loanword. Rev 6:12 specifies: G3189 melas "BLACK" + G5155 trichinos "of HAIR." Material inherently dark, coarse, replaces glory.

**A. MOURNING**: Gen 37:34 — Jacob, first use. co: PIT. 2Sam 3:31 — funeral. 2Sam 21:10 — spread over dead. Joel 1:8 — lament. co: FAMINE.
**B. REPENTANCE**: Jonah 3:5-8 — Nineveh: greatest to least + beasts. co: FASTING, ASHES. Judgment averted. 1Ki 21:27 — Ahab on flesh, delayed. Dan 9:3, Neh 9:1 — corporate. Matt 11:21/Lk 10:13 — Tyre+Sidon hypothetical.
**C. JUDGMENT ORACLES**: Jer 4:8, 6:26 — "gird sackcloth." co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. Amos 8:10 — GOD IMPOSES sackcloth. co: BALDNESS, SUN_DARK (v9). CRITICAL: v9 sun dark → v10 sackcloth → v11 famine of word. DARKENING PRODUCES SACKCLOTH. Isa 3:24 — beauty → sackcloth. Ezek 7:18, 27:31, Lam 2:10, Isa 15:3, 22:12, Jer 48:37/49:3.
**D. PETITION**: 1Ki 20:31-32 — submission garment. Est 4:1-4 — forbidden at king's gate. 2Ki 19:1-2 — Hezekiah before Assyrian threat. 1Chr 21:16 — before angel with sword.
**E. COVERING HEAVENS** (CRITICAL): Isa 50:3 — "I clothe HEAVENS with BLACKNESS, SACKCLOTH their COVERING." God clothes sky. Same vocabulary as people → applied to heavens. co: DARKNESS. Rev 6:12 — "sun BLACK as sackcloth of HAIR." Sun WEARS sackcloth. co: EARTHQUAKE, BLOOD (moon), STARS_FALL.
**F. PROPHETIC TESTIMONY**: Rev 11:3 — witnesses prophesy 1,260 days clothed in sackcloth. co: FIRE, OLIVE TREES, LAMPSTANDS. Not mourning — prophesying. Sackcloth = message IS judgment. Isa 20:2 — Isaiah wore sackcloth prophetically.
**G. REMOVED**: Ps 30:11 — sackcloth → gladness. Judgment-garment → joy-garment.

**PATTERNS**: (1) UNIFIED MEANING: visible testimony of judgment. PEOPLE wear it = glory departed. SUN wears it = authority darkened. WITNESSES wear it = message IS judgment. (2) SMOKE=SACKCLOTH MECHANISM: Rev 9:2 smoke darkens sun (cause) → Rev 6:12 sun black as sackcloth (appearance) → Isa 50:3 heavens clothed. Chain: FIRE→SMOKE→SACKCLOTH(darkened sun)→DARKNESS. (3) AMOS 8:9-12 SEQUENCE: sun dark at noon → sackcloth on loins → famine of word → seek not find. Sun wearing sackcloth = word withdrawn. Rev 11:7 witnesses killed = Amos 8:11. (4) REV 11:3+6:12 CONVERGENCE: witnesses wear sackcloth 1,260 days = same period sun wears sackcloth. Testimony ends → famine begins. (5) CO-OCCURRING CLUSTERS: +ASHES 8×, +BALDNESS 6×, +FASTING 5×, +REND_CLOTHES 5×. Progressive self-abasement sequence: rend→sackcloth→ashes→fast→prostrate. (6) PRODUCTION: goat/camel hair → woven dark mesh. Darkness inherent, not dyed.

**CANDIDATES**: #5 "dark covering replacing glory" + #6 "testimony of loss" combined = BEST FIT: **Visible testimony of judgment — dark covering replacing glory.** Passes all 51 occurrences.
