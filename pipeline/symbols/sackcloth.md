## Context Bag

**[H8242] saq** (noun) = mesh, coarse loose cloth, sacking. From [H8264] shaqaq = "to course, run, rush" — root describes porous mesh that lets liquid rush through. Dual BDB senses: (1) sack/bag for grain (Gen 42:25,27,35; Josh 9:4; Lev 11:32), (2) mourning garment of coarse dark hair (all other 42+ OT uses). Same material, two functions: CONTAINING (grain) and COVERING (body). **[G4526] sakkos** = direct Hebrew loanword, 4× NT. **[G5155] trichinos** = "hairy, made of hair (mohair)" — only Rev 6:12, specifying the MATERIAL. **[G3189] melas** = "black" — Rev 6:12 "sun became BLACK as sackcloth of HAIR." The material IS inherently dark/black. Goat-hair fabric: rough, dark, uncomfortable, the OPPOSITE of fine linen or royal robes.

**PHYSICAL PROPERTIES → SYMBOLIC FUNCTION**: Dark color → replaces brightness. Coarse texture → replaces comfort. Porous mesh → allows passage through (root H8264). Worn against bare flesh (1Ki 21:27, 2Ki 6:30) or on loins (Gen 37:34, Amos 8:10) → intimate contact with judgment. REPLACES normal/glorious garments → the visible declaration that glory has departed.

**A. MOURNING OVER LOSS** (personal grief):
Gen 37:34 — Jacob on loins, mourning Joseph who was cast into PIT. First occurrence. CO: PIT (Joseph). Pattern: loved one lost → sackcloth.

**E. COVERING THE HEAVENS** (celestial sackcloth — CRITICAL):

Rev 6:12 — "sun became BLACK[G3189] as SACKCLOTH[G4526] of HAIR[G5155]." Sun WEARS sackcloth. CO: EARTHQUAKE, BLOOD (moon), STARS_FALL. The sun's glory replaced with dark, coarse covering.

**F. PROPHETIC TESTIMONY UNDER JUDGMENT**:
Rev 11:3 — Two witnesses prophesy 1,260 days "clothed in[G4016] sackcloth[G4526]." They WEAR sackcloth for the DURATION of their testimony. CO: FIRE (from mouth), OLIVE TREES, LAMPSTANDS. Not mourning for themselves — prophesying. Sackcloth = their MESSAGE IS JUDGMENT. They testify during the period when the sun is also wearing sackcloth.
Isa 20:2 — God commands Isaiah: "loose the sackcloth from off thy loins." Isaiah had been wearing sackcloth prophetically. Then walks naked = exposure.

**G. SACKCLOTH REMOVED = RESTORATION**:
Ps 30:11 — "Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing; put off my sackcloth, girded me with gladness." Sackcloth → gladness. Judgment-garment → joy-garment. CO: DANCING, GLADNESS. The reversal.

**H. SACK AS CONTAINER** (secondary sense — same root):
Gen 42:25,27,35 — Joseph's brothers' grain sacks. Josh 9:4 — Gibeonites' old sacks on asses (deception). Lev 11:32 — sack among vessels that become unclean. Same material: coarse mesh for holding grain OR wearing.

**PATTERN SUMMARY**:

**THE UNIFIED MEANING**: Sackcloth = visible testimony of judgment/loss. When PEOPLE wear it: their appearance declares "glory has departed, judgment has come." When the SUN wears it: the authority structure's brightness is replaced with darkness. When WITNESSES wear it: their prophetic message IS judgment. Same word, same function — the dark covering that replaces glory.

**THE SMOKE=SACKCLOTH MECHANISM**: Rev 9:2 smoke from abyss darkens sun (mechanism). Rev 6:12 sun black as sackcloth (appearance). Isa 50:3 heavens clothed with blackness = sackcloth their covering. Sackcloth IS what smoke LOOKS LIKE from below — the dark covering over the sky. Chain: FIRE(Babylon burns) → SMOKE(rises) → SACKCLOTH(appearance of darkened sun) → DARKNESS(authority obscured). Smoke is the cause; sackcloth describes the result.

**AMOS 8:9-12 SEQUENCE**: (1) sun goes down at noon (v9) → (2) sackcloth upon all loins (v10) → (3) famine of the word (v11) → (4) seek but not find (v12). Darkening → mourning → word withdrawn → desperate seeking. The sun wearing sackcloth = the word being withdrawn = prophetic famine. Rev 11:7 witnesses killed = word withdrawn = Amos 8:11 fulfillment.

**REV 11:3 + REV 6:12 CONVERGENCE**: Witnesses wear sackcloth 1,260 days = same period when sun wears sackcloth. They prophesy INSIDE the smoke that covers the sun. Their sackcloth = the era's sackcloth. When the witnesses finish testimony + beast kills them (Rev 11:7) = sackcloth period ends = Amos 8:11 famine begins.

**CO-OCCURRING CLUSTERS**: Sackcloth+ASHES (8×: Gen 37:34→dust, Dan 9:3, Est 4:1,3, Isa 58:5, Matt 11:21, Lk 10:13, Jonah 3:6). Sackcloth+BALDNESS (6×: Isa 3:24, 15:3, 22:12, Jer 48:37, Ezek 7:18, Amos 8:10). Sackcloth+FASTING (5×: Neh 9:1, Est 4:3, Dan 9:3, Joel 1:13, Ps 35:13). Sackcloth+REND_CLOTHES (5×: Gen 37:34, 1Ki 21:27, 2Ki 19:1, Est 4:1, 2Ki 6:30). The constellation: rend clothes → put on sackcloth → add ashes/dust → fast → lie on ground. Progressive self-abasement.

**PRODUCTION CHAIN**: Animal (goat/camel) → hair cut → woven into coarse dark mesh → worn as garment over bare flesh. The material comes from ANIMALS (living creatures) → processed into covering. Dark by nature, not dyed. The darkness is inherent in the material, not applied.

**7 CANDIDATE MEANINGS TESTED**:
1. "Mourning display" — fails Rev 6:12 (sun isn't mourning), Rev 11:3 (witnesses aren't mourning, they're prophesying)
2. "Repentance" — fails Amos 8:10 (God imposes it), Isa 50:3 (heavens don't repent), Rev 6:12
3. "Humiliation garment" — fails Isa 50:3, Rev 6:12, Rev 11:3
4. "Judgment acknowledgment" — close but too limited; doesn't capture the COVERING/DARKENING function
5. "Dark covering replacing glory" — works in ALL contexts: people's beauty→darkness, sun's brightness→darkness, witnesses covered in era of judgment
6. "Testimony of loss" — works: people SHOW grief, heavens SHOW judgment, witnesses DECLARE judgment
7. "Prophetic mourning garment" — fails Gen 42 sack usage, too narrow
8. "Covenant violation visible" — close but doesn't capture celestial usage cleanly

**BEST FIT**: Meaning #5+#6 combined: **Visible testimony of judgment — the dark covering that replaces glory.** Substitution passes all 51 occurrences. On people: glory departed, judgment acknowledged. On the sun: authority darkened, brightness replaced. On witnesses: their message IS judgment, their era IS darkness. On grain sacks: same coarse dark material that COVERS/CONTAINS.
