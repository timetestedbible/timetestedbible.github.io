## Context Bag

**DEFINITIONAL**: Isa 40:6-7 states FLESH = GRASS = PEOPLE explicitly twice → "All flesh is grass" + "surely the people is grass." 1Pet 1:24-25 quotes Isa 40:6-8 into NT, confirming equation. Isa 51:12 → "son of man which shall be made as grass."

**FUNCTIONAL**: Grass flourishes briefly → Ps 103:15 (man's days as grass) + Ps 90:5-6 (morning grows, evening cut down = lifetime in a day). Withers under WIND/Spirit → Isa 40:7 (spirit of LORD bloweth upon it). Cut down in judgment → Ps 37:2 (wicked cut down like grass). Burns → Rev 8:7 (all green grass burnt up = judgment on people; co-occurs w/ TREE → nations: third of trees burnt + all grass burnt). Feeds cattle → Ps 104:14 (grass grows for cattle; if ANIMAL → people/tribes, then people sustain larger structures).

**ANTITHETICAL**: Grass || Word of God as opposite pair. Grass withers vs. Word stands forever (Isa 40:8). Grass fades vs. Word endures (1Pet 1:25). PEOPLE = temporary; God's Word = eternal.

**BEHAVIORAL**: Matt 6:30 / Luke 12:28 → God clothes grass (temporary people/effort); trust God not human glory. Jas 1:10-11 → rich man fades like flower of grass; don't boast in riches.

**PROPHETIC**: Rev 8:7 → all green grass burnt = all living people suffer judgment + TREE co-occurrence. Rev 9:4 → "not hurt the grass... but only those men without seal" → grass = God's people protected; unsealed hurt. || Ezek 9:4-6 MARK pattern (sealed/marked spared).

**TYPES OF GRASS**: Wheat, barley, tares = subtypes of grass = subtypes of people. Matt 13:25-30, 36-43 → wheat = children of kingdom, tares = children of wicked one (Matt 13:38). Both grasses, indistinguishable until harvest (judgment) → sorted by FRUIT. Barley → firstfruits/early harvest (Ruth 1:22, Rev 14:15-16).

**FLOWER**: Flower of grass = glory/elite of people. Isa 40:6 → "goodliness thereof as flower of field." Jas 1:10-11 → rich man = flower of grass, passes away. Even the best of humanity withers.

**אַיִן PATTERN** (H369 connection): Isa 40:7 → PEOPLE = GRASS. WIND (רוּחַ) of LORD blows on grass → Ps 103:16 → wind passes over, it is **gone** (אַיִן H369) + "place thereof shall know it no more." || 2Kgs 2:16 → Spirit (רוּחַ) of LORD took Elijah up. Same mechanism: Spirit/WIND acts on people/grass → אַיִן (gone/removed). Surface = mortality; deeper = divine removal.

**NEBUCHADNEZZAR**: Dan 4:25-33 → king eats grass as oxen. Symbolic: great TREE (Dan 4:10-12, nation) cut down; reduced to consuming grass (common people) as beast. TREE → GRASS reduction.

**SUBSTITUTION**: All contexts resolve with PEOPLE: "all flesh is [people]" ✓; "not hurt [people] of earth" ✓; "all green [people] burnt up" ✓; "[people] grow for cattle" ✓.
