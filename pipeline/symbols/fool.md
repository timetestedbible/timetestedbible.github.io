## Context Bag
KEY: FOOL → Disobedient. Not lack of intelligence → lack of submission. Self-willed rebel who hears but does NOT do.

OPPOSITE DEFINES MEANING: WISE = does commandments (Ps 111:10, Prov 10:8) → FOOL = does NOT do commandments = disobedient. Prov 12:15 wise hearkens || fool right in own eyes. Prov 15:5 wise regards reproof || fool despises instruction.

DIRECT PROOFS: Titus 3:3 — "foolish, disobedient" paired as synonyms → explicit equation. Matt 7:26 — hears + does NOT → called FOOL = definition of disobedience. Gal 3:1 — "foolish Galatians… not obey TRUTH" → fool = not obeying. Ps 14:1/53:1 — fool denies God → corrupt works, none doeth good → root disobedience.

HEBREW WORDS: H5036 nabal = vile/wicked (Ps 14:1); H3684 kesiyl = fat/stupid, sports in mischief (Proverbs); H191 eviyl = despises wisdom+instruction (Prov 1:7); H5530 sakal = follows own understanding (Ecclesiastes). GREEK: G3474 mōros = heedless, hears+does NOT (Matt 7:26); G878 aphrōn = senseless, self-focused (Lk 12:20); G453 anoētos = without understanding, not obeying (Gal 3:1). ALL converge → rejecting God's instruction, following own WAY.

PATTERN — FOOL DOES: despises instruction (Prov 1:7, 15:5), hates knowledge (Prov 1:22), right in own eyes (Prov 12:15), mocks sin (Prov 14:9), trusts own heart (Prov 28:26), follows own spirit (Ezek 13:3), no delight in understanding (Prov 18:2), abomination to depart evil (Prov 13:19). Common thread → self-trust, rejection of external instruction = DISOBEDIENCE.

PARABLES: Matt 7:24-27 — wise builds on ROCK (covenant) + does || foolish builds on SAND + does NOT. Matt 25:1-13 — wise VIRGIN had OIL (proven works) || foolish VIRGIN had no OIL → both had lamps (outward) but only obedient had FRUIT/works. Lk 12:16-21 — rich fool stored for SELF not God → IDOLATRY in action.

PARADOX: 1 Cor 3:18 — "become fool to be wise" → become disobedient to worldly wisdom = obedient to God. 1 Cor 4:10 — "fools for Christ" = disobedient to world, obedient to Christ. Dual application confirmed.

SYMBOL WEB: FOOL = character of IDOLATRY (self-rule) → opposite of FAITH (obedience). FOOL despises TRUTH (God's standard). FOOL embodies WICKEDNESS (lawlessness). FOOL walks own WAY not THE WAY (Torah). BELIEVE = obey → FOOL refuses to commit.
