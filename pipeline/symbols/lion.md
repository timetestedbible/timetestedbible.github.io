**H738 ari/arieh** = "a lion" from H717 arah (in sense of violence). PRIMARY Hebrew word. H3833 labiy/labi = "a lion, lioness; old lion, great lion" — mature/fierce. H3715 kephir = "a young lion" — emerging power. H744 aryeh (Aramaic) = lion (Dan 7:4). **G3023 leon** = "a lion" (primary word).

## Context Bag

Gen 49:9 — subj: JUDAH = lion's whelp. Stooped, couched as H738 + H3833. "Who shall rouse him?" co: THRONE, JUDAH. Messianic: lion lies down at will, none dares disturb. Scepter passage (49:10) follows immediately.
Num 23:24, 24:9 — subj: ISRAEL = great lion rising, couching. "Blessed is he who blesses, cursed who curses." Balaam's oracle. co: BLESSING. Nation-as-lion when aligned with God.
Deut 33:22 — subj: DAN = lion's whelp leaping from Bashan. cf. Gen 49:17 Dan = serpent. Same tribe, dual symbols: lion (power) + serpent (cunning).
Judg 14:5-9 — subj: Samson kills young H738 lion; HONEY from carcass. "Out of the strong came sweetness." co: HONEY. Literal + parabolic: devourer becomes source of sweetness. Death of lion-power produces good.
1Sam 17:34-37 — subj: David slew H738 lion + H1677 bear. Trained for Goliath. co: BEAR, SHEPHERD, SHEEP. Shepherd's proving: lion+bear before giant. Pattern: overcome predators → overcome empire.
1Ki 10:19-20 — subj: Solomon's THRONE flanked by 12 lions on 6 steps. co: THRONE, GOLD. Royal guardians of authority. "Nothing like it in any kingdom." Lion = visible sign of kingship.
1Ki 13:24-28 — subj: lion kills disobedient prophet but does NOT eat corpse or tear donkey. co: JUDGMENT. Lion as PRECISE divine judgment agent — not random predation. Controlled violence.
2Ki 17:25-26 — subj: God sent lions among those settled in Samaria who "feared not the LORD." co: JUDGMENT. Lions enforce covenant-territory. Land rejects those ignorant of its God.
Job 4:10 — subj: roaring lion, fierce lion, young lions — TEETH BROKEN. co: JUDGMENT. Even the mightiest predatory power is shattered by God.
Ps 22:13, 21 — subj: enemies gape as ravening+roaring lion. "Save me from lion's mouth." co: HORN (v21). Messianic psalm: crucifixion scene. Lions = persecuting powers surrounding the Suffering Servant.
Prov 28:1 — subj: RIGHTEOUS bold as lion. WICKED flee when none pursues. co: BOLDNESS. Lion = confidence from right standing.
Prov 28:15 — subj: roaring lion + ranging BEAR = wicked RULER over poor. co: BEAR. Lion+bear: political predation pattern. Same pairing as 1Sam 17, Dan 7.
Isa 11:7 — subj: lion eats STRAW like ox in restored kingdom. co: BEAR (v7). Predatory nature removed. Isa 65:25 — same: lion eats straw, serpent eats dust. Kingdom = lion defanged, serpent declawed.
Isa 31:4 — subj: LORD = lion roaring over prey. Multitude of shepherds cannot frighten Him. co: SHEPHERD. God-as-lion: unstoppable sovereign protection of Zion.
Jer 4:7 — subj: lion from thicket = destroyer of nations coming against Judah. co: JUDGMENT. Empire = lion advancing.
Lam 3:10 — subj: God = bear lying in wait, lion in secret places. co: BEAR. God-as-predator against His own people in judgment.
Dan 7:4 — subj: FIRST BEAST = lion with eagle's wings. Wings plucked, stood as man, man's heart given. co: EAGLE, BEAST. Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar). Lion-empire humbled: wings removed → stands upright → given human heart. Inverse of Nebuchadnezzar's madness/restoration (Dan 4).
2Tim 4:17 — subj: Paul delivered from lion's mouth. co: PERSECUTION. Roman empire as lion.
1Pet 5:8 — subj: adversary the devil as ROARING lion, seeking whom to devour. co: DRAGON, DECEIVE. Satan mimics the lion-role. Roaring = intimidation (not stealth — that's the serpent).
Rev 4:7 — subj: first living creature = face of lion. co: THRONE. Before God's throne. Majesty/kingship represented.
Rev 5:5 — subj: LION of tribe of JUDAH, Root of David, has prevailed to open the book. THEN John sees a LAMB as slain (v6). co: LAMB, THRONE, JUDAH. The Lion IS the Lamb. Power exercised through sacrifice. KEY PARADOX of Scripture.
Rev 9:8, 17 — subj: locust-army teeth like lions; horse-heads like lions with fire+smoke. co: LOCUST, FIRE. Judgment forces bearing lion-nature = devouring power.
Rev 10:3 — subj: angel cried as when lion roars → seven thunders. co: THUNDER. Divine announcement.
Rev 13:2 — subj: composite beast: leopard body + BEAR feet + LION mouth. Dragon gives it power. co: BEAR, DRAGON, BEAST. Lion mouth = devouring speech/decrees. Dan 7 beasts MERGED into one.

**CANDIDATES**: (1) Kingship/sovereignty → Gen 49:9, Rev 5:5, throne imagery — strong. (2) Predation/devouring power → 1Pet 5:8, Prov 28:15, judgment passages — strong. (3) Courage/boldness → Prov 28:1, 2Sam 1:23, 17:10 — partial. (4) Divine judgment agent → 1Ki 13, 2Ki 17, Lam 3:10 — partial. (5) Empire → Dan 7:4 Babylon-as-lion — partial. (6) Unstoppable authority → Isa 31:4, Num 23:24, Gen 49:9 "who shall rouse?" — strong. (7) Righteous + predatory authority merged → BEST: substitutes in all contexts. Righteous lion (Rev 5:5, Prov 28:1) and wicked lion (1Pet 5:8, Prov 28:15) = same POWER, different wielder. Lion = sovereign dominion exercised.

**PATTERNS**: (1) DUAL LION: Christ (Rev 5:5) + Satan (1Pet 5:8) both claim lion identity. Lion is not inherently good or evil — it's RAW AUTHORITY. Whose hand holds it determines outcome. (2) LION = LAMB PARADOX: Rev 5:5-6 announces lion, reveals lamb. True kingship = self-sacrifice. The roar of the lion IS the silence of the lamb. (3) LION+BEAR: consistently paired — 1Sam 17 (David's proving), Prov 28:15 (wicked rulers), Dan 7 (empires 1+2), Rev 13:2 (merged beast). Ascending threat: lion first, bear second. (4) DAN 7 MERGER: four separate beast-empires (lion, bear, leopard, iron-beast) → Rev 13:2 combines ALL into one composite. History compresses into final system. (5) DEFANGED LION: Isa 11:7, 65:25 — kingdom restores lion to herbivore. Predatory authority removed. Creation order restored.
