## Context Bag

**Core definition**: DARKNESS → concealed disobedience; state of hiding conduct from scrutiny. Opposite of LIGHT (visible obedience). Not primarily ignorance or abstract evil—specifically about HIDING.

**1. Definitional**: God=LIGHT, no DARKNESS in him (1Jn1:5). LIGHT||righteousness vs DARKNESS||unrighteousness (2Cor6:14). Men loved DARKNESS because deeds evil (Jn3:19). WAY of WICKED=DARKNESS (Prov4:19).

**2. Concealment** (core distinctive): Evil-doers hate LIGHT, won't come to it lest deeds reproved (Jn3:20). Works of DARKNESS=things done in secret, shame to speak of (Eph5:11-12). Workers of iniquity seek to hide in DARKNESS—but cannot (Job34:22). Lord brings to LIGHT hidden things of DARKNESS (1Cor4:5). God reveals secret things in DARKNESS (Dan2:22).

**3. Functional**: DARKNESS blinds (1Jn2:11, Ps82:5) + causes confusion—walk in DARKNESS, know not whither going (Jn12:35, Prov4:19) + conceals (Job34:22, Dan2:22, 1Cor4:5) + produces shame (Eph5:12) + associates with Satan's power (Acts26:18, Lk22:53, Col1:13).

**4. Antithetical** (LIGHT↔DARKNESS): Visible↔hidden; obedience↔disobedience; TRUTH↔lie (1Jn1:6); exposed deeds (Jn3:21)↔concealed deeds (Jn3:20); good works seen (Mt5:16)↔shameful works secret (Eph5:12). DARKNESS=exact mirror of LIGHT.

**5. Behavioral commands**: Do NOT walk in DARKNESS (1Jn1:6, Jn8:12, Jn12:35). Cast off works of DARKNESS (Rom13:12). No fellowship with works of DARKNESS (Eph5:11). Turn FROM DARKNESS TO LIGHT (Acts26:18). All commands→stop hiding, come into open.

**6. Why "concealed disobedience" not alternatives**: "Ignorance"=result not meaning (those in DARKNESS "know not"). "Evil"=too vague, misses hiding aspect. "Sin"=partial, DARKNESS specifically involves concealment of sin. "Concealed disobedience" unifies all functions + mirrors LIGHT perfectly.

**7. Human application**: Humans BE darkness—"ye were sometimes DARKNESS" (Eph5:8). Claim LIGHT but hate brother→in DARKNESS (1Jn2:9,11). Walking in DARKNESS while claiming fellowship=lying (1Jn1:6). Meaning must apply to human conduct.

**8. Secret connection**: Done in secret (Eph5:12) || Israel did secretly things not right (2Ki17:9) || David did it secretly, God responds before all Israel + before the sun (2Sam12:12). DARKNESS=doing secretly what should be done openly; LIGHT=public exposure.

**Substitution test passes**: All major verses accept "concealed disobedience" cleanly—Jn3:19, Eph5:8, Eph5:11, Jn12:35, Acts26:18, Rom13:12, 1Jn1:5.
