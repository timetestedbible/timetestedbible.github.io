## Compound Symbol Components
ROCK/STONE = Covenant (H6697). MOUNTAIN = Kingdom/Ruling Authority (H2022). SEA = Nations/Peoples (H3220).
CAST INTO = irreversible removal. The ACTION of putting a solid thing into water = a kingdom/authority absorbed and destroyed among the nations. It SINKS — does not float, does not return.

## Context Bag

**EXODUS PATTERN (the type):** Exod 15:1,4,21 — Pharaoh's army "thrown into the sea." Exod 15:5 — "they sank to the bottom as a STONE." Exod 15:10 — "sank as LEAD in mighty waters." Neh 9:11 — "thou threwest into the deeps, as a STONE into mighty waters." The first instance: a ruling power (Pharaoh/Egypt) cast into the water (sea/nations) and sinking like a stone. Egypt's army = kingdom authority; sinking = irreversible destruction among the waters. 🔄Exodus cycle.

**JEREMIAH/BABYLON:** Jer 51:63-64 — Jeremiah ties a STONE to the book of prophecy and casts it into the Euphrates. "Thus shall BABYLON SINK, and shall not rise." The enacted prophecy: stone + water = Babylon's irreversible fall. The stone carries the prophetic WORD (dabar) — the Word itself is the weight that sinks Babylon. 🔄Babylon/Exile cycle.

**REVELATION/BABYLON THE GREAT:** Rev 18:21 — Angel takes "a stone like a great MILLSTONE" and casts it into the SEA: "Thus with violence shall that great city BABYLON be thrown down, and shall be found NO MORE AT ALL." Direct quote of Jer 51:63-64 pattern. MILLSTONE specific: millstone grinds GRAIN→BREAD→WORD. When the millstone is cast into the sea, the mechanism for producing Word is destroyed. Rev 18:22 — "the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more" confirms. This is FALL_OF_BABYLON symbol in action form.

**REVELATION 8:8:** "A great MOUNTAIN burning with FIRE was cast into the SEA; third of sea became blood." MOUNTAIN = kingdom (per study). Kingdom + fire (judgment) + cast into sea (nations) = a burning kingdom thrown among the peoples → destruction/blood. Second trumpet. Links to SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.

**JESUS — MOUNTAIN CAST INTO SEA:** Matt 21:21; Mk 11:23 — "say to this MOUNTAIN, be removed and cast into the SEA." Spoken on Mount of Olives FACING the temple mount. "This mountain" = temple/Jerusalem authority. Faith can declare a kingdom's removal into the nations. Not about moving literal mountains — about declaring kingdom-judgment.

**MILLSTONE AROUND NECK:** Matt 18:6; Mk 9:42; Lk 17:2 — offending little ones → millstone + drowned in sea. The offender is treated like Babylon: weighted and sunk. The mechanism of their authority (millstone/teaching) becomes the instrument of their drowning.

**PSALM 46:2:** "Though the MOUNTAINS be carried into the midst of the SEA" — even if kingdoms are swallowed by nations, we will not fear. God is our refuge. The compound symbol used to describe the WORST case scenario — and faith transcends it.

**PATTERN ACROSS ERAS:**
- Exodus: Pharaoh's army→sea (kingdom power destroyed among waters) 🔄Exodus
- Babylon: stone→Euphrates (Babylon sinks, never rises) 🔄Exile
- Jesus's prophecy: "this mountain"→sea (temple authority destroyed) 🔄Rome
- Revelation: burning mountain→sea + millstone→sea (Babylon the Great destroyed) 🔄Consummation

**CONSISTENT READING:** CAST INTO SEA = a ruling authority/kingdom irreversibly destroyed by being swallowed among the nations. The stone/mountain SINKS — it doesn't float, it doesn't return. Every instance: a power structure that set itself against God's covenant is terminated by being absorbed into the chaos of the peoples. The opposite would be a mountain RISING from the sea — a kingdom established from among the nations (cf Dan 2:35, stone becomes great mountain filling the earth).
