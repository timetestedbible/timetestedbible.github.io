## Compound Symbol Components
ROCK/STONE + MOUNTAIN + SEA → cast into = irreversible removal. Kingdom/authority absorbed + destroyed among nations. SINKS ≠ float ≠ return.

## Context Bag

**EXODUS PATTERN (type):** Exod 15:1,4,21,10 → Pharaoh's army cast into sea. 15:5 → "sank as STONE." Neh 9:11 → "STONE into mighty waters." Ruling power (Egypt) → waters (nations) = irreversible destruction. 🔄Exodus cycle.

**JEREMIAH/BABYLON:** Jer 51:63-64 → stone tied to prophecy book → Euphrates. "BABYLON SINK + shall not rise." Stone carries prophetic WORD = weight that sinks Babylon. 🔄Babylon/Exile cycle.

**REVELATION/BABYLON THE GREAT:** Rev 18:21 → angel takes "MILLSTONE" → SEA: "BABYLON thrown down + found NO MORE." Direct quote Jer 51:63-64. MILLSTONE grinds GRAIN→BREAD→WORD. Millstone → sea = mechanism producing Word destroyed. Rev 18:22 → "millstone sound heard no more" confirms. = FALL_OF_BABYLON in action.

**REV 8:8:** "MOUNTAIN burning with FIRE cast into SEA; third → blood." Kingdom + judgment + cast → nations = destruction/blood. Second trumpet → SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.

**JESUS — MOUNTAIN → SEA:** Matt 21:21; Mk 11:23 → "this MOUNTAIN, be removed → SEA." spkr: Mount of Olives facing temple mount. "This mountain" = temple/Jerusalem authority. Faith declares kingdom-judgment ≠ literal mountains.

**MILLSTONE AROUND NECK:** Matt 18:6; Mk 9:42; Lk 17:2 → offending little ones → millstone + drowned. Offender treated like Babylon: weighted + sunk. Authority mechanism becomes drowning instrument.

**PSALM 46:2:** "MOUNTAINS carried → midst of SEA" → we will not fear. Kingdoms swallowed by nations = WORST scenario → faith transcends.

**PATTERN ACROSS ERAS:**
- Exodus: Pharaoh's army→sea (kingdom power destroyed) 🔄Exodus
- Babylon: stone→Euphrates (Babylon sinks forever) 🔄Exile  
- Jesus: "this mountain"→sea (temple authority destroyed) 🔄Rome
- Revelation: burning mountain→sea + millstone→sea (Babylon Great destroyed) 🔄Consummation

**CONSISTENT:** CAST INTO SEA = ruling authority/kingdom irreversibly destroyed by absorption among nations. SINKS ≠ float ≠ return. Every instance: power vs God's covenant → terminated via chaos of peoples. Opposite: mountain RISING from sea = kingdom established from nations (Dan 2:35).
