## Context Bag

**H972 bachiyr** = "select, chosen one" from H977 bachar = "to TRY, i.e. by implication SELECT." 13× OT. ROOT: bachar = to test/prove THEN choose. ≠ arbitrary preference — selection follows examination. Cognate H974 bachan = "to TEST (especially METALS); investigate, examine, prove, try." The elect are the metal that PASSED the refiner's fire. **G1588 eklektos** = "select; by implication, favorite" from G1586 eklegomai = to pick out. 23× NT.

**ETYMOLOGY IS THE KEY:** H977 bachar (choose) parallels H974 bachan (test metals). Election in Hebrew is inherently tied to TESTING — the chosen one is the PROVEN one. This is not arbitrary favoritism; it is the result of a refining process. God chooses what has been tested. Mal 3:2-3 refiner's fire + fuller's soap → purify sons of Levi = the TESTING that produces the elect.

**ISA 42:1 — THE DEFINING VERSE:** "My servant, whom I uphold; mine ELECT (H972), in whom my soul DELIGHTS." co: SERVANT, SPIRIT (put upon him), JUDGMENT (brings to nations). The primary Elect One = the Servant-Messiah. All subsequent elect derive identity from Him. Lk 23:35 "if he be Christ, the CHOSEN (G1588) of God" → crowd unknowingly applies the Isa 42:1 title.

**PSALMS — ISRAEL AS CHOSEN:** 1Chr 16:13 / Ps 105:6 "children of Jacob his CHOSEN." Ps 89:3 covenant with "my CHOSEN" (David). Ps 105:43 "brought forth his people with joy, his CHOSEN with gladness." Ps 106:5 "see the good of thy CHOSEN." Ps 106:23 "Moses his CHOSEN stood in the breach." CORPORATE identity: Israel collectively = elect. But Moses individually = elect standing for the many.

**ISA 45:4 — CYRUS CALLED FOR ELECT'S SAKE:** "For Jacob my SERVANT'S sake, and Israel mine ELECT, I have called thee [Cyrus] by NAME." God moves pagan kings for the benefit of His elect. co: NAME, SERVANT. Election creates obligation on God's side — He orchestrates history around His chosen.

**ISA 65:9,15,22 — ELECT INHERIT:** "Mine ELECT shall inherit" the mountains. "Ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my CHOSEN" (wicked). "Mine ELECT shall long enjoy the work of their hands." Future tense — inheritance/enjoyment is eschatological. co: MOUNTAIN, NAME, FRUIT.

**MAT 24:22 — DAYS SHORTENED FOR ELECT:** "Except those days should be shortened, no flesh saved; but for the ELECT'S sake those days shall be shortened." God intervenes in history's timeline specifically to preserve the elect. co: RETURN_OF_CHRIST, DECEIVE, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.

**MAT 24:24 — FALSE CHRISTS DECEIVE ELECT (IF POSSIBLE):** "Shall show great signs and wonders; insomuch that, IF IT WERE POSSIBLE, they shall DECEIVE the very ELECT." G1487+G1415 (ei dynaton) = conditional: "if it were possible" — implies it is NOT possible. co: DECEIVE, FALSE PROPHETS. The elect are those who CANNOT be permanently deceived. This IS the mark of election: withstanding deception when others fall.

**MAT 24:31 — ELECT GATHERED:** "Send his angels with great sound of TRUMPET, and gather together his ELECT from the FOUR WINDS." co: TRUMPET, FOUR_WINDS, RAPTURE_GATHERING. Mk 13:27 parallel adds "from uttermost part of EARTH to uttermost part of HEAVEN." The elect = those gathered at the trumpet. Universal scope — from everywhere.

**MAT 22:14 / MAT 20:16 — MANY CALLED, FEW CHOSEN:** G2822 kletos (called) vs G1588 eklektos (chosen). The CALLED is a larger set than the CHOSEN. Calling precedes selection. The wedding feast has many invitees; the chosen are those who came properly prepared (wedding garment = TESTED + found adequate). The man without garment = called but not chosen = untested/unprepared.

**ROM 8:33 — CHARGE AGAINST ELECT:** "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's ELECT? It is God that justifieth." Legal language: no accusation can stick because GOD is the justifier. co: FAITH. The elect are legally unassailable — not because sinless, but because God's testing declared them proven and His justification covers them.

**1PET 1:2 — ELECT ACCORDING TO FOREKNOWLEDGE:** "ELECT according to FOREKNOWLEDGE of God, through SANCTIFICATION of Spirit, unto OBEDIENCE and sprinkling of blood." Three-stage process: (1) foreknown, (2) sanctified/set apart, (3) resulting in obedience + blood-covering. Election is not one-step but process.

**1PET 2:4,6,9 — LIVING STONE + CHOSEN GENERATION:** Christ = living stone "CHOSEN of God, precious" (2:4). Foundation stone "ELECT, precious" (2:6). "Ye are a CHOSEN generation, royal priesthood" (2:9). The elect-stone is the foundation; those built on Him become collectively elected. co: ROCK, NAME.

**COL 3:12 — ELECT PUT ON:** "As the ELECT of God, holy and beloved, put on bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness..." Election carries behavioral obligation. Status demands character.

**REV 17:14 — CALLED, CHOSEN, FAITHFUL:** "They that are with him are CALLED, and CHOSEN, and FAITHFUL." Three terms in ascending order: called (invited) → chosen (selected through testing) → faithful (proven through endurance). The complete progression. co: RETURN_OF_CHRIST, FALL_OF_BABYLON.

**LK 18:7 — GOD AVENGES HIS ELECT:** "Shall not God avenge his own ELECT, which cry day and night unto him?" The elect are those who persist in prayer under oppression. God's delay is not indifference — He bears long, then acts suddenly.

**2TIM 2:10 — ENDURE ALL FOR ELECT'S SAKE:** Paul "endures all things for the ELECT'S sakes, that they may also obtain salvation with eternal glory." co: FAITH, ENDURANCE. The elect are worth suffering for.

**PATTERN:** (1) Root meaning = tested/proven through refining (H977→H974). (2) Primary Elect = Messiah-Servant (Isa 42:1); all others derive from Him. (3) Cannot be permanently deceived (Mat 24:24). (4) History shortened for their preservation (Mat 24:22). (5) Gathered at trumpet from four winds (Mat 24:31). (6) Called→chosen→faithful = progressive chain (Rev 17:14). (7) Many called, few chosen — calling ≠ election (Mat 22:14). (8) Legally unassailable (Rom 8:33). (9) Election produces obligation: character (Col 3:12), endurance (2Tim 2:10), prayer (Lk 18:7).
