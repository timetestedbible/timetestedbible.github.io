## Context Bag

STUB — needs full study.

Key connections to BABYLON already identified:
- Self-deifying ruler: Pharaoh "my river is mine, I made it" (Ezek 29:3) = Babylon's "I am, none else beside me" (Isa 47:8)
- Nation-against-nation: Isa 19:2 "Egyptians against Egyptians, city against city, kingdom against kingdom" = Mat 24:7 / 2Chr 15:6 vocabulary
- Sorceries: Isa 19:3 "charmers, familiar spirits, wizards" = Isa 47:12 Babylon's sorceries
- Drunken stupor: Isa 19:14 "drunken man staggering in vomit" = Jer 51:57 Babylon's rulers drunk
- Rev 11:8 explicitly calls Jerusalem "Sodom and Egypt" — names are FUNCTIONAL, not geographic
- Egypt = first system God's people must "come out of" (Exodus) → Jer 51:6/Rev 18:4 = final "come out"
- Plagues on Egypt = template for Revelation bowls/trumpets

QUEUE: Full symbol-study needed. Compare all Egypt oracles (Isa 19, Ezek 29-32) with Babylon oracles (Jer 50-51, Isa 13-14, 47) and Rev 17-18. Map shared vocabulary.
