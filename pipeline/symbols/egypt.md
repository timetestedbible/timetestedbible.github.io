## Etymology — The Name IS the Meaning

H4714 Mitsrayim = DUAL of H4693 matsôwr = H4692 "something hemming in, siege, distress, fortress" from H6696 tsûwr = "to cramp, confine."
Name literally = "double confinement." Same root H6696 → H6697 tsûr = ROCK. Egypt confines to IMPRISON; Rock confines to PROTECT. Same compression, opposite function.
Isa 19:6 puns on root: "brooks of defence [H4693 matsôwr]" = Egypt's own name-word. Rivers of confinement dried up.
G125 Aigyptos = uncertain derivation. H6547 Par'ôh = Pharaoh, generic royal title — ruler inseparable from system.

## Context Bag

Gen 47:20-25 — subj: people sell land+selves for bread. co: GRAIN. Provision IS the enslavement mechanism.
Exod 1:11-14 — subj: Israel enslaved. co: BRICK+BONDAGE. Built with BRICK (=Gen 11:3 Babylon). Iron furnace (Deut 4:20, 1Ki 8:51, Jer 11:4) = refining through bondage.
Deut 28:68 — subj: covenant curse. "Bring thee into Egypt again" = symbolic destination, not just geographic.
Exod 5:2 — subj: "Who is the LORD?" co: NAME. Refuses God's authority. Hardened heart 13× = system's defining refusal.
Ezek 29:3 — subj: Pharaoh = great H8577-tanniyn in rivers. "My river is mine, I MADE it." co: DRAGON, SEA. = Isa 47:8 Babylon's self-deifying claim.
Ezek 31:10 — subj: Pharaoh as TREE exalted. co: TREE. = Dan 4:30 Nebuchadnezzar. Same metaphor → same fall.
Isa 19:11 — subj: "son of the wise, son of ancient kings." False-authority claim.
Exod 7-12 — subj: plague template. Each targets a god. Exod 12:12 "against ALL GODS of Egypt." BLOOD, DARKNESS (3 days, Israel had LIGHT), FIRSTBORN, HAIL+FIRE.
Rev 16 mirrors: sores→sea/rivers blood→darkness on beast's kingdom→FROGS from mouths→hail. Egypt's plagues = Revelation's bowl template.
Rev 15:3 — subj: "song of Moses AND the Lamb." Sea of glass+FIRE = Red Sea + fire fused. Rev 11:6 — witnesses have Moses-authority: waters→blood, ALL PLAGUES.
Isa 19:2 — subj: "Egyptians against Egyptians, kingdom against kingdom" = Mat 24:7 exact vocabulary. EGYPT = SOURCE TEXT for birth-pains pattern.
Isa 19:3 — subj: seek idols+sorcerers. co: SORCERY. = Isa 47:12-13 Babylon. Rev 18:23 same chain.
Isa 19:14 — subj: drunken staggering. co: WINE. = Jer 51:57 Babylon's rulers drunk.
Ezek 29:6-7 — subj: staff of REED. Breaks when leaned on = false support. Isa 30:1-2, 31:1-3 — "Woe to them that go to Egypt for help." Horses=flesh not spirit. co: FAITH (competing trust).
Rev 11:8 — subj: "great city SPIRITUALLY called Sodom AND Egypt." co: SODOM. Names = functional. Sodom = moral face; Egypt = bondage face.
2Tim 3:8-9 — subj: Jannes/Jambres = Egypt's magicians, counterfeit power. "Folly manifest."
Heb 11:27 — subj: "by faith forsook Egypt." Faith = invisible God over visible provision.
Jude 1:5 — subj: saved OUT of Egypt, afterward destroyed unbelievers. Extraction ≠ salvation.
Isa 19:22 — subj: "SMITE Egypt: smite AND HEAL." co: HEALING. CRITICAL DISTINCTION: smite+heal in one sentence.
Isa 19:25 — subj: "Blessed be EGYPT MY PEOPLE." Egypt's people become God's people.
Isa 19:19 — subj: altar to LORD in midst of Egypt. Highway Egypt→Assyria. Reformation, not destruction.
Jer 46:26 — subj: "afterward inhabited as in days of old." Egypt recovers.
CONTRAST: Jer 51:9 "would have healed Babylon, NOT healed." Babylon = unhealable. Egypt = reformable. People in Egypt-type systems saveable.
Ezek 29:3, 32:2 — subj: Pharaoh = H8577 tanniyn in seas. co: DRAGON, SEA. = Rev 12:9. God catches in NET (32:3) = cast-into-sea judgment.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **"Land of slavery"** — Isa 30:1 "go down to [slavery] for help" ✗. Why seek help FROM slavery?
2. **"Worldly provision system"** — Exod 1:14 "hard bondage in [provision]" ✗. Misses bondage.
3. **"Confinement"** (etymological only) — Isa 30:1 "go down to [confinement] for help" ✗. Doesn't explain refuge-seeking.
4. **"System of man-made security"** — Gen 47:20 ✓, Isa 30 ✓, but Exod bondage ≈. Thin on slavery.
5. **"Self-sustaining human authority"** — Ezek 29:3 ✓, Exod 5:2 ✓, but Gen 47 provision-mechanism ≈.
6. **"Confinement through provision"** (etymology + mechanism) — ALL passages ✓. Name=meaning. Provides→confines→enslaves. Exod 1 ✓, Gen 47 ✓, Isa 30 ✓ (seek the fortress), Isa 19 ✓, Rev 11:8 ✓, Ezek 29 ✓.
7. **"Babylon's bondage face"** (relational to Babylon) — ALL passages ✓. Egypt within Babylon system, specifically the enslaving mechanism. Distinguishes from Tyre (commercial), Sodom (moral). Explains why healable (face ≠ whole).

**SELECTED: #6 + #7 combined.** Egypt = confinement through provision. System enslaves through material dependence. Ruled by self-deifying authority (Pharaoh-dragon). Babylon's bondage face. Judged by plagues but healable — the PEOPLE can be redeemed even when the SYSTEM is judged.

## Pattern Summary

**Egypt's cycle:** PROVIDE → DEPEND → CONFINE → HARDEN → PLAGUE → EXTRACT
- Gen 47: provide grain → people become servants
- Exod 1-15: harden heart → plagues escalate → Israel extracted → army destroyed
- Isa 19: civil war → sorcery → drunkenness → smite AND heal
- Rev 15-16: bowl plagues replay Egypt plagues on Babylon → extraction (Rev 18:4 "come out")

**EGYPT || BABYLON || TYRE || SODOM — One system, four faces:**
- EGYPT = bondage face (enslaves through provision) — HEALABLE
- TYRE = commercial face (corrupts through trade, Ezek 27 → Rev 18) — fire from within (Ezek 28:18)
- SODOM = moral face (corrupts through indulgence) — fire from above (Gen 19:24)
- BABYLON = the whole system (self-deifying replacement of God's rule) — UNHEALABLE (Jer 51:9)

**Plague template: Exodus → Revelation mapping:**
- BLOOD: Nile (Exod 7:20) → sea+rivers (Rev 16:3-4)
- BOILS: Exod 9:9 → sores (Rev 16:2)
- HAIL+FIRE: Exod 9:24 → Rev 8:7, Rev 16:21
- DARKNESS: Exod 10:22 (3 days) → beast's kingdom (Rev 16:10)
- FROGS: Exod 8:2 → dragon/beast/false-prophet mouths (Rev 16:13)
- FIRSTBORN: Exod 12:29 → ∅ (gap — or: "Babylon is fallen" = firstborn system destroyed?)
- LOCUSTS: Exod 10:4 → Rev 9:3 (5th trumpet)

**Hardened heart = system's signature:** 13× in Exodus. Sometimes Pharaoh hardens, sometimes God hardens. System + sovereign judgment interlock. Rev 16:9,11 "repented not" = same pattern at global scale.
