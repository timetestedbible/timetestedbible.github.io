## Etymology — The Name IS the Meaning

H4714 Mitsrayim = DUAL of H4693 matsôwr = H4692 "something hemming in, siege, distress, fortress" from H6696 tsûwr = "to cramp, confine."
Name literally = "double confinement." Same root H6696 → H6697 tsûr = ROCK. Egypt confines to IMPRISON; Rock confines to PROTECT. Same compression, opposite function.
Isa 19:6 puns on root: "brooks of defence [H4693 matsôwr]" = Egypt's own name-word. Rivers of confinement dried up.
G125 Aigyptos = uncertain derivation. H6547 Par'ôh = Pharaoh, generic royal title — ruler inseparable from system.

## Context Bag

**PROVISION-TO-BONDAGE MECHANISM:**
Gen 47:20-25 — subj: people sell land+selves for bread. co: GRAIN. "We will be Pharaoh's servants." Provision IS the enslavement mechanism.
Exod 1:11-14 — subj: Israel enslaved. co: BRICK+BONDAGE. Built with BRICK (= Gen 11:3 Babylon's brick). Iron furnace (Deut 4:20, 1Ki 8:51, Jer 11:4) = REFINING through bondage.
Deut 28:68 — subj: covenant curse. "LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again" = SYMBOLIC destination, not just geographic.

**SELF-DEIFYING RULER:**
Exod 5:2 — "Who is the LORD?" = refuses God's NAME/authority. Hardened heart 13× = system's defining refusal.
Ezek 29:3 — "Great dragon [H8577 tanniyn] in midst of rivers... My river is mine, I MADE it." = Isa 47:8 Babylon's "I am, none else." Self-created claim.
Ezek 31:10 — Pharaoh as TREE exalted, heart lifted in height = Dan 4:30 Nebuchadnezzar exactly. Same tree metaphor → same fall.
Isa 19:11 — "I am son of the wise, son of ancient kings" = false-authority claim. Wisdom becomes brutish.

**PLAGUE-JUDGMENT TEMPLATE:**
Exod 7-12 — Each plague targets a god/claim. Exod 12:12 "against ALL GODS of Egypt I execute judgment." BLOOD (Nile→death), FROGS, DARKNESS (3 days, but Israel had LIGHT, 10:23), FIRSTBORN, HAIL+FIRE (9:24).
Rev 16 mirrors: sores (boils), sea→blood, rivers→blood, darkness on beast's kingdom (16:10), FROGS from mouths (16:13), hail (16:21). Egypt's plagues = Revelation's bowl template.
Rev 15:3 — Victors sing "song of Moses AND the Lamb" = Exod 15 + final deliverance merged. Sea of glass mingled with FIRE (15:2) = Red Sea + fire judgment fused.
Rev 11:6 — Two witnesses: "power over waters to turn to blood, smite earth with ALL PLAGUES" = Moses authority.

**NATION-AGAINST-NATION VOCABULARY:**
Isa 19:2 — "Egyptians against Egyptians, city against city, kingdom [H4467] against kingdom [H4467]" = Mat 24:7 / 2Chr 15:6 exact vocabulary. EGYPT is the SOURCE TEXT for the birth-pains pattern.
Isa 19:3 — Spirit fails → seek idols, charmers [H328], familiar spirits [H178], wizards [H3049] = Isa 47:12-13 Babylon's sorceries. Rev 18:23 "by thy sorceries all nations deceived." Same chain.
Isa 19:14 — "Drunken man staggering in vomit" = Jer 51:57 Babylon's rulers drunk. WINE judgment vocabulary shared.

**REED-STAFF / FALSE REFUGE:**
Ezek 29:6-7 — "Staff of REED to house of Israel" = breaks when leaned on. False support.
Isa 30:1-2, 31:1-3 — "Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help." Horses = flesh, not spirit. Trusting Egypt = competing trust system.
Isa 31:3 — "Egyptians are MEN and not God; horses FLESH not spirit" = fundamental category error.

**FUNCTIONAL NAME — EGYPT IS A ROLE:**
Rev 11:8 — "Great city SPIRITUALLY [G4153] called Sodom AND Egypt where Lord crucified." Names = FUNCTIONAL. Sodom = moral-corruption face; Egypt = bondage face. ANY system that enslaves + corrupts = "Sodom and Egypt."
2Tim 3:8-9 — Jannes/Jambres = Egypt's magicians resisting truth with counterfeit power. "Folly shall be manifest" = sorcery always exposed.
Heb 11:27 — "By faith forsook Egypt" = deliberate exit. Faith = choosing invisible God over visible provision.
Jude 1:5 — "Saved out of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not." Post-Egypt rebellion: extraction ≠ salvation.

**HEALABLE — THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
Isa 19:22 — "LORD shall SMITE Egypt: he shall smite AND HEAL." Smite [H5062] + heal [H7495] in one sentence.
Isa 19:25 — "Blessed be EGYPT MY PEOPLE, Assyria work of my hands, Israel mine inheritance." Egypt's people become God's people.
Isa 19:19 — Altar to LORD IN MIDST of Egypt. Highway Egypt→Assyria. Reformation, not destruction.
Jer 46:26 — "Afterward it shall be inhabited, as in days of old." Egypt recovers.
CONTRAST: Jer 51:9 "We would have healed Babylon, but she is NOT healed." Babylon = unredeemable system. Egypt = reformable bondage.
Implication: the PEOPLE trapped in Egypt-type systems are saveable. The system breaks; the people are gathered.

**PHARAOH AS DRAGON:**
Ezek 29:3 — H8577 tanniyn = "dragon/sea-monster/serpent." Same word family as Rev 12:9 "great dragon, that old serpent."
Ezek 32:2 — H8577 again: "whale [tanniyn] in the seas [H3220]." Pharaoh = dragon IN the sea = ruler in the nations. Troubles waters = stirs nations.
God catches Pharaoh-dragon in NET (Ezek 32:3) = same judgment mechanism as CAST-INTO-SEA.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **"Land of slavery"** — Isa 30:1 "go down to [slavery] for help" ✗. Why seek help FROM slavery?
2. **"Worldly provision system"** — Exod 1:14 "hard bondage in [provision]" ✗. Misses bondage.
3. **"Confinement"** (etymological only) — Isa 30:1 "go down to [confinement] for help" ✗. Doesn't explain refuge-seeking.
4. **"System of man-made security"** — Gen 47:20 ✓, Isa 30 ✓, but Exod bondage ≈. Thin on slavery.
5. **"Self-sustaining human authority"** — Ezek 29:3 ✓, Exod 5:2 ✓, but Gen 47 provision-mechanism ≈.
6. **"Confinement through provision"** (etymology + mechanism) — ALL passages ✓. Name=meaning. Provides→confines→enslaves. Exod 1 ✓, Gen 47 ✓, Isa 30 ✓ (seek the fortress), Isa 19 ✓, Rev 11:8 ✓, Ezek 29 ✓.
7. **"Babylon's bondage face"** (relational to Babylon) — ALL passages ✓. Egypt within Babylon system, specifically the enslaving mechanism. Distinguishes from Tyre (commercial), Sodom (moral). Explains why healable (face ≠ whole).

**SELECTED: #6 + #7 combined.** Egypt = confinement through provision. System enslaves through material dependence. Ruled by self-deifying authority (Pharaoh-dragon). Babylon's bondage face. Judged by plagues but healable — the PEOPLE can be redeemed even when the SYSTEM is judged.

## Pattern Summary

**Egypt's cycle:** PROVIDE → DEPEND → CONFINE → HARDEN → PLAGUE → EXTRACT
- Gen 47: provide grain → people become servants
- Exod 1-15: harden heart → plagues escalate → Israel extracted → army destroyed
- Isa 19: civil war → sorcery → drunkenness → smite AND heal
- Rev 15-16: bowl plagues replay Egypt plagues on Babylon → extraction (Rev 18:4 "come out")

**EGYPT || BABYLON || TYRE || SODOM — One system, four faces:**
- EGYPT = bondage face (enslaves through provision) — HEALABLE
- TYRE = commercial face (corrupts through trade, Ezek 27 → Rev 18) — fire from within (Ezek 28:18)
- SODOM = moral face (corrupts through indulgence) — fire from above (Gen 19:24)
- BABYLON = the whole system (self-deifying replacement of God's rule) — UNHEALABLE (Jer 51:9)

**Plague template: Exodus → Revelation mapping:**
- BLOOD: Nile (Exod 7:20) → sea+rivers (Rev 16:3-4)
- BOILS: Exod 9:9 → sores (Rev 16:2)
- HAIL+FIRE: Exod 9:24 → Rev 8:7, Rev 16:21
- DARKNESS: Exod 10:22 (3 days) → beast's kingdom (Rev 16:10)
- FROGS: Exod 8:2 → dragon/beast/false-prophet mouths (Rev 16:13)
- FIRSTBORN: Exod 12:29 → ∅ (gap — or: "Babylon is fallen" = firstborn system destroyed?)
- LOCUSTS: Exod 10:4 → Rev 9:3 (5th trumpet)

**Hardened heart = system's signature:** 13× in Exodus. Sometimes Pharaoh hardens, sometimes God hardens. System + sovereign judgment interlock. Rev 16:9,11 "repented not" = same pattern at global scale.
