## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H6865 Tsôr = "rock" (H6696 tsûr = confine/besiege). Irony: God IS the Rock (H6697); Tyre = counterfeit rock from SEA. H7404 rekullah (trade) — ALL 4 OT uses in Tyre oracle (Ezek 26:12, 28:5,16,18). THE sin-word. H7402 rakal (travel-for-trading) → H7400 rakiyl (talebearer). Trading→gossip: same root. H3667 Kenaan = "Canaan" AND "merchant" (Isa 23:8). Conquest of Canaan = displacement of merchant-system. H5526 sakak (cover/protect) = root of covering cherub (Ezek 28:14,16) AND sukkah (booth).

**A. ALLIANCE (positive):**
2Sam 5:11/1Ki 5:1 — Hiram: cedar+craftsmen for temple. Legitimate trade serving covenant.
1Ki 7:13-14 — Artisan Hiram: wisdom+craft parallel to Bezalel (Exod 31:3).
2Chr 2:14 — Every luxury material in Rev 18 catalog originally deployed FOR the temple.
1Ki 9:11-12 — PIVOT: Solomon gives 20 cities for materials. Economy begins driving covenant.
Neh 13:16 — Tyre trades IN Jerusalem ON Sabbath. Commerce violates worship-time.

**B. PROPHETIC ORACLES:**
Isa 23 — "Merchants=princes, traffickers[H3667 Kenaan]=honourable" (v8). 70yr forgotten = Babylon's 70 (v15). "Sing as HARLOT." FORNICATION with kingdoms (v17). v18 REVERSAL: merchandise→HOLINESS to LORD. Only Tyre receives redemption hint.
Ezek 26 — Tyre profits from Jerusalem's fall (v2). Nations as SEA (v3). Songs cease (→Rev 18:22). Princes sit on ground (→Rev 18:9). PIT (v20). "No more" (→Rev 18:21).
Ezek 27 — Tyre = composite SHIP from all nations (v4-11). MERCHANDISE CATALOG (→Rev 18:12-13). v13: "PERSONS OF MEN" = slave trade (→Rev 18:13 "souls of men"). v17: Judah trades with Tyre. v22-23: EDEN listed as partner. v28: H7493 EARTHQUAKE at collapse. v29-31: maritime lament (→Rev 18:17-19). v32: "What city like Tyrus?" (→Rev 18:18). v33: "Enriched kings" (→Rev 18:3).
Ezek 28:1-10 — PRINCE: "I am God, sit in seat of God" (v2) = Isa 47:8 Babylon = Rev 18:7. Chain: WISDOM→COMMERCE→RICHES→PRIDE (v5).
Ezek 28:12-19 — KING: Eden, 9 stones, anointed COVERING CHERUB (H5526 sakak). v16: "TRAFFICK[H7404]→VIOLENCE→SIN→CAST OUT." v18: "FIRE FROM MIDST OF THEE." KEY: fire originates WITHIN — self-consuming, not heaven-sent (contrast Sodom). Iniquity of traffick = fuel.
Amos 1:9-10 — Slave trade + broken brotherly covenant → fire devours.
Zech 9:2-4 — Wise, fortified, rich → smit in SEA + devoured by FIRE. Double judgment.

**C. NT:**
Matt 11:21-22 — MORE TOLERABLE for Tyre than covenant cities rejecting miracles. Tyre capable of repentance = Isa 23:18 confirmed.
Matt 15:21/Mark 7:24 — Faith found in Tyre's borders (Syro-Phoenician woman).
Acts 12:20 — Tyre nourished BY king's country. Parasitic: doesn't grow own food. → Rev 18:14.

**EZEK 27→REV 18 MAP:** Merchants weep (27:36→18:11) | "what city" (27:32→18:18) | kings from thrones (26:16→18:9) | maritime lament (27:29→18:17) | songs cease (26:13→18:22) | "never any more" (27:36→18:21) | persons/souls last in list (27:13→18:13) | luxury catalog (27:12→18:12) | fire (28:18→18:8) | self-deification (28:2→18:7) | enriched kings (27:33→18:3) | sea-casting (27:34→18:21). Rev 18 IS Ezek 27 at eschatological scale.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **COMPOSITE/GLOBAL:** Draws from all nations (Ezek 27:4-11). Connects+extracts, doesn't produce.
2. **COMMODIFIES EVERYTHING:** Offerings→goods, people→suppliers, humans→merchandise. Climax = human trafficking.
3. **SELF-DEIFYING:** "I am God" (28:2) = Babylon (Isa 47:8) = Egypt (Ezek 29:3) = Rev 18:7.
4. **CORRUPTS WITHIN:** Traffick→violence→sin (28:16). Commerce corrupts covering/protective function.
5. **SELF-CONSUMING:** Fire FROM MIDST (28:18). System's iniquity = fuel. ≠ Sodom (fire from above).
6. **TERMINAL:** "Never any more" (26:21, 27:36, 28:19, Rev 18:21). Commerce-as-idol has no afterlife.

**ANOMALY — ISA 23:18 REDEMPTION:** Commerce itself not condemned — only commerce-as-idol. Sanctified when serving covenant. Confirmed: Matt 11:21, Ps 45:12, Ps 87:4.
**ANOMALY — COVERING CHERUB:** Ezek 28:14,16 — protective function (H5526 sakak) corrupted by commerce into commodification. Coverer became trader.
