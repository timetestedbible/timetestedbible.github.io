## Etymology & Root Chain

H6865 Tsôr (צֹר) = "a rock." Same word as H6864 tsôr = "stone pressed hard/to a point; knife, flint" (Exod 4:25 Zipporah's cutting stone; Ezek 3:9 harder than flint). Root: H6696 tsûr = "cramp, confine, besiege, bind, fortify." G5184 Tyros = transliteration. Name = ROCK. Irony: God IS the Rock (H6697 tsûr, same root); Tyre is man's counterfeit rock-fortress rising from the SEA (nations).

H7404 rekullah = trade/merchandise (from H7402 rakal = "travel for trading"). 4 occurrences — ALL in Tyre oracle: Ezek 26:12, 28:5, 28:16, 28:18. This is THE sin-word. H7402 rakal also → H7400 rakiyl = "talebearer/scandal-monger" (as travelling about). Trading → gossip: same root, same itinerant corruption pattern.

H3667 Kenaan = "Canaan" AND "merchant/traffick." Isa 23:8 uses it for Tyre's "traffickers." Promised land's prior inhabitants literally = "the merchants." Conquest of Canaan = displacement of merchant-system by covenant-system.

H5526 sakak = "entwine as screen, cover, protect, hedge." Root of "covering" (H5526) cherub in Ezek 28:14,16. Also root of sukkah (H5521 = booth/tabernacle). Covering cherub's role = protection → corrupted by traffick into commodification.

## Context Bag

**A. HISTORICAL ALLIANCE — TYRE SERVES THE TEMPLE (positive):**
2Sam 5:11 / 1Ki 5:1 / 1Chr 14:1 — Hiram king of Tyre: cedar, builders, craftsmen for David's house + Solomon's temple. "Hiram was ever a lover of David." SUBJ: alliance. CO: CEDAR, BUILDERS. ROLE: legitimate trade serving covenant. CYCLE: United Kingdom.

1Ki 7:13-14 — Artisan Hiram from Tyre: "worker in brass, filled with wisdom, understanding, cunning." Parallel to Bezalel (Exod 31:3). CRAFT in service of worship.

2Chr 2:14 — Tyre artisan: skilled in gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, timber, purple, blue, fine linen, crimson. EVERY luxury material that later appears in Rev 18 catalog — originally deployed FOR the temple.

1Ki 9:11-12 — Solomon gives Hiram 20 cities for materials. PIVOT: economy begins to drive covenant arrangement rather than serve it.

Ezra 3:7 — Post-exile: Tyre provides cedar for temple restoration. Pattern persists through exile+return.

**B. COMMERCE INFILTRATES WORSHIP:**
Neh 13:16 — "Men of Tyre dwelt therein, brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold ON THE SABBATH unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem." SUBJ: Tyre trades IN Jerusalem ON Sabbath. Commerce violates worship-time. The merchant-system inside the holy city.

**C. PROPHETIC ORACLES — THE FULL TYRE PORTRAIT:**

**Isa 23:1-18** — Burden of Tyre. Ships of Tarshish howl (v1). "Mart of nations" (v3). v8: "Whose MERCHANTS are princes, whose TRAFFICKERS [H3667 Kenaan!] are the honourable of the earth." v9: "LORD purposed to stain the PRIDE of all glory." v11: "He shook the KINGDOMS" — earthquake-pattern. v13: Chaldeans (= Babylon) brought Tyre to ruin — TYRE-BABYLON explicit link. v15: 70 years forgotten "according to days of one king" (= Babylon's 70!). "Sing as a HARLOT." v17: "Commit FORNICATION with all kingdoms of the world." COMMERCE = FORNICATION. v18: REVERSAL — "her merchandise shall be HOLINESS to the LORD... for them that dwell before the LORD." Redeemed commerce serves covenant. NOTE: Only Tyre among Babylon-synonyms receives this redemption hint.

**Ezek 26:1-21** — Siege oracle. v2: Tyre's sin = profiting from Jerusalem's fall: "Aha, she is broken, I shall be replenished." v3: Nations against Tyre "as the SEA causeth his WAVES" — SEA = nations explicit. v4: Made "top of a rock" — ironic: named Rock, stripped to bare rock. v7: Nebuchadnezzar "king of kings, from the NORTH." v12: Prey of thy MERCHANDISE [H7404]. v13: "Songs cease, harps no more heard" → Rev 18:22. v15-17: "ISLES SHAKE at sound of thy fall." "Princes of the SEA come DOWN FROM THRONES, lay away robes, clothe with TREMBLING, sit upon GROUND" → Rev 18:9-10. v19: "Bring up the DEEP upon thee." v20: "Bring thee down to the PIT." v21: "Thou shalt be NO MORE" → Rev 18:21.

**Ezek 27:1-36** — LAMENTATION / THE SHIP. Tyre = composite ship built from all nations:
v3: "Merchant [H7402] of peoples for many isles." "I am of PERFECT BEAUTY."
v4-11: Ship's materials from every nation: fir from Senir, cedar from Lebanon, oaks from Bashan, ivory from Chittim, linen from Egypt, purple from Elishah, Zidon/Arvad mariners, Persia/Lud/Phut soldiers. TYRE = COMPOSITE ENTITY assembled from all nations. The globalized trade network embodied.
v12-24: MERCHANDISE CATALOG — the template for Rev 18:12-13:
- v12 Tarshish: silver, iron, tin, LEAD (→ Zech 5:7-8 lead seals wickedness).
- v13 Javan/Tubal/Meshech: "PERSONS OF MEN [H5315 nephesh + H120 adam] and vessels of brass" = SLAVE TRADE. → Rev 18:13 "slaves AND SOULS OF MEN." Climax of both catalogs = trafficking humans.
- v17 JUDAH AND ISRAEL: wheat, honey, oil, balm. Covenant people trading commodity-offerings with Tyre.
- v21 Arabia: lambs, rams, goats — what should be OFFERINGS now commodified.
- v22-23 Sheba/Raamah/Haran/Canneh/EDEN: spices, stones, gold. NOTE: "Eden" listed as Tyre trading partner = Ezek 28:13 connection.
v25: "Ships of Tarshish did sing of thee" — maritime celebration.
v26-27: "EAST WIND hath broken thee in midst of seas." "ALL... shall FALL into midst of seas in the day of thy RUIN."
v28: "SUBURBS SHALL SHAKE [H7493 ra'ash]" = EARTHQUAKE at commercial collapse.
v29-31: Mariners "come down from ships, stand upon land, cry bitterly, cast DUST on heads, wallow in ASHES, gird with SACKCLOTH, weep" → Rev 18:17-19 exact scene.
v32: "WHAT CITY IS LIKE TYRUS?" → Rev 18:18 "What city is like unto this great city!"
v33: "Thou didst ENRICH THE KINGS of the earth" → Rev 18:3 "merchants waxed rich."
v36: "MERCHANTS hiss; thou shalt be a TERROR, and NEVER shalt be ANY MORE" → Rev 18:11,21.

**Ezek 28:1-19** — PRINCE → KING. Two-layer oracle, surface → depth:

PRINCE [H5057 nagiyd] of Tyrus (vv2-10):
v2: "I AM A GOD, I sit in the SEAT OF GOD, in the MIDST OF THE SEAS; yet thou art a MAN, and not God, though thou set thine HEART as the heart of God." SELF-DEIFICATION triple: = Isa 47:8 Babylon "I am, none else" = Ezek 29:3 Egypt "my river is mine" = Rev 18:7 "I sit a queen." Three faces of same claim.
v5: "By thy great WISDOM and by thy TRAFFICK [H7404] hast thou INCREASED thy riches, and thine HEART is lifted up because of thy riches." Chain: WISDOM → COMMERCE → RICHES → PRIDE.
v8: "Bring thee down to the PIT, die the deaths of them slain in midst of the SEAS."

KING [H4428 melek] of Tyrus (vv12-19) — deeper reality:
v12: "Thou sealest up the SUM [H8508 toknith = pattern/consummation], full of WISDOM, and PERFECT in BEAUTY."
v13: "Thou hast been in EDEN the garden of God." Every precious stone was thy COVERING: sardius, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, carbuncle, GOLD. 9 stones (priestly breastplate = 12). "Tabrets and pipes prepared in thee in the day thou wast CREATED."
v14: "Thou art the ANOINTED CHERUB that COVERETH [H5526 sakak]." "Upon the holy MOUNTAIN of God." "Walked up and down in the midst of the STONES OF FIRE."
v15: "PERFECT in thy ways from the day thou wast CREATED, till INIQUITY was found in thee."
v16: "By the multitude of thy MERCHANDISE [H7404] they have filled the MIDST of thee with VIOLENCE [H2555 chamas], and thou hast SINNED: therefore I will cast thee as PROFANE out of the MOUNTAIN of God: and I will DESTROY thee, O COVERING CHERUB, from the midst of the stones of fire." TRAFFICK → VIOLENCE → SIN → CAST OUT. Commerce is the mechanism of the fall.
v17: "HEART lifted up because of BEAUTY, CORRUPTED thy WISDOM by reason of thy BRIGHTNESS."
v18: "Thou hast DEFILED thy SANCTUARIES by the multitude of thine INIQUITIES, by the INIQUITY OF THY TRAFFICK [H7404]; therefore will I bring forth a FIRE FROM THE MIDST OF THEE, it shall DEVOUR thee, and I will bring thee to ASHES upon the earth." KEY: Fire originates WITHIN. Not fire from heaven (Sodom), not fire from God's altar (theophany). Self-consuming judgment. = Isa 9:18 wickedness burns as fire. The system's own commerce/violence becomes its fuel.
v19: "Thou shalt be a TERROR, and NEVER shalt thou be ANY MORE."

**Ezek 28:24** — Resolution: "No more a pricking BRIER unto the house of Israel, nor any grieving THORN." Tyre/Zidon = THORNS around Israel. CO: THORNS = Babylon's population (Luke 8:14 "cares, riches, pleasures").
**Ezek 28:25-26** — "When I have GATHERED Israel... dwell SAFELY... build houses... plant vineyards." Opposite of Tyre: covenant-people produce rather than trade.

**Ezek 29:18** — Nebuchadnezzar served against Tyrus but got NO WAGES. Babylon-as-instrument used against Tyre but not rewarded for it. Tools of judgment are themselves judged.

**Amos 1:9-10** — SINS: (1) "Delivered up the WHOLE CAPTIVITY to Edom" = slave trade. (2) "Remembered not the BROTHERLY COVENANT" = broken covenant. Judgment: "FIRE on the wall of Tyrus, devour palaces." Commerce → enslavement + covenant betrayal.

**Zech 9:2-4** — "Very WISE." Built "STRONG HOLD." "Heaped up SILVER as dust, fine GOLD as mire." v4: "The Lord will cast her out, SMITE HER POWER IN THE SEA; she shall be devoured with FIRE." Double judgment: sea + fire. CO: WISDOM, FORTRESS, SILVER, GOLD, SEA, FIRE.

**Hos 9:13** — "EPHRAIM, as I saw Tyrus, planted in pleasant place." Tyre-pattern applied to Israel. CO: internal corruption pattern.

**Joel 3:4** — "Swiftly and speedily will I RETURN your recompence upon your OWN HEAD." Self-return pattern = Ezek 28:18 fire from within.

**D. NT OCCURRENCES:**
Matt 11:21-22 / Luke 10:13-14 — "More tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you." TYRE MORE RESPONSIVE to God's works than covenant cities. Tyre capable of repentance (sackcloth/ashes) = Isa 23:18 redemption hint confirmed.

Matt 15:21 / Mark 7:24,31 — Jesus enters Tyre/Sidon borders. Syro-Phoenician woman = faith found in merchant-nation territory.

Acts 12:20 — "Herod displeased with Tyre/Sidon... desired peace; because their country was NOURISHED BY THE KING'S COUNTRY." Commerce-city dependent on producing-nation for food. PARASITIC system that doesn't grow its own sustenance. = Rev 18:14 "fruits departed."

Acts 21:3 — Paul at Tyre; ship UNLADES BURDEN. Commerce continues as background fact.

## Pattern Summary

**TYRE = COMMERCE AS SYSTEM.** Not trade itself but trade as organizing principle — when buying/selling replaces covenant as the bond between peoples. Consistently operates through 6 elements:

1. **COMPOSITE/GLOBAL** — draws materials, people, crafts from all nations (Ezek 27:4-11). The first globalized network. Tyre doesn't produce; it CONNECTS and EXTRACTS.

2. **COMMODIFIES EVERYTHING** — offerings become goods (v21 lambs/rams), covenant people become suppliers (v17 Judah trades wheat), humans become merchandise (v13 persons of men → Rev 18:13 souls of men). The climax of both catalogs = human trafficking. Commerce dehumanizes.

3. **SELF-DEIFYING** — "I am a God" (28:2), "I am of perfect beauty" (27:3). Same claim as Babylon (Isa 47:8) and Egypt (Ezek 29:3). Commerce generates the illusion of divine self-sufficiency.

4. **CORRUPTS FROM WITHIN** — traffick fills the midst with VIOLENCE (28:16). Commerce → violence → sin → profanation. The mechanism: trade corrupts the covering/protective function. The cherub that was supposed to protect instead commodifies.

5. **SELF-CONSUMING** — "fire FROM THE MIDST of thee" (28:18). Not external judgment but auto-generated destruction. The system's own iniquity becomes fuel. = Isa 9:18 wickedness burns as fire. Joel 3:4 "return recompence upon your own head."

6. **NEVER ANY MORE** — Ezek 26:21, 27:36, 28:19, Rev 18:21. Terminal. Unlike Egypt (Isa 19:25 "blessed be Egypt my people"), the commerce-system-as-replacement-for-covenant has no afterlife.

**EZEK 27 → REV 18 QUOTATION MAP:**

| Thrown into sea/deep | 26:19, 27:34 | 18:21 millstone into sea |
| Fornication with kingdoms | Isa 23:17 | 18:3,9 |

Rev 18 IS Ezek 27 at eschatological scale. John's Babylon = Ezekiel's Tyre universalized.

**KEY ANOMALY — ISA 23:18 REDEMPTION:** "Her merchandise shall be holiness to the LORD." Commerce itself is not condemned — only commerce-as-idol. The system can be sanctified when it SERVES covenant ("for them that dwell before the LORD"). Confirmed by NT: Tyre more tolerable than Chorazin (Matt 11:21). Faith found in Tyre's borders (Matt 15:21-28). Ps 45:12 "daughter of Tyre with a gift" at messianic wedding. Ps 87:4 Tyre listed among those who know God. The merchant-nation CAN convert.

**KEY ANOMALY — COVERING CHERUB:** Ezek 28:14,16 — anointed cherub in Eden, holy mountain, stones of fire. Whether literal angelic being or typological role, the MECHANISM is the same: a covering/protective function (H5526 sakak → sukkah/tabernacle/booth) corrupted by commerce into commodification. The one who was supposed to protect the sacred space instead traded it.
