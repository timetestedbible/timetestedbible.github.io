## Context Bag

STUB — needs full study.

Key connections to BABYLON already identified:
- Self-deifying ruler: Ezek 28:2 "I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas" = Babylon's "I am, none else" = Egypt's "my river is mine"
- Ezek 28:12-18: King of Tyre = "in Eden the garden of God," "anointed cherub," corrupted by "traffick" (H7404 rekullah = commerce). COMMERCE is the specific sin.
- Ezek 28:18: "I will bring forth a FIRE FROM THE MIDST OF THEE, it shall devour thee" — fire originates WITHIN the system. Self-consuming judgment. = Isa 9:18 wickedness burns as fire.
- Ezek 27 = TEMPLATE for Rev 18. Shared elements: luxury merchandise catalog, ships of Tarshish, merchants weeping, "what city is like this city?" (Ezek 27:32 = Rev 18:18), maritime collapse, "never shalt be any more" (Ezek 27:36 = Rev 18:21).
- Ezek 26:15-17: "princes of the sea come down from thrones... tremble" = Rev 18:9-10 kings bewail from afar.
- Ezek 27:12-13: Trade includes silver, iron, tin, LEAD, and "persons of men" (slave trade) = Rev 18:13 "slaves, and souls of men."
- Ezek 27:28: "suburbs shall shake (H7493 ra'ash)" = EARTHQUAKE/SEISMOS = systemic shaking at commercial collapse.

QUEUE: Full symbol-study needed. Map Ezek 26-28 → Rev 17-18 quotation chains exhaustively. Note: Ezek 28:14 "stones of fire" needs investigation.
