## Context Bag

### Hebrew: H1060 bᵉkôwr
From H1069 (bakar). "Firstborn; hence, chief." ~96 OT occurrences. Feminine form H1062 bᵉkôwrâh = "birthright, primogeniture" (~15 occ). Root shared with H1061 bikkuwr = "firstfruits" — firstborn among humans parallels firstfruits among crops.

### Greek: G4416 prōtotokos
From G4413 (prōtos = first) + G5088 (tiktō = to bear). "First-born, literally or figuratively." 9 NT occurrences. Applied exclusively to Christ or to the redeemed community.

### Key Occurrences

**National firstborn**: Exo4:22 — "Israel is my son, my firstborn." God's claim on an entire nation as covenant heir. Paired immediately with threat: Exo4:23 — refuse to release my firstborn → I slay YOUR firstborn. Firstborn-for-firstborn exchange established before plagues begin.

**Plague on firstborn**: Exo11:5, 12:12, 12:29 — death of ALL firstborn in Egypt, from Pharaoh's throne to dungeon captive to cattle. Num33:4 — "upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments." Firstborn death = judgment on an entire system (Egypt's gods). Scope: Psa78:51 "chief of their strength" (H7225 = beginning/firstfruits); Psa105:36, 135:8, 136:10 — Psalms repeatedly memorialize this as THE defining act of redemption.

**Consecration law**: Exo13:2 — "Sanctify unto me ALL the firstborn… it is mine." Exo13:13 — firstborn of man REDEEMED; firstborn of clean animal sacrificed. Num3:12-13 — Levites substituted for all Israel's firstborn. Pattern: firstborn must be either redeemed or given to God. No neutral option.

**Birthright transferable**: Gen25:31-34 — Esau sells birthright (H1062) for bread + lentils. "Thus Esau despised his birthright." Gen27:36 — "he took away my birthright AND my blessing." 1Ch5:1-2 — Reuben was firstborn but birthright given to Joseph's sons (defilement); yet Judah prevailed for ruler. Pattern: natural firstborn ≠ covenant firstborn. God repeatedly bypasses natural order: Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Ephraim over Manasseh (Gen48:14-18), David over elder brothers (1Ch2:13+).

**Messianic firstborn**: Psa89:27 — "I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth." Decree: firstborn = supreme authority, not merely birth order. Jer31:9 — "Ephraim is my firstborn" — God reassigns firstborn status by covenant choice.

**Christ as firstborn**: Col1:15 — "firstborn of every creature" (preeminence over all creation). Col1:18 — "firstborn from the dead" (first to conquer death permanently). Rom8:29 — believers "conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren." Heb1:6 — "when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world… let all angels worship him." Rev1:5 — "first begotten of the dead, and prince of the kings of the earth."

**Church as firstborn assembly**: Heb12:23 — "church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven." Plural: the entire redeemed community shares firstborn status through Christ. Connects to Exo4:22 (Israel = corporate firstborn) but now extended to all who are in Christ.

**Passover + firstborn**: Heb11:28 — "through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them." BLOOD protects firstborn from death. Lamb dies so firstborn lives — substitutionary pattern.

**Sacrifice of firstborn (counterfeit)**: 2Ki3:27 — Moab's king sacrifices eldest son on wall. Mic6:7 — "shall I give my firstborn for my transgression?" — rhetorical: God does NOT require human firstborn sacrifice (unlike pagan systems). Yet God DOES give His own firstborn (Col1:15 + Joh3:16).

**Jericho curse**: Jos6:26, 1Ki16:34 — rebuilding Jericho costs firstborn (foundation) and youngest (gates). Firstborn = price of disobedience against God's devoted-destruction decree.

### Pattern Summary

FIRSTBORN = covenant heir who holds authority, receives double portion, and belongs to God. The pattern runs on four tracks: (1) **Natural firstborn bypassed** — God chooses the younger, transfers birthright by covenant not birth; (2) **Firstborn redeemed by blood** — Passover lamb substitutes, Levites substitute, always a cost; (3) **Firstborn as judgment target** — Egypt's firstborn die because Pharaoh holds God's firstborn captive; (4) **Christ fulfills all tracks** — firstborn of creation, firstborn from death, the Lamb who IS the firstborn and redeems the firstborn simultaneously. Heb12:23 closes the loop: believers become "church of the firstborn" — the birthright Esau despised, the inheritance Reuben lost, restored through the blood of the true Firstborn.

Substitution test: "firstborn of every creature" → "covenant heir of every creature" ✓ | "firstborn from the dead" → "covenant heir risen from the dead" ✓ | "church of the firstborn" → "church of the covenant heirs" ✓ | Psa89:27 "make him my firstborn, higher than kings" → "make him my covenant heir, supreme over kings" ✓ | Gen25:34 "Esau despised his birthright" → "Esau despised his covenant inheritance" ✓
