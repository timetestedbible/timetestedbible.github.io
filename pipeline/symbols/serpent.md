**H5175 nachash** = "a snake (from its hiss)" from H5172 nachash = "to hiss, whisper, practice divination, observe signs." Root = enchantment/divination, NOT merely "snake." The creature embodies the METHOD — whispered suggestion, sign-reading, divination. G3789 ophis = "a snake; figuratively an artful malicious person, esp. Satan" from G3700 optanomai (to gaze/see) — sharpness of vision = cunning perception.

## Context Bag

Gen 3:1-4 — subj: H5175 MORE SUBTLE (H6175 arum = crafty/shrewd) than any beast. SPEAKS to woman. Method: questions God's word, contradicts it. co: DECEIVE, WOMAN, TREE. NOT identified as Satan in text — that link comes Rev 12:9.
Gen 3:13-15 — subj: serpent BEGUILED (H5377 nasha = deceive/lead astray). CURSED above all animals → belly → eat DUST (H6083). Seed-enmity: her seed bruises HEAD, serpent bruises HEEL. co: CURSE, DUST, WOMAN. Protoevangelium. Dust = mortality/humiliation.
Gen 49:17 — subj: DAN = serpent by the WAY, adder in path, bites horse heels → rider falls. co: WAY, DAN. Tribe-serpent connection. Same HEEL-biting pattern as Gen 3:15.
Exod 4:3 — subj: Moses' rod → H5175 nachash. Before ISRAEL = nachash (personal sign). cf. Exod 7:9-12 before Pharaoh = H8577 tanniyn (empire sign). Two different words, two different scales.
Num 21:6-9 — subj: fiery (H8314 saraph) serpents (H5175) sent as judgment. Bronze (H5178 nechosheth) serpent on POLE (H5251 nes = standard/banner). Look → live. co: BRONZE_BRASS, FIRE. Bronze shares root with nachash (H5178/H5175). The CURE images the CURSE — lifted serpent = judged sin made visible.
Jn 3:14 — subj: "As Moses lifted serpent (G3789), so must Son of man be lifted up." Direct typology: bronze serpent = crucified Christ. Sin-bearer images sin itself. co: BRONZE_BRASS.
2Ki 18:4 — subj: Hezekiah BROKE bronze serpent — Israel burned incense to it. Named Nehushtan (H5180 from H5178). Remedy became idol. Pattern: God's provision → man's worship-object.
Deut 8:15 — subj: wilderness = fiery serpents + scorpions + drought. co: SCORPION, FIRE. Wilderness trials.
Isa 14:29 — subj: from serpent's ROOT comes cockatrice, fruit = fiery flying serpent. Escalation: nachash → saraph. co: FIRE.
Isa 27:1 — subj: LORD punishes leviathan the PIERCING nachash + CROOKED nachash + slays tanniyn in sea. THREE terms = one entity at end. co: DRAGON, SEA, SWORD.
Isa 65:25 — subj: DUST = serpent's FOOD in the restored kingdom. Serpent still exists but reduced to dust-eating. NOT destroyed — defanged.
Jer 8:17 — subj: God sends serpents + cockatrices as judgment. Jer 46:22 — Egypt's voice goes like serpent (fleeing/hissing). co: EGYPT.
Amos 5:19 — subj: flee lion → meet bear → enter house → serpent bites. INESCAPABLE judgment. Three stages: lion (empire), bear (empire), serpent (personal). co: LION, BEAR.
Amos 9:3 — subj: hide in sea bottom → God commands THE serpent to bite. Serpent as divine judgment-agent even in depths. co: SEA.
Mic 7:17 — subj: nations lick DUST like serpent. Enemies reduced to serpent's posture. Reversal of Gen 3:14.
Mat 10:16 — subj: "wise (G5429 phronimos) as serpents, harmless as doves." POSITIVE attribute of serpent = shrewdness/perception. Dual nature: cunning can serve God or Satan.
Mat 23:33 — subj: Pharisees = serpents, generation of VIPERS. co: DECEIVE. Religious leaders as serpent-brood.
Lk 10:19 — subj: authority to tread on serpents + scorpions + ALL power of enemy. co: SCORPION. Serpent+scorpion = full demonic arsenal.
2Cor 11:3 — subj: serpent BEGUILED (G1818 exapatao) Eve through SUBTILTY (G3834 panourgia = craftiness). Paul fears same for church. METHOD = mental corruption from simplicity. co: DECEIVE, WOMAN.
Rev 9:19 — subj: tails like serpents with heads, doing hurt. co: SCORPION. Serpent-tail = deceptive rear-attack.
Rev 12:9 — subj: EXPLICIT: great dragon = OLD (G744 archaios) serpent = Devil = Satan = world-deceiver. Fourfold ID. nachash of Gen 3 = dragon of empires = same being.
Rev 12:14-15 — subj: serpent casts WATER (flood) from mouth after woman. Woman given EAGLE wings to flee. co: DRAGON, WOMAN, EAGLE, SEA.
Rev 20:2 — subj: bound the dragon, that OLD serpent = Devil = Satan. 1000yr binding. Repeats Rev 12:9 ID.

**CANDIDATES TESTED**: (1) Satan → works in ALL contexts but is explicit only in Rev. (2) Deception/cunning → Gen 3:1 arum, 2Cor 11:3 panourgia, Mat 10:16 phronimos — consistent. (3) Divination/enchantment → H5172 root supports, but doesn't work in Num 21 or Jn 3:14. (4) Curse/judgment agent → Num 21:6, Jer 8:17, Amos 9:3, but doesn't work in Mat 10:16 (positive). (5) Speech/whispered suggestion → hiss-root, Gen 3 dialogue, Eccl 10:11 "without enchantment" — strong but narrow. (6) Wisdom perverted → arum/phronimos, works in positive+negative uses. (7) Anti-Word → serpent speaks AGAINST God's word (Gen 3:1,4); Christ IS the Word lifted up (Jn 3:14). Best: the deceiver operating through cunning speech at the personal level. Substitution test: Gen 3 ✓, Num 21 ✓ (judgment BY the deceiver, cure BY imaging it), Jn 3:14 ✓ (sin-bearer images the deceiver's work), Mat 10:16 ✓ (use the deceiver's method — perception — for good), Rev 12:9 ✓.

**PATTERNS**: (1) SERPENT ≠ DRAGON: nachash (H5175) = personal-scale cunning; tanniyn (H8577) = empire-scale power. Rev 12:9 MERGES them into one identity. (2) DUST CHAIN: Gen 3:14 eat dust → Gen 3:19 man = dust → Mic 7:17 enemies lick dust → Isa 65:25 serpent's food = dust. Serpent feeds on fallen humanity. (3) BRONZE PARADOX: cure images curse. H5178 nechosheth (bronze) shares root with H5175 nachash. Bronze serpent = judgment made visible → looking = faith → life. Jn 3:14 completes: lifted Christ = lifted serpent. (4) THREE-LEVEL ESCALATION: nachash → saraph (fiery) → tanniyn (dragon). Personal → intensified → empire. Isa 14:29 traces this escalation. (5) SERPENT+SCORPION: paired in Deut 8:15, Lk 10:19, Rev 9:19. Both sting; serpent = deception, scorpion = torment. Full demonic toolkit.
