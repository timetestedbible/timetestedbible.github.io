## Context Bag

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**

**2Chr 15:6** — DEFINING. God smashed nation(H1471) w/ nation, city w/ city, "for God troubled them with all adversity." Asa's era. Speaker=Azariah prophet. SUBJECT=covenant unfaithfulness producing internal fracture. ROLE=descriptor of judgment. CO-OCC=no peace (anti-HIGHWAY). CYCLE=Kingdom. God is AGENT of fracturing—not foreign invasion but internal dissolution.

**Isa 19:2** — Egypt oracle. "I will set Egyptians against Egyptians; kingdom against kingdom." SUBJECT=judgment on Egypt. ROLE=descriptor. CO-OCC=spirit of confusion(WIND), idols(IDOLATRY), DARKNESS(counsel fails). HEADER="burden of Egypt." Speaker=YHWH. CYCLE=Kingdom/Assyria. Internal civil war as divine judgment. City vs city pattern repeats 2Chr 15:6.

**Isa 9:19-21** — Manasseh vs Ephraim, both against Judah. "No man shall spare his brother." SUBJECT=covenant Israel consuming itself. CO-OCC=FIRE, DARKNESS, WICKEDNESS burns. CYCLE=Kingdom. Internal tribal warfare = covenant curse (Lev 26:17,25).

**Hag 2:22** — "I will overthrow kingdoms…every one by sword of his brother." SUBJECT=shaking nations to establish Zerubbabel/messianic figure. CO-OCC=EARTHQUAKE("shake heavens/earth"), MOUNTAIN(thrones/kingdoms overthrown). CYCLE=Return. God orchestrates mutual destruction of kingdoms.

**Matt 24:7 / Mark 13:8 / Luke 21:10** — Olivet Discourse. Ethnos(G1484) vs ethnos, basileia vs basileia. SUBJECT=signs preceding temple destruction/end. ROLE=subject, first-listed birth-pain sign. CO-OCC=BIRTH_PAINS(explicit "beginning of sorrows"), FAMINE, PESTILENCE, EARTHQUAKE. Speaker=Yeshua. CYCLE=Rome. CONTEXT=apocalyptic discourse. NOTE: "ethnos" = LXX standard translation of H1471(goy). Jesus quotes/echoes 2Chr 15:6 + Isa 19:2 pattern exactly—"nation against nation, kingdom against kingdom" is verbatim formula.

**CLUSTER:** All occurrences cluster around ONE subject: **divine discipline producing internal fracture among peoples**. Not foreign conquest—SELF-destruction. God sets brother against brother as covenant curse (cf. Lev 26:17, Deut 28:25 inverse).

**CONSISTENT READING:** Nation-against-nation = covenant order fragmenting under God's hand. Peoples who should be unified (Egypt internally, Israel's tribes, kingdoms generally) turn on each other. This is SIGN not cause—sign that God is actively judging. In Olivet Discourse, it's first birth-pain: covenant community fractures BEFORE greater judgments (famine, earthquake, persecution).

**ANOMALIES:** None significant. All occurrences follow same pattern.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H1471 goy → LXX ethnos (G1484). 2Chr 15:6 LXX: ethnos vs ethnos—Jesus in Matt 24:7 uses identical Greek phrasing. Direct literary allusion. NT audience would hear Azariah's warning: God Himself is the troubler.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H1471 goy = non-covenant peoples OR Israel-as-nation (Gen 12:2). G1484 ethnos carries same dual sense. The ambiguity is the point: covenant people BECOME like goyim when fractured—losing covenant unity makes them indistinguishable from pagan nations at war.

**OPPOSITE:** HIGHWAY—peoples streaming together to Zion in unity (Isa 2:2-4, "nation shall not lift sword against nation"). Perfect inversion.
