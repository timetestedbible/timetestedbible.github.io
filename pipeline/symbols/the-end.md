## Context Bag

**H7093 (qets):** BDB: "end, limit of time/space." From H7112 (qatsats=cut off). Semantic domain: cutting, termination, boundary. LXX renders → G4930 (synteleia=consummation), G5056 (telos), G2078 (eschatos). Key: cutting implies covenant-cutting; end = covenant completion point.

**G5056 (telos):** "The point aimed at as a limit" — GOAL, completion, revenue/tax, outcome. NOT cessation, NOT "the tribulation," NOT "the end of the world." Telos = the PURPOSE ARRIVING. Rom 10:4 "Christ is the telos of the Torah" = Christ is the GOAL of Torah, not its abolition. 1Tim 1:5 "the telos of the commandment is love" = love is the PURPOSE of the commandment. Mat 24:14 "then shall the telos come" = then shall the PURPOSE/GOAL arrive — the completion of testimony achieves the covenant purpose. Mat 24:6 "the telos is not yet" = the goal hasn't arrived yet — wars/rumors are NOT the goal.

**DISTINCT "END" WORDS — do NOT collapse:**
- **G5056 telos** = goal, purpose, completion, outcome. POSITIVE: the aimed-at thing arrives.
- **G4930 synteleia** = joint-completion, consummation. Mat 24:3 disciples ask "what is the sign of the synteleia of the age?" = the CONSUMMATION of the age-process, not mere stoppage. From G4931 synteleo = complete together.
- **G2078 eschatos** = last, uttermost, extreme. Rev 1:17 "I am the first and the eschatos." Temporal extremity.
- **G4009 peras** = extremity, limit, boundary. Rom 10:18 "their words unto the peras of the world." Geographic limit.
- **H7093 qets** = cut, boundary, termination. From H7112 qatsats = cut off. The CUTTING point — covenant-cutting emphasis.
- **H319 achariyth** = latter end, aftermath, posterity, future. Jer 29:11 "give you an achariyth and a hope." Even the ending has a FUTURE.
- **H8503 takliyth** = completeness, perfection, purpose. Job 26:10 "until the takliyth of light with darkness." The completion-point.

These are NOT synonyms. Telos = purpose arriving. Qets = cutting point. Synteleia = consummation process. Achariyth = what comes after. Collapsing them into one "the end = tribulation" loses the meaning. When Jesus says "the telos is not yet" (Mat 24:6) he means "the PURPOSE hasn't arrived yet" — not "the tribulation hasn't started yet."

**OCCURRENCE CLUSTERS:**

**Daniel cluster (H7093):** Dan 8:17,19 — "time of the end" = appointed covenant judgment time. Dan 9:26 — "end like a flood" after Messiah cut off; co-occurs WARS, desolations=FAMINE. Dan 11:35,40 — "time of the end" = purifying/refining. Dan 12:4,9,13 — sealed till end; Daniel stands in his lot "at the end." SUBJECT: covenant timetable reaching appointed goal.

**Olivet Discourse (G5056):** Matt 24:6 "not yet the end" — WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS, NATION AGAINST NATION co-occur but are NOT the end. Matt 24:13-14 "endures to end saved; gospel preached then THE END comes" — FAITH(endurance) + KINGDOM preaching → then telos. End = covenant purpose fulfilled when testimony complete. Co-occurs: DECEIVE, WICKEDNESS, FAMINE, EARTHQUAKE, BIRTH PAINS.

**Epistles (G5056):** 1Cor 10:11 "ends of ages reached us" — Exodus typology fulfilled. 1Pet 4:7 "end of all things at hand" — linked to judgment beginning at God's house=covenant accountability. Rom 10:4 "Christ is telos of Torah" — goal/fulfillment, NOT abolition. 1Tim 1:5 "telos of commandment is love" — purpose/goal. Heb 6:8 "end is burning" — THORNS, covenant land metaphor.

**Psalms/Wisdom:** Ps 73:17 "understood their end" — outcome of wicked = covenant judgment. Prov 14:12 "end thereof = ways of death" — WAY + END = outcome of chosen path. Ps 119:96 "end of all perfection" = Torah is boundless (no telos to God's commands).

**Prophets (H7093):** Ezek 7:2-6 "the end has come upon four corners" — LAND judgment. Amos 8:2 "end has come upon my people Israel" — FAMINE of word co-occurs. Jer 51:13 "end has come, measure of covetousness" — BABYLON.

**CONSISTENT READING:** THE END = covenant purpose reaching fulfillment/consummation. Not mere stopping but GOAL-ARRIVAL. In judgment contexts: covenant terms fully executed. In salvation contexts: covenant promises fully realized. Always tied to appointed divine timetable, not random cessation.

**ANOMALIES:** Tax/tribute usage (Matt 17:25 telos=revenue) — even here: obligation fulfilled. Job 6:11 "what is my end?" — personal covenant-purpose question. These confirm telos=purposeful outcome, not mere termination.

**TELEO/TELOS CHAIN — "FINISHED → THEN THE END."** G5055 teleo (to finish/complete) derives from G5056 telos (end/goal). Four passages use the same structure: (1) Mat 24:14 — gospel preached for a marturion → "then (tote) the telos comes." (2) Rev 11:7 — "when they telesōsin (G5055) their marturian" → beast acts → 7th trumpet. (3) Rev 10:7 — "mystery of God telesthē (G5055), as he declared to his servants the prophets." (4) 1Cor 15:24 — "then (eita) the telos, when he delivers the kingdom." ALL describe: testimony/mystery completion → telos arrives → kingdom transferred. The finishing (teleo) of the witness IS the trigger for the end (telos). The 7th trumpet (Rev 11:15) is the anchor: "kingdoms become the Lord's" = 1Cor 15:24 "delivers the kingdom" = Dan 7:14 "given him dominion." TRUMPET is the symbol that marks telos: "at the LAST trump" (1Cor 15:52) = the 7th trumpet = the telos.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7093(qets/cut) → LXX synteleia(joint-completion) → NT telos(goal). Hebrew emphasizes cutting=covenant-making; Greek emphasizes fulfillment. Both: appointed covenant boundary reached. Dan 9:26 LXX uses synteleia; Matt 24:3 disciples ask about synteleia; Matt 24:6,14 Jesus answers with telos. Synteleia=the process; telos=the achieved goal.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H7093 from "cut" visible only in Hebrew — connects to covenant-cutting (H3772 karath). Greek telos invisible connection to teleios(perfect/mature) — end=maturity of covenant purpose.
