## Context Bag

**EXPLICIT DEF:** Prov 6:23 — "the commandment IS a lamp; the law IS light" → direct equation: LAMP=COMMANDMENT, LIGHT=LAW. Ps 119:105 — "thy word is a lamp unto my feet" confirms WORD/INSTRUCTION → LAMP.

**PRODUCTION CHAIN:** LAMP(commandment) + OIL(proven works) = LIGHT(visible example). Without OIL the LAMP produces no LIGHT. || James 2:17 "faith without works is dead."

**PARABLE — Ten VIRGINS (Matt 25:1-13):** 10 VIRGINS = covenant people awaiting bridegroom. LAMPS = commandments. OIL = proven works. WISE (Matt 25:4) had lamps+oil → commandments+works → obedient. FOOLISH (Matt 25:3) had lamps, no oil → commandments, no works → disobedient. Matt 25:8 "our lamps are gone out" → commandments produce no LIGHT without works. subj: hearing vs doing.

**TABERNACLE:** Golden lampstand (menorah) — seven lamps (Exod 25:37) = complete illumination. Pure beaten olive OIL (Exod 27:20, Lev 24:2) = proven/pressed works. Burn continually (Exod 27:20, Lev 24:2) = perpetual example. Before the LORD (Lev 24:4) = visible to God. Priests responsible to keep lamps burning → continual obedient action required.

**ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE:** 2 Sam 22:29 — "thou art my lamp, O LORD" → the LORD's instruction/standard = LAMP that illuminates DARKNESS. Prov 13:9 — "lamp of the wicked shall be put out" → wicked claim commandments but no OIL (no obedience) → no LIGHT. Prov 20:20 — cursing parents (breaking commandment) → lamp put out in obscure DARKNESS → disobedience extinguishes. 2 Chr 21:7 — "lamp" (H5216 ner) given to David = continuing covenant/commandment preserved for his sons.

**HEBREW/GREEK:** H5216 נֵר (ner) = lamp/light/candle [Prov 6:23, Ps 119:105]. H3940 לַפִּיד (lappid) = torch/firebrand [Gen 15:17, Judg 7:16]. G2985 λαμπάς (lampas) = lamp/torch [Matt 25:1-8].

**SYMBOL WEB:** LAMP → TRUTH (both = commandment, different metaphor). LAMP produces → LIGHT (visible example). OIL fuels → LAMP. WISE = obedient (lamp+oil). FOOL = disobedient (lamp, no oil). DARKNESS = opposite (absence of commandment). VIRGIN + LAMP + OIL in Matt 25 parable.

**SUBSTITUTION TEST:** Prov 6:23 ✓ (direct def). Ps 119:105 "thy word is a commandment unto my feet" ✓. Matt 25:3 "took their commandments, took no works" ✓. Matt 25:8 "our commandments produce no light" ✓. Prov 13:9 "commandment of the wicked produces no light" ✓. 2 Sam 22:29 "thou art my instruction, O LORD" ✓.

**CONFIDENCE: HIGH** — explicitly defined (Prov 6:23), confirmed (Ps 119:105), coherent production chain, explains Matt 25 parable, consistent with symbol web.
