**PATTERNS:**
• Overwhelmingly prophetic judgment contexts
• Always: existing order broken → new emerges  
• Pain = transitional ≠ terminal
• Covenant judgment producing new covenant order
• Precedes deliverance/birth of new thing

**ANOMALIES:**
Isa 42:14 — YHWH Himself travails (unique)
Acts 2:24 — Death's pangs loosed = resurrection reframes death as failed labor

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H2256→LXX ὠδίν→NT ὠδίν (G5604). Matt 24:8 echoes OT prophetic pattern.

**HEBREW:** H2256 *chebel* cord+pain links covenant binding to labor. Judgment = covenant cord tightening.
