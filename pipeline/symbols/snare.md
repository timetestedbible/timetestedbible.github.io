## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H4170 moqesh — from H3369 yaqosh (to ensnare); a noose/hook. ~27× OT. H6341 pach — from H6351 pachach (to spread flat); metallic sheet pounded thin → spring-net spread like a lamina = CONCEALED flat trap. ~25× OT (some = literal metal plates: Exo 39:3, Num 16:38). H3369 yaqosh — primitive root: to ensnare. → H3352/H3353 yaqosh/yaqush = fowler/snarer. G3803 pagis — from G4078 pegnymi (to fasten/fix); trap fastened by noose/notch. 5× NT. Two Hebrew nouns = two trap types: moqesh = NOOSE (tightens), pach = SPRING-NET (collapses). Both = concealed, triggered, irreversible.

**LAW/NARRATIVE:**
Exo 23:33, 34:12, Deut 7:16 — idolatrous nations in land = moqesh. COHABITATION with condemned → entrapment. 3× Torah.
Judg 2:3, 8:27 — fulfilled: nations' gods + Gideon's ephod = moqesh. IDOLATRY = trigger.
1Sam 18:21 — Saul uses daughter as moqesh for David. Relationship weaponized.
Ps 106:36 — idols = moqesh. Law principle confirmed in history.

**PSALMS (DELIVERANCE):**
Ps 91:3 — pach of fowler. co: PESTILENCE. God delivers from concealed trap.
Ps 124:7 — soul escaped as BIRD from pach; snare BROKEN (H7665). Escape = trap destroyed, not merely evaded.
Ps 18:5 / 2Sam 22:6 — moqesh of DEATH surrounded me. co: SHEOL. Death has a snare-mechanism.
Ps 11:6 — God RAINS pach on wicked + FIRE + brimstone. Trap-mechanism turned on trappers.
Ps 69:22 — table become pach + moqesh. → Rom 11:9: Israel's blessing-table became trap.
Ps 140:5 — pach + resheth (NET) + moqesh together. Full trap vocabulary converges.
Ps 142:3, 119:110, 64:5 — wicked lay snares SECRETLY. Concealment = essential attribute.

**WISDOM:**
Prov 29:25 — fear of man = moqesh. FEAR ITSELF is the trap mechanism.
Prov 13:14, 14:27 — law of wise / fear of LORD = depart from moqesh of DEATH. Antidote = wisdom/reverence.
Prov 7:23 — bird to pach; fool to harlot. Key: "knoweth not it is for his life."
Prov 20:25 — devouring holy thing = moqesh. Rash vows = self-entrapment.
Ecc 9:12 — fish in evil net + birds in pach + sons of men snared in evil TIME falling SUDDENLY (H6597). co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. Triple parallel: NET-fish ‖ SNARE-bird ‖ TIME-man.

**PROPHETIC:**
Isa 8:14 — God himself = pach + moqesh to Jerusalem inhabitants. Sanctuary becomes trap.
Isa 24:17-18 — FEAR (H6343) → PIT (H6354) → PACH chain. Escape one → fall into next. Inescapable cascade. Jer 48:43-44 repeats identically for Moab. Pattern = universal judgment mechanism.
Job 22:10 — pach + SUDDEN FEAR (H6597 pachad). co: ALARMED_FEAR.
Hos 5:1 — leaders = pach on Mizpah + NET on Tabor. Shepherds became trappers.
Hos 9:8 — prophet = pach of fowler. False prophet IS the snare.

**NT:**
Lk 21:35 — DEFINING. "As a pagis shall it come on ALL dwelling on face of ALL earth." Day of LORD = global snare. co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, RETURN_OF_CHRIST. Anti: "watch and pray to ESCAPE" (v36).
1Tim 6:9 — desire for riches = pagis → destruction (G3639) + perdition (G684). co: BABYLON wealth-system.
1Tim 3:7 — pagis of devil. 2Tim 2:26 — recover from pagis of devil. Devil = fowler (= Ps 91:3).
Rom 11:9 — quoting Ps 69:22. Israel's table = pagis + stumbling-block + recompense.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **CONCEALMENT=ESSENCE.** Every snare is HIDDEN. Prov 1:17 — net spread in sight of bird = futile. Visibility nullifies trap. → Watchfulness is the antidote (Lk 21:36).
2. **IDOLATRY=PRIMARY TRIGGER.** Exo 23:33→Judg 8:27→Ps 106:36. Idol-worship IS the snare.
3. **FEAR→PIT→SNARE CHAIN.** Isa 24:17-18 = Jer 48:43-44. Three-stage inescapable cascade.
4. **SELF-ENTRAPMENT.** Ps 9:15, 35:8 — caught in own snare. Prov 12:13, 29:6 — sin = own trap.
5. **GLOBAL SNARE = DAY OF LORD.** Lk 21:35 — pagis on ALL earth. Ecc 9:12 — evil time SUDDENLY. Universality + concealment + suddenness = Day-of-LORD signature.
6. **ESCAPE EXISTS.** Ps 124:7 — snare BROKEN. 2Tim 2:26 — recovery possible. Lk 21:36 — watch+pray. Snare ≠ fate — alertness defeats it.
7. **ANTI-SLEEP.** Snare catches the unaware/sleeping. Lk 21:34 "take heed lest... that day come upon you." co: PERPETUAL_SLEEP. Wakefulness = anti-snare.
