## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H4170 moqesh — from H3369 yaqosh (to ensnare); a noose/hook. ~27× OT. H6341 pach — from H6351 pachach (to spread flat); metallic sheet pounded thin → spring-net spread like a lamina = CONCEALED flat trap. ~25× OT (some = literal metal plates: Exo 39:3, Num 16:38). H3369 yaqosh — primitive root: to ensnare. → H3352/H3353 yaqosh/yaqush = fowler/snarer. G3803 pagis — from G4078 pegnymi (to fasten/fix); trap fastened by noose/notch. 5× NT. Two Hebrew nouns = two trap types: moqesh = NOOSE (tightens), pach = SPRING-NET (collapses). Both = concealed, triggered, irreversible.

**LAW/NARRATIVE:**
Exo 23:33, 34:12, Deut 7:16 — idolatrous nations in land = moqesh. COHABITATION with condemned → entrapment. 3× Torah.
Judg 2:3, 8:27 — fulfilled: nations' gods + Gideon's ephod = moqesh. IDOLATRY = trigger.
1Sam 18:21 — Saul uses daughter as moqesh for David. Relationship weaponized.
Ps 106:36 — idols = moqesh. Law principle confirmed in history.

**PSALMS (DELIVERANCE):**
Ps 91:3 — pach of fowler. co: PESTILENCE. God delivers from concealed trap.
Ps 124:7 — soul escaped as BIRD from pach; snare BROKEN (H7665). Escape = trap destroyed, not merely evaded.
Ps 18:5 / 2Sam 22:6 — moqesh of DEATH surrounded me. co: SHEOL. Death has a snare-mechanism.
Ps 11:6 — God RAINS pach on wicked + FIRE + brimstone. Trap-mechanism turned on trappers.
Ps 69:22 — table become pach + moqesh. → Rom 11:9: Israel's blessing-table became trap.
Ps 140:5 — pach + resheth (NET) + moqesh together. Full trap vocabulary converges.
Ps 142:3, 119:110, 64:5 — wicked lay snares SECRETLY. Concealment = essential attribute.

**WISDOM:**
Prov 29:25 — fear of man = moqesh. FEAR ITSELF is the trap mechanism.
Prov 13:14, 14:27 — law of wise / fear of LORD = depart from moqesh of DEATH. Antidote = wisdom/reverence.
Prov 7:23 — bird to pach; fool to harlot. Key: "knoweth not it is for his life."
Prov 20:25 — devouring holy thing = moqesh. Rash vows = self-entrapment.
Ecc 9:12 — fish in evil net + birds in pach + sons of men snared in evil TIME falling SUDDENLY (H6597). co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. Triple parallel: NET-fish ‖ SNARE-bird ‖ TIME-man.

**PROPHETIC:**
Isa 8:14 — God himself = pach + moqesh to Jerusalem inhabitants. Sanctuary becomes trap.
Isa 24:17-18 — FEAR (H6343) → PIT (H6354) → PACH chain. Escape one → fall into next. Inescapable cascade. Jer 48:43-44 repeats identically for Moab. Pattern = universal judgment mechanism.
Job 22:10 — pach + SUDDEN FEAR (H6597 pachad). co: ALARMED_FEAR.
Hos 5:1 — leaders = pach on Mizpah + NET on Tabor. Shepherds became trappers.
Hos 9:8 — prophet = pach of fowler. False prophet IS the snare.

**NT:**
Lk 21:35 — DEFINING. "As a pagis shall it come on ALL dwelling on face of ALL earth." Day of LORD = global snare. co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, RETURN_OF_CHRIST. Anti: "watch and pray to ESCAPE" (v36).
1Tim 6:9 — desire for riches = pagis → destruction (G3639) + perdition (G684). co: BABYLON wealth-system.
1Tim 3:7 — pagis of devil. 2Tim 2:26 — recover from pagis of devil. Devil = fowler (= Ps 91:3).
Rom 11:9 — quoting Ps 69:22. Israel's table = pagis + stumbling-block + recompense.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **CONCEALMENT=ESSENCE.** Every snare is HIDDEN. Prov 1:17 — net spread in sight of bird = futile. Visibility nullifies trap. → Watchfulness is the antidote (Lk 21:36).
2. **IDOLATRY=PRIMARY TRIGGER.** Exo 23:33→Judg 8:27→Ps 106:36. Idol-worship IS the snare.
3. **FEAR→PIT→SNARE CHAIN.** Isa 24:17-18 = Jer 48:43-44. Three-stage inescapable cascade.
4. **SELF-ENTRAPMENT.** Ps 9:15, 35:8 — caught in own snare. Prov 12:13, 29:6 — sin = own trap.
5. **GLOBAL SNARE = DAY OF LORD.** Lk 21:35 — pagis on ALL earth. Ecc 9:12 — evil time SUDDENLY. Universality + concealment + suddenness = Day-of-LORD signature.
6. **ESCAPE EXISTS.** Ps 124:7 — snare BROKEN. 2Tim 2:26 — recovery possible. Lk 21:36 — watch+pray. Snare ≠ fate — alertness defeats it.
7. **ANTI-SLEEP.** Snare catches the unaware/sleeping. Lk 21:34 "take heed lest... that day come upon you." co: PERPETUAL_SLEEP. Wakefulness = anti-snare.

## Fowler Connection

**THE FOWLER = THE TRAPPER = THE AGENT WHO SETS THE SNARE.**

**ROOTS:** H3369 yaqosh — primitive root: to ensnare. → H3352 yaqosh (active participle: entangler = fowler). H3353 yaqush (passive participle: entangled = snare; BUT transitive: a snarer = fowler). The snare (H4170 moqesh / H6341 pach) is the MECHANISM; the fowler (H3352/H3353) is the AGENT. Every snare presupposes a fowler — the trap doesn't set itself.

**FOWLER OCCURRENCES:**
Ps 91:3 — pach of the fowler (H3353) ‖ noisome pestilence (H1698). God delivers from BOTH. Fowler + PESTILENCE paired = the trapper operates through disease/plague. co: PESTILENCE.
Ps 124:7 — soul escaped as bird from pach of fowlers (H3369 participle). Snare BROKEN (H7665). Escape = fowler's device destroyed.
Prov 6:5 — deliver thyself from hand (H3027) of fowler (H3353). The fowler has a HAND = personal agency, not impersonal force.
Hos 9:8 — prophet (H5030) IS pach of a fowler (H3352) in all his ways. FALSE PROPHET identified AS the fowler's snare-mechanism. The prophet doesn't merely FALL INTO a snare — he IS the snare. co: FALSE_MESSIAH.
Jer 5:26 — wicked men among God's people: "as he that setteth snares (H3353 = fowler/snarer); they set a trap (H4889 mashchith), they CATCH MEN (H582)." Fowler's prey = MEN. Not birds. H3353 here = active: snarer/fowler. The wicked ARE fowlers.

**WHO IS THE FOWLER? — IDENTITY CHAIN:**
1Tim 3:7 — pagis (G3803) of the DEVIL (G1228 diabolos). 2Tim 2:26 — pagis of the DEVIL; taken captive (G2221 zogreo = captured alive) at HIS will. The DEVIL is the ultimate fowler. His snare captures men alive for his purpose.
Hos 9:8 — the FALSE PROPHET is the fowler's deployed snare. Not the fowler himself, but the fowler's instrument/mechanism.
Jer 5:26 — WICKED MEN among God's people function as fowlers. They catch men. Human agents executing the fowler's trade.

**FOWLER CHAIN:** DEVIL (ultimate fowler: 1Tim 3:7, 2Tim 2:26) → operates through FALSE PROPHETS (Hos 9:8, the snare-mechanism) → who are WICKED MEN among God's people (Jer 5:26) → who set SNARES (H4170/H6341) + TRAPS (H4889) → that CATCH MEN (Jer 5:26) → through CONCEALMENT (Prov 1:17: visibility defeats the trap) → targeting the SLEEPING/unaware (Lk 21:34-35).

**REVERSAL — GOD AS COUNTER-FOWLER:**
Jer 50:24 — "I have laid a snare (H3369) for THEE, O BABYLON, and thou wast NOT AWARE." God uses the fowler's own method against BABYLON. The trapper is trapped. She was not aware = concealment turned on the concealer. co: BABYLON, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.
Ps 11:6 — God RAINS pach on wicked. Trap-mechanism reversed.
Ps 9:15 — nations sunk in pit THEY made; in net THEY hid, their own foot taken. Self-entrapment.

**CROSS-SYMBOL CONNECTIONS:**
→ **DECEIVE**: The snare IS the deception mechanism. Mat 24:4 "take heed no man deceive you" = "watch for the fowler's snare." G4105 planao (lead astray) = the fowler's technique. Deception is HOW the snare is concealed.
→ **FALSE-MESSIAH**: Hos 9:8 — false prophet IS the fowler's instrument. The false prophet doesn't just deceive — he is structurally THE SNARE ITSELF. co: FALSE_MESSIAH, man-of-sin.
→ **PERPETUAL-SLEEP**: Snare catches the sleeping/unaware. Lk 21:34-35 surfeiting + drunkenness + cares = the anesthetic; the snare = the consequence. Sleep is the fowler's prerequisite. co: PERPETUAL_SLEEP.
→ **NET**: H2764 cherem = devoted-net. Hab 1:15-17 Babylon catches nations in net + drag, WORSHIPS the net. Snare (spring-trap for individuals) + net (drag-system for nations) = two scales of the same capture apparatus. Ps 140:5 pach + resheth (net) + moqesh together. co: NET, cherem.
→ **BABYLON**: The commercial/religious system IS the fowler's apparatus at civilizational scale. 1Tim 6:9 desire for riches = pagis → destruction + perdition. Babylon's wealth-system = the snare writ large. Jer 50:24 God snares Babylon with her own method. Hab 1:15-17 Babylon's net-worship. co: BABYLON, babylon-the-great.
→ **SUDDEN-DESTRUCTION**: Ecc 9:12 — sons of men snared (H3369) in evil TIME falling SUDDENLY (H6597). The snare's trigger = sudden destruction's arrival. Same moment, same mechanism. Lk 21:35 — the Day as pagis on ALL earth. co: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION.
→ **Lk 21:35 — DAY OF THE LORD = THE SNARE**: "As a pagis shall it come on ALL dwelling on face of ALL earth." The eschatological Day IS the fowler's trap sprung at global scale. The fowler (Devil) has been setting this snare throughout history; the Day is when it closes.

**PATTERN SYNTHESIS:**
8. **FOWLER=DEVIL, SNARE=FALSE PROPHECY.** The trap is not impersonal. It has an agent (Devil), an instrument (false prophet), a method (concealment/deception), a target (men), and a counter (watchfulness + God who snares the snarer).
9. **TWO-SCALE CAPTURE:** Snare (H4170/H6341) = individual trap. Net (H2764/H7568) = system-level trap. Both deployed by same fowler. Ps 140:5 shows both together. Babylon operates at net-scale; false prophets operate at snare-scale.
10. **REVERSAL IS CERTAIN.** Jer 50:24 + Ps 11:6 + Ps 9:15. The fowler's own snare catches him. Babylon snared by God using her own concealment. The trap always returns to its setter.
