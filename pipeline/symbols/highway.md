## Context Bag

**Etymology**: [H] *mesillah* (H4546) from *salal* (H5549) = "to mound up, cast up, exalt" → highway = *elevated* path, raised above common ground, cleared of obstacles. [G] *hodos* (G3598) = "a way, road, journey."

**Core argument**: HIGHWAY = covenant path (WHERE you walk) || WAY (*derek*, H1870) = conduct (HOW you walk). Both must align. Location + conduct inseparable.

**Way of Holiness**: Isaiah 35:8 — highway called "way of holiness"; unclean cannot pass over it → absolute separation between covenant-faithful + covenant-breakers. Highway + WAY joined: "an highway shall be there, *and a way*" → path (HIGHWAY) + conduct (WAY) unified as "way of holiness."

**Preparation through repentance**: Isaiah 40:3 — "prepare the way of the LORD, make straight a highway for our God" → fulfilled by John the Baptist (Matthew 3:1-3) calling Israel to repentance. Highway prepared not by physical construction but by turning hearts to covenant faithfulness. Valleys exalted, mountains made low = removal of obstacles to obedience. Co-occurs with WILDERNESS — place of testing where highway must be prepared.

**Covenant linkage**: Isaiah 33:8 — "highways lie waste…he hath broken the covenant" → when covenant broken, highways desolate. Highway ↔ covenant faithfulness: abandon one, lose the other. Direct parallel confirms symbolic identity.

**Moral direction**: Proverbs 16:17 — "highway of the upright is to depart from evil; he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul." Highway defined by trajectory *away from evil*. HIGHWAY (location) + WAY (conduct) distinguished in same verse.

**Wedding feast parable**: Matthew 22:1-14, esp. v.9 — king sends servants "into the highways" after original invitees refuse. Those on highways = already walking covenant path. Not sent to byways/hedges of lawlessness but to where faithful walk. Co-occurs with MARRIAGE (covenant picture). Tax collectors + sinners more faithful to covenant's heart than religious establishment who claimed its guardianship.

**Remnant return**: Isaiah 11:16 — highway for remnant returning from Assyria "like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt." Highway = covenant path of exodus, deliverance, return to LORD. Parallels SEA crossing on dry ground.

**Opposite — Byways**: Judges 5:6 — byways = crooked paths of unfaithfulness, opposite of raised highway. When highways abandoned, travelers walk byways.

**HIGHWAY vs WAY distinction table**: HIGHWAY (*mesillah*) = covenant path, WHERE you walk || WAY (*derek*) = conduct, HOW you walk. Isaiah 35:8 + Proverbs 16:17 both unite the two.

**Related symbols**: WAY → conduct on the path; WILDERNESS → testing ground where highway prepared; ROCK → covenant foundation highway built upon; TRUTH → standard defining right conduct on highway; MARRIAGE → covenant picture (Matthew 22 parable).
