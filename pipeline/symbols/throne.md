## Context Bag

**LEXICAL:** G2362 thronos = from thrao (to sit); stately seat, power, potentate. 62× NT (47× in Revelation). Both literal seat AND metonymy for authority itself. H3678 kisse' = from H3680 kasah (to cover/canopy); properly "covered" i.e. a canopied seat. Root: covering → concealment → authority IS a covering. H3764 korse' (Aramaic) = Dan 7:9 only; cognate of H3678. Note: Dan 7:9 thrones H3764 plural → judgment seats SET UP (not "cast down" as KJV ambiguity — H7412 remah = set/place in Aramaic).

**THRONE-HOLDER CHAIN — WHO SITS DETERMINES THE AGE:**
1. GOD: Ps 93:2 "thy throne established of old." Ps 103:19 "throne in heavens, kingdom rules over all." Isa 6:1 Lord on throne high + lifted up. Rev 4:2 ONE sat on throne. Eternal, unchallenged.
2. DAVIDIC: 2Sam 7:13-16 throne of kingdom forever. 1Ki 2:4 conditional on obedience. Ps 89:4,29,36 "seed forever, throne as the sun." Ps 132:11-12 "of thy body upon thy throne." Jer 33:17 "David never lack man on throne." Luke 1:32 "Lord God shall give him throne of his father David." Acts 2:30 "raise up Christ to sit on his throne." Unfulfilled in earthly terms → eschatological.
3. LAMB: Rev 3:21 "sit with me in MY throne, as I overcame and sat with my Father in HIS throne." TWO thrones: Father's (present session) and Lamb's (future/eternal). Rev 5:6 Lamb in MIDST of throne. Rev 7:17 Lamb in midst of throne shepherds. Rev 22:1,3 "throne of God AND of the Lamb" = merged authority.
4. SAINTS: Rev 20:4 thrones G2362 given, judgment given to them. Matt 19:28 twelve thrones judging twelve tribes. Luke 22:30 sit on thrones judging. Dan 7:9 thrones (plural) set up → for judgment panel, not God alone. Rev 3:21 overcomers sit WITH Christ.
5. USURPER: Isa 14:13 "I will exalt MY throne above stars of God." Rev 2:13 "where Satan's seat G2362 is." Rev 13:2 dragon gives beast his seat G2362 + authority. Rev 16:10 fifth vial on seat G2362 of beast → darkness. Counterfeit throne exists but terminates.

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**
Rev 4:2-6 — DEFINING THRONE SCENE: throne set in heaven, ONE sat on it, jasper/sardine appearance, rainbow G2463 like emerald, 24 elders on 24 seats G2362, lightnings + thunderings + voices from throne, seven lamps of fire = seven Spirits, sea of glass like crystal before throne, four living creatures round about. co: RAINBOW, ELDER, LIGHTNING, SEVEN_SPIRITS, SEA, FIRE.
Rev 4:9-10 — Living creatures give glory → 24 elders fall before throne, cast crowns before throne. Crowns returned to the One on throne. co: CROWN, WORSHIP.
Rev 5:1 — Book in right hand of Him on throne, sealed with seven seals. Throne-holder holds the scroll of destiny. co: SEAL, BOOK.
Rev 5:6-7 — Lamb in MIDST of throne takes book from Him on throne. Transfer of judicial authority from Father to Lamb. co: LAMB.
Rev 5:13 — "Blessing and honour and glory and power to him on the throne AND to the Lamb." Dual ascription = shared throne. co: LAMB.
Rev 6:16 — "Hide us from face of him on throne AND from wrath of Lamb." Throne + Lamb = source of wrath. co: WRATH, LAMB, MOUNTAIN.
Rev 7:9-17 — Great multitude before throne + before Lamb. Salvation ascribed to God on throne + Lamb. Lamb IN MIDST of throne shepherds them to living water. God wipes tears. co: LAMB, SALVATION, WATER, SHEPHERD.
Rev 20:4 — Thrones (plural), they sat on them, judgment given. Beheaded for witness + word. Lived and reigned 1000 years with Christ. co: JUDGMENT, KINGSHIP, OVERCOMER, MILLENNIUM.
Rev 20:11-12 — Great white throne, Him that sat on it → earth + heaven fled. Dead judged. co: JUDGMENT, BOOK, DEATH.
Dan 7:9 — Thrones H3764 set up, Ancient of Days sits, garment white as snow, throne like fiery flame, wheels burning fire, river of fire. co: FIRE, JUDGMENT, ANCIENT.
Ps 45:6 — "Thy throne O God forever and ever; sceptre of righteousness." Quoted Heb 1:8 = applied to the Son. Davidic king addressed AS God. co: KINGSHIP, RIGHTEOUSNESS.
Matt 19:28 — "in the regeneration G3824 when Son of Man sits on throne of his glory, YOU sit on twelve thrones." co: JUDGMENT, REGENERATION, TWELVE.
Isa 6:1 — Lord on throne high + lifted up, train fills temple. Seraphim cry "Holy holy holy." co: HOLY, TEMPLE.
Rev 3:21 — OVERCOMER PROMISE: "sit with me in my throne EVEN AS I overcame." Prerequisite = overcoming. Method = same as Christ's. co: OVERCOMER.
Rev 13:2 — Dragon gave beast his G2362 throne + great authority. Counterfeit investiture. co: DRAGON, BEAST.
Heb 4:16 — "Come boldly to the throne of G5485 grace." Throne = access point for mercy in present age. co: GRACE, MERCY.

**PATTERN:** Throne = governing authority made visible. God's throne is eternal (Ps 93:2). David's throne is promised to Christ (Luke 1:32, Acts 2:30). Lamb shares Father's throne now (Rev 3:21b), receives his own throne at consummation (Rev 22:1,3). Saints share Lamb's throne as overcomers (Rev 20:4, Matt 19:28, Rev 3:21a). Dragon counterfeits with rival throne (Rev 13:2). The question Scripture answers: WHO is on the throne? Current age: Lamb at Father's right hand (Heb 12:2). Consummation: God + Lamb share throne, river flows from it, no more curse (Rev 22:1-3). Overcomers seated with Him = the promise. Dan 7:9 thrones "set up" for judgment = the transition point.
