## Lexical Field

**[H6137] aqrab** = scorpion; figuratively a scourge or knotted whip. "Of uncertain derivation." 6× OT. Neighboring root cluster: H6131 aqar "to pluck up by roots, hamstring, exterminate" → H6135 aqar "barren" → H6138 Eqrown "Ekron" (="eradication"). Whether H6137 derives from this root or not, the semantic neighborhood is uprooting/barrenness/eradication. H4610 Ma'aleh Aqrabbim = "Ascent of Scorpions" (Num 34:4, Judg 1:36), from plural of H6137 — a steep desert pass at the boundary of the Promised Land.

**[G4651] skorpios** = scorpion (from its sting). "Probably from an obsolete root strengthened from G4649 skopos ('to peer about, a mark/target') and meaning to pierce." 5× NT. Etymology links PIERCING to WATCHING/TARGETING — the scorpion aims, then strikes. G2759 kentron = sting/prick/goad — used in Rev 9:10 for the stingers in scorpion tails. G929 basanismos = torture/torment — used in Rev 9:5 for scorpion-like torment.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **Literal venomous creature** — fits Deut 8:15 but fails Ezek 2:6 (people as scorpions), 1Kgs 12:11 (instrument of discipline), Rev 9 (composite supernaturals). Too narrow.
2. **Hostile enemies** — fits Ezek 2:6, Luke 10:19 but fails Deut 8:15 (natural hazard), Luke 11:12 (counterfeit provision, not enemy). Too generic.
3. **Severe punishment/oppression** — fits 1Kgs 12:11 well, partially Rev 9, but fails Ezek 2:6 (people, not punishment itself), Luke 11:12 (not about punishment). Confuses agent with action.
4. **Demonic spirits** — fits Rev 9, Luke 10:19 but fails Deut 8:15 (literal wilderness), 1Kgs 12:11 (political tool), Ezek 2:6 (rebellious Israelites). Too narrow to one register.
5. **Hidden ambush predator** — captures concealment but misses the distinctive property: non-lethal incapacitating sting. Serpents also ambush but KILL.
6. **Counterfeit/deceptive harm** — Luke 11:12 supports (egg vs scorpion). But 1Kgs 12:11 scorpions aren't counterfeit — they're openly threatened escalation. Deut 8:15 not about deception. Partial.
7. ✓ **Concealed agent of piercing torment that incapacitates without killing — non-lethal stinging pain** — passes ALL contexts. See substitution test. The DISTINCTIVE property is sting→torment→not death. Rev 9:5 makes this explicit: "not kill them, but that they should be tormented… as the torment of a scorpion." Scorpion ≠ serpent: serpent bites to kill (Num 21:6); scorpion stings to incapacitate.
8. **Testing instrument** — fits Deut 8:15 (wilderness testing) but Luke 11:12 (scorpion is the BAD gift, not God's test). Fails.
9. **Curse/plague agent** — fits Deut 8:15, Rev 9 but too broad. Many things are curse agents. Doesn't capture the distinctives (hidden, non-lethal, stinging).

## Substitution Test (meaning: "concealed stinging tormentor — incapacitating pain that does not kill")

- Deut 8:15 — wilderness with fiery serpents, [stinging tormentors], drought ✓ (hidden under rocks, strikes suddenly)
- 1Kgs 12:11 — "father chastised with whips, I with [stinging tormentors]" ✓ (escalation: surface lash → embedded piercing torment. Strong's notes: "figuratively, a scourge or knotted whip" — barbed, lingering)
- 1Kgs 12:14 / 2Chr 10:11,14 — same pattern repeated ✓ (Rehoboam's oppression = non-lethal but incapacitating governance)
- Ezek 2:6 — "briers and thorns with thee, dwell among [stinging tormentors]" ✓ (rebellious people who pierce and torment the prophet — CO: THORN. Note 3-stage escalation: briers→thorns→scorpions = irritation→wounding→incapacitating sting)
- Luke 10:19 — "power to tread on serpents and [stinging tormentors], over all power of enemy" ✓ (two enemy modalities: serpent=lethal deception, scorpion=incapacitating torment. Authority over BOTH)
- Luke 11:12 — "ask egg, give [stinging tormentor]?" ✓ (egg=nourishing provision; scorpion=concealed pain. A scorpion can curl to resemble an egg. The counterfeit delivers STING instead of sustenance)
- Rev 9:3 — locusts given power AS [stinging tormentors] of the earth ✓ (consuming swarm acquires stinging capacity)
- Rev 9:5 — torment AS [stinging tormentor] when it strikes a man; NOT kill but torment 5 months ✓ (DEFINING verse: explicitly non-lethal, explicitly incapacitating through pain)
- Rev 9:10 — tails LIKE [stinging tormentors] with stings; power to hurt 5 months ✓ (TAIL = trailing consequence; sting comes from BEHIND, from what follows)

## Context Bag

**SERPENT vs SCORPION DISTINCTION**: Luke 10:19 pairs them as two modalities of enemy power. SERPENT (G3789 ophis) = bites, kills, deceives (Gen 3, Num 21:6 — fiery serpents KILLED). SCORPION = stings, torments, incapacitates WITHOUT killing (Rev 9:5 explicit). Serpent targets the HEAD (Gen 3:15 heel↔head); scorpion strikes with TAIL (Rev 9:10). Serpent = lethal deception from the front; scorpion = lingering torment from behind. Jesus grants authority over BOTH: lethal+non-lethal, frontal+trailing.

**REV 9 LOCUST-SCORPION COMPOSITE**: Rev 9:3 — locusts from smoke given power AS scorpions. Two symbols merged: locust = God-commissioned consuming agent (see locust.md) + scorpion = stinging tormentor. Result: agents that both CONSUME and TORMENT. v.4 — inverted: DON'T hurt grass/trees (normal locust food), only unsealed men. v.5 — cannot KILL, only torment 5 months. v.10 — tails LIKE scorpions with STINGS (G2759 kentron). Scorpion-power is specifically the TAIL function: what comes AFTER, the trailing consequence. CO: SMOKE+PIT-ABYSS+LOCUST+SEAL. The consuming agent's sting is in what it leaves behind — not death but incapacitating residual pain.

**FIVE MONTHS**: Rev 9:5,10 — torment limited to 5 months. Natural scorpion season in Palestine ≈ May-September (5 months of warm weather when scorpions are active). The time-limit echoes the nature of scorpion torment: SEASONAL, not permanent. Incapacitating but not eternal. CO: the 5 months of flood waters prevailing (Gen 7:24) — another 5-month period of judgment that didn't permanently destroy but tested/separated.

**REHOBOAM'S SCORPIONS**: 1Kgs 12:11,14 / 2Chr 10:11,14 — whips (H7752 showt = lash, from H7751 "to travel/scourge") vs scorpions (H6137). Strong's itself glosses H6137 as "figuratively, a scourge or KNOTTED WHIP." The escalation: smooth lash = surface pain → knotted/barbed whip = embedded, tearing pain. Rehoboam's scorpion-governance directly caused the KINGDOM SPLIT (1Kgs 12:16-19). Incapacitating torment that doesn't kill the nation but fractures it. Political scorpion = governance that embeds lingering pain.

**EZEKIEL'S SCORPION-PEOPLE**: Ezek 2:6 — briers (H5621 sarab) + thorns (H5544 silown) + scorpions (H6137). Three-stage escalation of hostile environment: irritation → piercing → incapacitating torment. The rebellious house (H4805 meri) IS the scorpion — people whose opposition stings and incapacitates the prophet. "Be not afraid" 2× + "be not dismayed" = the sting's primary power is FEAR of the pain. God's counter: authority over the fear, not removal of the scorpions.

**COUNTERFEIT PROVISION (EGG)**: Luke 11:12 — scorpion (G4651) vs egg (G5609 oon). Context: father-child provision. Fish vs serpent (v.11), egg vs scorpion (v.12). Serpent = counterfeit fish (looks similar, is lethal). Scorpion = counterfeit egg (can curl to resemble egg, delivers sting). The scorpion CONCEALS itself as provision. Pattern: the enemy's non-lethal torment disguises itself as nourishment. The Father gives Holy Spirit (v.13) — the TRUE provision vs. counterfeit stinging substitutes.

**WILDERNESS HAZARD**: Deut 8:15 — fiery serpents (H8314 saraph + H5175 nachash) + scorpions (H6137) + drought (H6774 tsimmaown). The wilderness testing environment includes THREE threats: deception (serpent), torment (scorpion), deprivation (drought). God LED them THROUGH it — not around it. CO: WILDERNESS, SERPENT. The testing ground contains all three modalities of affliction; God's provision sustains through all three (water from rock, v.15; manna, v.16).

**ASCENT OF SCORPIONS**: Num 34:4, Judg 1:36 — Ma'aleh Aqrabbim (H4610), southern boundary of the Promised Land. A steep, barren pass. The scorpion-place marks the THRESHOLD between wilderness and promise. Judg 1:36 — Amorite boundary. To enter or leave requires ascending through scorpion territory. Pattern: transition through stinging torment at the boundary.

**PATTERN SUMMARY**: Five consistent properties: (1) CONCEALED — hides under rocks/curls like egg, strikes unexpectedly; (2) PIERCING — sting penetrates, embeds burning; (3) NON-LETHAL — explicitly cannot kill (Rev 9:5); (4) INCAPACITATING — pain immobilizes, prevents function; (5) TRAILING — strikes with TAIL (Rev 9:10), the consequence that follows. Scorpion vs serpent = torment vs death, incapacitation vs destruction, from behind vs from front. The Rev 9 LOCUST+SCORPION composite = consuming agents whose trailing consequence is incapacitating torment of the unsealed. Symbol chain: PIT→SMOKE→DARKNESS→LOCUSTS emerge→SCORPION-power in tails→5-month torment of unsealed. Cross-ref: locust.md, smoke.md, pit-abyss.md, seal.md.
