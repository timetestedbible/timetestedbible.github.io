## Context Bag

**1. EXPLICIT DEFINITION** — Rev.17:15 directly decodes: waters where harlot sits → peoples (λαοί) + multitudes (ὄχλοι) + nations (ἔθνη) + tongues (γλῶσσαι). Clearest symbolic key in Scripture. HARLOT+ sits ON sea → BABYLON+ rules over nations.

**2. SEA = CHAOTIC + TURBULENT** — Isa.57:20: wicked → like troubled sea, cannot rest, casts up mire/dirt. WICKEDNESS+ || restless sea. Isa.17:12: multitude of people → noise like seas; nations → rushing like mighty waters. Parallel structure: people || seas, nations || waters. Confirms equation directly.

**3. BEASTS FROM SEA** — Dan.7:2-3: FOUR WINDS+ strove upon great sea → four beasts came up from sea, diverse from one another. WIND+ (spirits/invisible power) acts on sea (nations) → ANIMAL+ (kingdoms) arise. Rev.13:1: beast rises out of sea, seven heads + ten horns. ANIMAL+ from sea → kingdom/empire emerges from mass of peoples. Sea = source-pool of political powers.

**4. CONTRAST: SEA vs DRY LAND/ISLAND** — Gen.1:9-10: waters gathered → dry land appears. God separates land from seas. Creation pattern establishes: land = ORDER, set-apart, stable || sea = CHAOS, mixed, unstable. ISLAND+ = land set apart FROM sea → sanctified people distinguished from chaotic nations. Opposite pair: sea (profane masses) vs land/island (holy/separated).

**5. NO MORE SEA** — Rev.21:1: new heaven + new earth, first passed away, "no more sea." In renewed creation → no more chaotic/rebellious/unsanctified mass of peoples. All turbulence eliminated. Substitution: "no more chaotic nations" ✓.

**SUBSTITUTION TEST** — All passages pass: Rev.17:15 (explicit ✓), Isa.57:20 "wicked like troubled nations" ✓, Isa.17:12 parallel confirms ✓, Dan.7:3 "kingdoms arose from nations" ✓, Rev.13:1 "kingdom arose from peoples" ✓, Rev.21:1 "no more rebellious nations" ✓.

**RELATED SYMBOL KEYS** — Sea as foundation unlocks chain: ISLAND = land set apart from sea → sanctified people. Beast from sea = ANIMAL+ power arising from nations → kingdom/empire. Ship on sea → entity navigating among nations. Fish in sea → people within nations. All depend on sea = chaotic peoples/nations.

**CORE LOGIC**: Explicitly defined (Rev.17:15) → confirmed by prophetic parallel (Isa.17:12) → illustrated by character (Isa.57:20, restless/wicked) → demonstrated in vision (Dan.7:2-3, Rev.13:1, beasts from sea) → grounded in creation pattern (Gen.1:9-10, separation of waters from land) → resolved eschatologically (Rev.21:1, no more sea).
