## Context Bag

KEY CONNECTION: EAGLE ↔ ANGEL — both have WINGS. WINGS → Covenant/Torah Reminder (covering/authority). EAGLE = entity possessing WINGS → messenger operating UNDER covenant authority.

CHERUBIM = EAGLE-FACED ANGELS: Ezekiel 1:10 — cherubim have "face of an eagle" (one of four faces). Ezekiel 10:14 — confirms eagle face on cherubim. Revelation 4:7 — fourth living creature "like a flying eagle" || Ezekiel cherubim parallel.

EAGLE'S WINGS + ANGEL (same context): Exodus 19:4 — "I bare you on eagles' wings" → God carried Israel (transport/bearing function). Exodus 23:20-21 — "I send an angel before you… my NAME is in him" → angel sent under covenant authority. Same narrative context: eagles' wings (Ex 19) + angel sent (Ex 23) → EAGLE = MESSENGER/ANGEL. Co-occurs: NAME → Covenant Relationship; WINGS → Covenant/Torah Reminder.

PARABLE DEFINITION (Ezekiel 17): Ezekiel 17:12 — first EAGLE = King of BABYLON (explicitly defined). Ezekiel 17:15 — second EAGLE = Egypt. Empires functioning as God's agents/messengers of judgment. Co-occurs: BABYLON → Worldly Kingdom. Context type: parable-definition (God interprets the symbol directly).

EAGLES AS JUDGMENT MESSENGERS: Hosea 8:1 — "eagle comes because they have transgressed my covenant" → messenger of judgment sent due to covenant violation. Deuteronomy 28:49 — nation comes "swift as the eagle" → foreign nation as God's judgment agent. Matthew 24:28 — "where the carcass is, there the eagles gather" → judgment messengers gather at point of death/destruction.

TWO DIMENSIONS:
- IS → Messenger — agent sent under authority
- DOES → Bears/Carries — delivers on behalf of sender (Exodus 19:4 "bare you on eagles' wings")

RELATIONSHIP TO WINGS: WINGS = authority/covering (covenant). EAGLE = entity WITH that authority. Eagle HAS wings → messenger operates UNDER covenant authority. WINGS is the attribute; EAGLE is the agent bearing it.

LOGIC CHAIN: Cherubim have eagle faces (Ezek 1:10, Rev 4:7) → cherubim are angelic messengers → eagles symbolize messengers. God bore Israel on "eagles' wings" (Ex 19:4) + sent "an angel before you" (Ex 23:20-21) → eagles' wings = angel's function. Empires explicitly called eagles in parable (Ezek 17:12, 17:15) → nations serve as God's messengers/agents of judgment. Eagles come BECAUSE of covenant transgression (Hos 8:1) → sent messengers, not random. Nations swift as eagle (Deut 28:49) + eagles gather at carcass (Matt 24:28) → judgment messenger pattern.

CONCLUSION: EAGLE = MESSENGER/ANGEL. The eagle-faced cherubim, the angel sent before Israel, and empires as God's agents all → same meaning: a messenger who bears/carries under covenant authority.
