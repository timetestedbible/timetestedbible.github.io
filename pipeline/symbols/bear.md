symbol: bear
name: BEAR
strongs: [H1677, H1678, G715]
words: ["bear", "bears", "she bears"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: Crushing, slow-moving dominion that devours indiscriminately — empire as brute consuming force. The bear does not hunt with cunning (serpent) or regal authority (lion) but with overwhelming mass and relentless appetite. "Arise, devour much flesh" (Dan 7:5). Consistently paired with lion as the second stage of threat.
opposite: LAMB (gentle, yielding — bear is unstoppable, devouring)

**H1677 dob** = "the bear (as slow)" from H1680 dabab = "to move slowly, glide." Root = SLUGGISH MOTION. Not speed or cunning — mass in motion. H1678 dob (Aramaic) = same, used in Dan 7:5. **G715 arktos** = "a bear (as obstructing by ferocity)" from G714 arkeo (to be sufficient/ward off). Greek root = OBSTRUCTION by force. Both roots converge: slow, massive, immovable, overwhelming.

## Context Bag

Dan 7:5 — subj: SECOND beast = bear (H1678). Raised on ONE SIDE (lopsided dominion — unbalanced power). THREE RIBS in mouth between teeth. Command: "Arise, devour much flesh." co: LION (v4=first beast), BEAST, IRON (v7=fourth). Traditionally = Medo-Persia (one side raised = Media subordinate to Persia). Three ribs = three conquered kingdoms (Lydia, Babylon, Egypt). Bear's DEFINING characteristic: voracious appetite + command to consume.
Rev 13:2 — subj: composite beast has feet of BEAR (G715). Body=leopard, mouth=LION, power from DRAGON. co: LION, DRAGON, BEAST. Bear FEET = the beast's METHOD OF MOVEMENT/TRAMPLING. Lion speaks (mouth), leopard is agile (body), bear crushes (feet). Dan 7's four empires merged into one end-time system: bear contributes the crushing, grinding, slow-moving bureaucratic weight.
1Sam 17:34-37 — subj: David slew lion AND bear. Bear took LAMB from flock. David caught it, struck it, delivered lamb from mouth. co: LION, SHEEP, SHEPHERD. Bear+lion = dual proving ground before Goliath (empire). SHEPHERD must defeat BOTH predator types: the royal (lion) and the crushing (bear). Bear specifically targets the LAMB — co: theme of empire devouring the innocent.
2Sam 17:8 — subj: Hushai describes David's men as "chafed (H4751 = bitter) as a BEAR ROBBED OF WHELPS in the field." co: WAR. Bear robbed of cubs = most dangerous state. Maternal fury = unstoppable rage when core identity threatened.
2Ki 2:24 — subj: TWO she-bears from the wood mauled FORTY-TWO youths who mocked Elisha. co: JUDGMENT. Bear as covenant-enforcement agent. 42 = Rev 13:5 (42 months). Two bears = witnesses of judgment. Mocking the prophet = mocking the covenant.
Prov 17:12 — subj: bear robbed of whelps meeting a man = BETTER than meeting a FOOL in his folly. co: FOOL. Bear's rage is PREDICTABLE; fool's destruction is not. Bear = known danger; folly = chaotic danger.
Prov 28:15 — subj: roaring LION + ranging BEAR = WICKED RULER over poor. co: LION. Lion roars (intimidates), bear ranges (H8264 shaqaq = runs greedily/roams). Lion+bear = dual nature of oppressive government: intimidation + relentless consumption.
Isa 11:7 — subj: COW and bear shall feed together; young lie down together. Lion eats straw. co: LION, COW. Kingdom restoration: bear's predatory nature removed. Herbivore peace. Bear+cow together = predator+prey reconciled.
Isa 59:11 — subj: "we roar (H1993 hamah) all like bears." Israel mourning/groaning for justice that does not come. co: DOVE (mourn like doves). Bear's roar = not aggression here but FRUSTRATED LONGING. Powerful creature that cannot achieve its goal.
Lam 3:10 — subj: GOD = bear lying in wait, lion in secret places. co: LION. God-as-predator against Judah. Bear ambushes (contrary to slow nature) = God's judgment unexpected from His own people's perspective. Even the "slow" judgment arrives.
Hos 13:8 — subj: "I will meet them as a bear BEREAVED of whelps, and will REND the caul of their heart." co: LION (v8b "devour as lion"), WILD BEAST. GOD as bereaved bear against Israel. Rend the HEART-COVERING = expose what's inside. Bear strips away protection to reveal the interior.
Amos 5:19 — subj: flee LION → meet BEAR → enter house → SERPENT bites. co: LION, SERPENT. THREE-STAGE inescapable judgment: (1) lion = open imperial threat, (2) bear = crushing alternative, (3) serpent = deceptive personal attack. No escape route. Bear is the MIDDLE stage — between visible power and hidden cunning.

**CANDIDATES**: (1) Medo-Persia → Dan 7:5 tradition, but doesn't work in 2Ki 2:24 or Prov. (2) Brute/crushing force → consistent across Dan 7, Rev 13:2, 1Sam 17. (3) Maternal rage → 2Sam 17:8, Prov 17:12, Hos 13:8 — partial but powerful sub-theme. (4) Indiscriminate devouring → "devour much flesh" (Dan 7:5), ranges (Prov 28:15), mauls 42 (2Ki 2:24) — strong. (5) Slow but unstoppable → H1677 root "slow," contrasts with lion's speed — consistent. (6) Bureaucratic empire → Rev 13:2 feet (method of movement), grinding administration — works for apocalyptic but narrow. (7) Crushing dominion that devours indiscriminately = BEST composite. Substitution: Dan 7:5 ✓ (empire that consumes mass of flesh), Rev 13:2 ✓ (grinding feet), 1Sam 17 ✓ (consumes the lamb), 2Ki 2:24 ✓ (crushing judgment), Prov 28:15 ✓ (ruler who ranges consuming), Hos 13:8 ✓ (God's crushing exposure).

**PATTERNS**: (1) LION+BEAR PAIRING: always together — 1Sam 17 (shepherd's test), Prov 28:15 (wicked rulers), Dan 7 (empires 1-2), Amos 5:19 (stages of judgment), Isa 11:7 (kingdom peace), Lam 3:10 (God's judgment). Lion = first/royal threat, bear = second/crushing threat. Ascending weight: lion can be faced with courage (Prov 28:1), bear cannot be reasoned with. (2) LION+BEAR+SERPENT: Amos 5:19 gives the FULL SEQUENCE: authority → crushing force → deception. Three modes of enemy attack. All three merge in the composite beast (Rev 13:2). (3) BEREAVED BEAR: 2Sam 17:8, Prov 17:12, Hos 13:8 — the bear robbed of cubs is the MOST DANGEROUS state. When empire loses what it considers its own, its fury becomes measureless. God Himself uses this image for His wrath when Israel is taken. (4) BEAR FEET: Rev 13:2 — the end-time beast MOVES like a bear: slow, grinding, crushing everything underfoot. Not flashy conquest but systematic trampling. Bureaucratic/administrative destruction. (5) THREE RIBS: Dan 7:5 — bear already has conquest IN ITS MOUTH. Not hunting — already consuming. Three = completeness of prior conquests fueling further appetite.
