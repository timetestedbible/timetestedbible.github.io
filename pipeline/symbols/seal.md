## Context Bag

**H2856 chatham** (verb): "to close up; especially to seal." KJV: make an end, mark, seal up, stop. Primitive root. Semantic domain: closing/shutting with authority. **H2368 chotham** (noun): "signature-ring" — from H2856. The instrument that impresses. **H2857** Aramaic cognate (Dan 6:17). **H2858 chothemeth** feminine form (Gen 38:25). **G4973 sphragis** (noun): "a signet (as fencing in or protecting from misappropriation); stamp impressed as mark of privacy or genuineness." Derivation: strengthened from G5420 phrasso = to fence/block. **G4972 sphragizo** (verb): "to stamp with signet for security or preservation; by implication, to keep secret, to attest." **G2696 katasphragizo**: intensive — "to seal closely" (Rev 5:1 only).

**CANDIDATE MEANINGS TESTED:**
1. Physical closure → fails Song 8:6, Eph 1:13. Too literal.
2. Authentication → fails Dan 12:4, Rev 20:3. Too narrow.
3. Ownership/identity → fails concealment contexts (Dan 12:4, Isa 29:11). Partial.
4. Protection → fails legal contexts (Est 8:8, Jer 32:10). Partial.
5. Restraint → fails identity contexts (Song 8:6, Eph 1:13). Partial.
6. Concealment → fails identity/ownership contexts. Partial.
7. Confirmation/attestation → fails concealment contexts. Partial.
8. **Authority's binding claim** → WORKS in ALL contexts. The signet impresses sovereign identity; what is sealed is BOUND to that authority's purpose — whether to identify, protect, restrain, authenticate, or conceal. Tested: Est 8:8 ✓ Song 8:6 ✓ Eph 1:13 ✓ Rev 5:1 ✓ Rev 7:3 ✓ Dan 12:4 ✓ Job 9:7 ✓ 2Tim 2:19 ✓ Rev 20:3 ✓ Jer 32:10 ✓.
9. Completion/finishing → fails most contexts. Too narrow.

**FIVE OPERATIONAL MODES (same root, different applications):**

**A) IDENTITY/OWNERSHIP — "you belong to me":**
Song 8:6 — "set me as seal upon thine heart, upon thine arm" = permanent claim on thoughts+actions. Hag 2:23 — Zerubbabel "I will make thee as a signet" = God's chosen representative (reverses Jer 22:24 where Coniah plucked off as signet). Gen 38:18,25 — Judah's signet = personal identity (proves paternity). Exo 28:11,21,36; 39:6,14,30 — priestly stones+plate engraved "like engravings of a signet" = HOLINESS TO THE LORD = God's identity pressed into priestly garments.

**B) LEGAL AUTHORITY — "this cannot be reversed":**
Est 8:8 — "sealed with king's ring, may no man reverse" = DEFINING verse. Est 3:12; 8:10 — same. 1Ki 21:8 — Jezebel sealed with Ahab's seal = usurped authority. Dan 6:17 — king sealed den with signet = purpose cannot be changed. Neh 9:38; 10:1 — sealed the covenant = binding agreement. Jer 32:10-14,44 — sealed evidence of purchase = legal proof preserved.

**C) RESTRAINT/CONCEALMENT — "held back until appointed time":**
Dan 12:4,9 — "seal the book till time of the end" = restrict access by divine authority. Isa 29:11 — sealed book cannot be read. Rev 5:1 — book sealed (G2696 intensive) with seven seals = completely bound. Rev 10:4 — "seal up what thunders uttered, write them not." Dan 9:24 — "seal up vision and prophecy" = bind until fulfilled. Deut 32:34 — "sealed up among my treasures." Rev 22:10 — "seal NOT" = inverse: time is at hand, restriction lifted.

**D) PROTECTION — "untouchable by judgment":**
Rev 7:2-3 — seal of living God on servants' foreheads BEFORE judgment released. Rev 9:4 — locusts cannot hurt those WITH seal of God. 2Tim 2:19 — "foundation having this seal: The Lord knoweth them that are his." Eph 4:30 — "sealed unto the day of redemption" = preserved through to completion.

**E) CONFIRMATION/ATTESTATION — "this is genuine":**
John 3:33 — "set to his seal that God is true." Rom 4:11 — circumcision = seal of righteousness of faith. 1Cor 9:2 — "seal of mine apostleship are ye." John 6:27 — "him hath God the Father sealed" = attested/authorized. 2Cor 1:22 — "sealed us, given earnest of Spirit." Eph 1:13 — "sealed with holy Spirit of promise."

**PHYSICAL PROCESS = SYMBOLIC KEY:**
Signet ring (unique identity engraved) → pressed into wax/clay → impression left = authority BOUND to object. The seal IS the authority's identity transferred. This is why Spirit = seal (Eph 1:13; 2Cor 1:22): God's identity impressed on believers.

**SEAL ↔ MARK DISTINCTION:**
Both appear on foreheads (Rev 7:3 seal || Rev 13:16 mark). SEAL (G4973) emphasizes WHO OWNS — authority's binding claim. MARK (G5480 charagma) emphasizes WHAT YOU DO — visible practice revealing allegiance. Seal = the covenant claim; Mark = the evidence of it. Related but not identical. Ezek 9:4 TAV mark on those who sigh for abominations → Rev 7:3 seal on servants → same protective function.

**SEAL ↔ FOUR HORSEMEN:**
Rev 6:1-8: seals RESTRAIN horsemen; opening seals RELEASES judgment. Seven seals = complete divine restraint on covenant judgment timing. Rev 7:1-3: inverse operation — angels hold back four winds UNTIL servants sealed. Same authority, opposite direction: seals ON scroll = judgment restrained; seal ON servants = protection FROM judgment released.

**SEAL ↔ THE END:**
Dan 12:4,9 — sealed TILL time of end. Rev 22:10 — seal NOT, time is at hand. THE END (G5056 telos) = covenant fulfillment point; SEAL = authority restricting until that point. When seal is broken, fulfillment proceeds.

**ANOMALIES:**
Lev 15:3 — H2856 "stopped" (flesh stopped from issue) = physical closing, root meaning. Job 24:16 — H2856 "marked" houses = identified/claimed for break-in. 2Cor 11:10 — G4972 "stop" boasting = shut/seal. Ezek 28:12 — king of Tyre "sealest up the sum" = embodies/contains fullness (authority's claim on completeness). Job 9:7 — God "sealeth up stars" = restrains by authority. Job 37:7 — "sealeth up hand of every man" = binds action. Job 33:16 — "sealeth their instruction" = binds/impresses teaching. All anomalies resolve to core: authority binding/closing/claiming.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Seal = authority's binding claim impressed on what it marks. Applied to persons → ownership + protection. Applied to documents → legal force + irrevocability. Applied to revelation → concealment until appointed time. Applied to judgment → restraint until release. The seal answers one question: WHOSE AUTHORITY GOVERNS THIS? Every use — from Judah's signet proving identity, to priestly engravings declaring HOLINESS TO THE LORD, to the seven seals restraining apocalyptic judgment, to the Holy Spirit sealing believers — reduces to sovereign identity impressed as binding claim.
