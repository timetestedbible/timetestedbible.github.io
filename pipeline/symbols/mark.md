## Context Bag

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: H226 (אוֹת / 'owth) = "mark" = "sign" = "token" — KJV translates ONE Hebrew word three ways. Gen 4:15 "mark"{H226} on Cain || Exo 31:13 Sabbath = "sign"{H226} || Gen 9:12 rainbow = "token"{H226} || Gen 17:11 circumcision = "token"{H226}. Understanding one → illuminates all; same concept.

WHAT IS THE H226? Rainbow (Gen 9:12), circumcision (Gen 17:11), blood on doorposts (Exo 12:13), Sabbath (Exo 31:13), commandments on hand/forehead (Deut 6:8). Common thread: all are OBSERVANCES — practices identifying covenant membership.

KEY PROOF 1 — Deut 6:6-8: v.6 "these words which I command" → v.8 "bind THEM for a sign{H226} upon thine hand… frontlets between thine eyes." The "them" = commandments. Commandments themselves ARE the sign/mark.

KEY PROOF 2 — Exo 13:9: "sign unto thee upon thine HAND… memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth." Sign on hand explicitly = practicing LORD's law.

HAND + FOREHEAD: Hand → actions/works (what you DO) + Forehead → mind/thoughts (what you BELIEVE/THINK). Mark in both = practices AND beliefs aligned with that authority.

TWO-MARK CONTRAST: God's mark = keep Sabbath (Exo 31:13,17), observe commandments (Deut 6:6-8), do+think per God's word. Beast's mark = practice beast's ordinances, do+think per beast's system. Rev 14:1 Father's NAME in foreheads || Rev 13:16 beast's MARK in hand/forehead. Rev 14:12 "keep commandments of God" || Rev 14:9 "worship beast and his image." Rev 7:3 sealed by God || marked by beast. → MARK identifies which authority's practices you observe.

EZEKIEL MARK — H8420 (תָּו / tav): Ezek 9:4,6 — mark = Hebrew letter TAV (paleo form: X/+). Given to those who "sigh and cry for abominations." Those WITH tav → protected; WITHOUT → slain. Hearts + practices aligned with God's standard → marked.

MULTIPLE ORIGINALS: H226 ('owth) = sign/token/mark — observance [primary]; H8420 (tav) = letter-mark [Ezek 9:4,6]; G5480 (charagma) = stamp/imprint [Rev 13-20]; G4742 (stigma) = slave-brand [Gal 6:17]; G4649 (skopos) = goal/target [Phil 3:14, different concept]. G5480 charagma relates to same core: visible identification of allegiance through practice.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SYMBOLS: NAME → covenant relationship itself; MARK → observable practice showing WHICH covenant; TRUTH → content of what is observed; FAITH → response to standard (practicing it). NAME is the covenant; MARK is the evidence of it.

MARK ≠ covenant itself (that = NAME). MARK = what you practice that REVEALS your master. You TAKE mark by PRACTICING what an authority commands. God's mark = His commandments/Sabbath/ways; beast's mark = beast's calendar/laws/ways. Practices reveal master.
