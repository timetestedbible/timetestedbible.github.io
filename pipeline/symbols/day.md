## Context Bag

**Definitional:** Gen 1:5 — God called LIGHT → DAY, DARKNESS → NIGHT. Foundational equation: DAY = LIGHT. Since LIGHT → Example/Visible Obedience, DAY → the *time/season* of that visibility. DAY relates to LIGHT as time-frame relates to state. || 1 Thess 5:5 — "children of LIGHT + children of DAY; not of NIGHT nor DARKNESS" — explicit four-term parallel confirming DAY||LIGHT vs NIGHT||DARKNESS.

**Functional evidence (5 functions):** (1) Time for work — John 9:4: "work while it is DAY; NIGHT cometh when no man can work." (2) Time of visibility — John 11:9: "walk in DAY → stumbleth not, seeth LIGHT." (3) Time of honest conduct — Rom 13:13: "walk honestly, as in the DAY." (4) Time of accountability — 1 Thess 5:4: "not in DARKNESS that that DAY should overtake you as thief." (5) Time of judgment — 2 Pet 3:10: "DAY of the Lord → works burned up"; 1 Cor 3:13: "the DAY shall declare [every man's work] — revealed by fire."

**"Day of the Lord" pattern:** 1 Thess 5:2 — "DAY of the Lord cometh as thief in NIGHT" + 2 Pet 3:10 — works exposed/burned + 1 Cor 3:13 — "DAY shall declare it." Pattern: DAY of Lord = ultimate exposure/judgment of FRUIT (works). Believers should walk NOW as if that DAY has arrived.

**Behavioral evidence:** Walk honestly in it (Rom 13:13). Be children of it (1 Thess 5:5). Work while in it (John 9:4). Be sober in it (1 Thess 5:8). John 9:4-5 — Jesus identifies DAY + his presence as LIGHT of world.

**Human application:** YES — 1 Thess 5:5: "children of the DAY"; 1 Thess 5:8: "who are of the DAY." Believers belong to realm of visibility + accountability, not hiddenness.

**Rejected alternatives:** "Daytime hours" → physical only, not symbolic. "Visible obedience" (= LIGHT) → DAY emphasizes TIME aspect, LIGHT emphasizes STATE. "Opportunity" alone → misses accountability/exposure dimension.

**Key distinction from LIGHT:** LIGHT = state of visible obedience; DAY = time-season when that visibility applies. DAY is the temporal frame; LIGHT is the quality within it.

**Substitution confirmations:** Gen 1:5 ✓ | Rom 13:12 "time of accountability is at hand" ✓ | Rom 13:13 "walk honestly, as in exposure" ✓ | John 9:4 "work while it is opportunity/visibility" ✓ | 1 Thess 5:5 "children of accountability" ✓ | 1 Thess 5:8 "who are of visibility" ✓ | 1 Cor 3:13 "time of exposure shall declare it" ✓✓

**Co-symbol notes:** LIGHT + DAY always parallel (Gen 1:5, 1 Thess 5:5, John 9:4-5, Rom 13:12). DARKNESS + NIGHT always opposite (Gen 1:5, 1 Thess 5:5, Rom 13:12). FRUIT/works exposed by DAY (1 Cor 3:13, 2 Pet 3:10). SLEEP implicit via 1 Thess 5:4-8 context ("let us not SLEEP as do others").
