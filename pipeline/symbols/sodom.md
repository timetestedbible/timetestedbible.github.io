## Etymology

H5467 סְדֹם (Cedom/Sedom), pron. "sed-ome'." Derivation: unused root meaning "to scorch." Strongs: "burnt (i.e. volcanic or bituminous) district; Sedom, a place near the Dead Sea." The name itself = scorched earth. Name IS the fate.
G4670 Σόδομα (Sodoma). Plural of Hebrew origin (H5467). NT carries OT name unchanged.

## Candidate Meanings

1. **Geographic place ("burnt district")** — Explains literal location but not prophetic function. Isa 1:10 "rulers of Sodom" = Israel's rulers, not geographic. Rev 11:8 "spiritually called Sodom" = functional name. ✗ too narrow.

2. **Sexual immorality** — Traditional from Gen 19:4-8 + Jude 1:7 "going after strange flesh." But Ezek 16:49 explicitly names the iniquity: "pride, fullness of bread, abundance of idleness." Sexual dimension = symptom not essence. Most OT refs don't mention sex at all. ✗ part only.

3. **Pride / self-sufficiency** — Ezek 16:49 lists pride first. But pride is too generic — every sin involves pride. Doesn't explain fire-from-heaven pattern or Luke 17 eating/drinking/buying/selling specifics. ✗ too broad.

4. **Total corruption deserving total destruction** — Works for Gen 18:20 "sin very grievous" + Abraham's intercession failing. But makes Sodom merely about degree of sin, not character of sin. Doesn't explain Ezek 16:49's economic details. ✗ quantity not quality.

5. **City at ease under imminent divine judgment** — Ezek 16:49: pride + fullness of bread + idleness. Luke 17:28-29: eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building → fire. 1Th 5:3 pattern: "peace and safety" → sudden destruction. Captures the PATTERN well. ✓ fits most contexts.

6. **Example/type of complete irreversible overthrow** — Most prophetic uses: "as God overthrew Sodom" (Isa 13:19, Jer 49:18, 50:40, Amos 4:11). Focus = manner of destruction. But reduces Sodom to judgment-event only, not the character that triggers it. ✗ effect not cause.

7. **Prosperous city whose abundance becomes fuel for judgment** — Gen 13:10 "well watered everywhere... as garden of the LORD, like Egypt" = paradise BEFORE destruction. Ezek 16:49 fullness of bread + idleness = material prosperity without covenant responsibility. Luke 17:28-29 normal prosperous life → fire. Deut 32:32 "vine of Sodom" = produces poison despite being well-watered. Abundance self-consuming. ✓ strong.

8. **Babylon's moral face — indulgence without covenant, consumed from above** — Aligns with four-faces framework (Egypt=bondage, Tyre=commercial, Sodom=moral, Babylon=whole). Rev 11:8 "spiritually called Sodom AND Egypt" = both faces applied to Jerusalem. Lot extracted = "come out my people" (Rev 18:4) pattern. ✓ integrates with system.

**SELECTED: #5 + #7 + #8 combined.** Sodom = Babylon's moral face — prosperous city at ease in covenant violation, whose abundance without righteousness becomes fuel for sudden fire-judgment from heaven. The character: pride + fullness + idleness + neglect of poor. The pattern: normal life masking covenant violation → sudden total fire.

## Substitution Tests

1. **Gen 13:10-13** — Lot chose toward [prosperous ease under imminent judgment]. "Well watered as garden of LORD" = paradise of abundance. "Men wicked and sinners exceedingly" = violation amid plenty. ✓
2. **Isa 1:9-10** — "Rulers of [city-at-ease-in-violation]" = Israel prosperous but corrupt, barely a remnant survives. ✓
3. **Isa 13:19** — Babylon overthrown "as God overthrew [prosperous ease suddenly consumed]." Babylon shares Sodom-face fate. ✓
4. **Jer 23:14** — Jerusalem prophets "as [city prosperous in violation]" — adultery, lies, strengthening evildoers, none returns from wickedness. ✓
5. **Ezek 16:49** — "Iniquity of thy sister [city-at-ease]: pride, fullness of bread, idleness, didn't help poor." Self-defining. ✓
6. **Luke 17:28-30** — "As in days of Lot" at [city eating/drinking/buying/building then suddenly consumed by fire from heaven]. Exactly the pattern. ✓
7. **2Pet 2:6** — Ensample to those who would live ungodly = pattern of prosperous ungodliness ending in fire. ✓
8. **Rev 11:8** — Jerusalem "spiritually called [moral-corruption-face]" = city corrupt from within, under judgment. ✓

## Context Bag

**Gen 10:19** — subj: border description. Sodom at edge of Canaan. co: Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim. DETAIL: listed with cities destroyed — foreshadowing.

**Gen 13:10-13** — subj: Lot's fatal choice. "Well watered everywhere, as garden of LORD, like land of Egypt." co: EGYPT (explicit comparison). Men "wicked and sinners exceedingly." CYCLE: patriarchal. LOT MOVED TOWARD Sodom in stages: (1) beheld, (2) chose, (3) dwelled in cities of plain, (4) pitched tent toward, (5) sat in gate (Gen 19:1). Gradual absorption into prosperous corruption.

**Gen 14:2-22** — subj: war of kings → Lot captured → Abram rescues. King of Sodom offers goods; Abram refuses. co: BREAD (refused provision from Sodom). DETAIL: Abram's hand lifted to "most high God, possessor of heaven and earth" = covenant loyalty vs Sodom's abundance. Pattern: entanglement with prosperous corruption requires extraction.

**Gen 18:16-26** — subj: Abraham intercedes. "Cry of Sodom great, sin very grievous." Bargains from 50→10 righteous. co: JERUSALEM (prayer model), FIRE (judgment pending). CYCLE: patriarchal. DETAIL: can't find 10 righteous = total corruption from fullness.

**Gen 19:1-28** — subj: destruction. Angels come at EVEN [H6153]. Lot in GATE = civic leader absorbed into system. All people "from every quarter" surround house = total corruption. Fire+brimstone from heaven. Lot's wife looks back → salt. Smoke "as smoke of a furnace." co: FIRE, BRIMSTONE, SMOKE, MOMENT, ANGEL. CYCLE: patriarchal/archetypal. DETAIL: "same day Lot went out" = extraction simultaneous with destruction (Luke 17:29). Angels physically pull Lot out (v16) = "the LORD being merciful." Lot lingers (v16) = reluctance to leave abundance.

**Deut 29:23** — subj: covenant-curse. "Brimstone, salt, burning... like overthrow of Sodom." co: FIRE, CHEREM-like desolation. CTX: Mosaic covenant. DETAIL: applied to Israel's OWN land if covenant broken. Sodom = what covenant violation produces.

**Deut 32:32** — subj: Song of Moses. "Vine of Sodom, fields of Gomorrah; grapes of gall, clusters bitter." co: VINE/WINE, FRUIT (poisonous). DETAIL: well-watered soil producing poison = abundance → corruption incarnate. Production chain: good soil + no covenant → toxic fruit.

**Isa 1:9-10** — subj: Israel nearly as Sodom. "Except LORD of hosts left us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom." "Rulers of Sodom... people of Gomorrah." co: JERUSALEM (implicitly), NAME (LORD of hosts). CTX: prophetic oracle. DETAIL: Sodom = functional descriptor for Israel's leadership. Only REMNANT prevents identity collapse.

**Isa 3:9** — subj: Jerusalem's brazenness. "Declare their sin as Sodom, hide it not." co: WICKEDNESS, PRIDE. DETAIL: not ashamed = Sodom-level corruption where sin becomes public identity.

**Isa 13:19** — subj: Babylon oracle. "As when God overthrew Sodom." co: BABYLON, FALL_OF_BABYLON. CTX: prophetic oracle. DETAIL: Babylon receives Sodom's fate = Sodom-pattern applied to Babylon proper. System's own face becomes its judgment.

**Jer 23:14** — subj: prophets of Jerusalem. "They are all of them unto me as Sodom." co: HARLOT (adultery), DECEIVE (walk in lies), WICKEDNESS. CTX: prophetic oracle. DETAIL: prophets strengthen evildoers, "none returns from wickedness." False leadership enabling prosperity-without-covenant = Sodom mechanism.

**Jer 49:18, 50:40** — subj: oracles against Edom and Babylon. "As in the overthrow of Sodom." co: FALL_OF_BABYLON, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. Standard comparison for irreversible overthrow. Both use H4114 mahpekah (overthrow).

**Lam 4:6** — subj: Jerusalem's fall. "Punishment greater than sin of Sodom, overthrown as in a moment [H7281 rega'], no hands stayed on her." co: MOMENT, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION. DETAIL: Jerusalem's punishment EXCEEDS Sodom's because Sodom fell quickly (mercy) but Jerusalem endured prolonged siege.

**Ezek 16:46-56** — DEFINING PASSAGE. Sodom = Jerusalem's SISTER (younger). Sodom's iniquity: (1) PRIDE [H1347 ga'own], (2) fullness of BREAD [H3899 lechem], (3) abundance of IDLENESS [H8252 sha'an = ease/quiet], (4) didn't strengthen hand of POOR [H6041] and NEEDY [H34 'ebyown]. Then (v50): "haughty [H1361 gabahh] and committed ABOMINATION [H8441 to'ebah]." Sexual sin = fruit of deeper root: prosperity + ease + neglect + pride → abomination. co: JERUSALEM, PRIDE, BREAD, IDOLATRY, HARLOT. CRITICAL: v53-55 "bring again captivity of Sodom" = restoration promise even for Sodom-type cities. v56 "Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy PRIDE" — Jerusalem too proud to even acknowledge Sodom as sister.

**Amos 4:11** — subj: Israel's judgment. "Overthrown as God overthrew Sodom, ye were as firebrand plucked from burning, yet have ye not returned unto me." co: FIRE, RETURN. DETAIL: Israel already partially judged Sodom-style but didn't repent. Extraction ("firebrand plucked") = mercy within judgment.

**Zeph 2:9** — subj: Moab/Ammon oracle. "Moab as Sodom." co: SALT, DESOLATION. Pattern applied to nations adjacent to Israel.

**Matt 10:15, 11:23-24; Mark 6:11; Luke 10:12** — subj: cities rejecting gospel > Sodom's guilt. "More tolerable for Sodom in day of judgment." co: JUDGMENT_DAY. DETAIL: Sodom had less light → less accountability. Cities with miracles/witness and still rejecting = worse than Sodom. Escalation principle: abundance of revelation + rejection = greater Sodom.

**Luke 17:28-30** — STRUCTURAL KEY. "As in days of Lot: they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded. But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven." co: DAYS_OF_NOAH (parallel), FIRE, BRIMSTONE, SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION, RETURN_OF_CHRIST ("day when Son of man is revealed"). DETAIL: six normal activities (eat, drink, buy, sell, plant, build) = complete cycle of prosperity. NOT described as sinful activities — the sin is the OBLIVIOUSNESS. Normal life masking covenant violation. Paired with Noah (marry/given in marriage) → same pattern, different judgment element (water→fire).

**Rom 9:29** — subj: Paul quoting Isa 1:9. "Except Lord of Sabaoth left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma." co: REMNANT, SEED. DETAIL: remnant theology — without divine preservation, covenant people = Sodom.

**2Pet 2:6** — subj: Sodom as ensample. "Turning cities to ashes, condemned with overthrow, making ensample [G5262 hupodeigma] unto those that after should live ungodly." co: FIRE (ashes), WICKEDNESS (ungodly). DETAIL: G2692 katastrophē = catastrophe/overthrow. Same root as H2015 haphak used in OT for Sodom's overthrow. The overthrow IS the example — not just the sin, but the judgment-pattern.

**Jude 1:7** — subj: eternal fire example. "Giving themselves over to fornication, going after strange flesh, set forth for example, suffering vengeance of eternal [G166 aiōnios] fire." co: FIRE, FORNICATION, HARLOT. DETAIL: "eternal fire" = not duration but quality — age-enduring pattern. Sodom's fire = prototype of final fire judgment.

**Rev 11:8** — CAPSTONE. "Great city, SPIRITUALLY [G4153 pneumatikōs] called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified." co: BABYLON, EGYPT, JERUSALEM. DETAIL: three names for ONE city — "great city" = Babylon (Rev 17:18). "Sodom" = moral corruption face. "Egypt" = bondage face. "Where Lord crucified" = Jerusalem. The city that kills the two witnesses carries all three functional names. ALL names = roles, not geography.

## Pattern Summary

**SODOM'S CYCLE:** ABUNDANCE → EASE → PRIDE → NEGLECT → ABOMINATION → CRY REACHES HEAVEN → FIRE FROM HEAVEN

**The Ezekiel Definition (16:49-50) governs all readings:**
1. Pride (H1347) — self-exaltation
2. Fullness of bread (H3899) — material abundance
3. Abundance of idleness (H8252) — ease/security
4. Neglect of poor/needy — covenant obligation abandoned
5. Abomination (H8441) — culminating transgression

**Luke 17:28-30 = Sodom's character enacted:**
Six activities (eat, drink, buy, sell, plant, build) = complete prosperous life without covenant reference. Same day Lot exits → fire falls. NO WARNING between extraction and destruction.

**FOUR-FACES FRAMEWORK (per babylon.md + egypt.md):**
- SODOM = moral face (corrupts through indulgence) — fire from ABOVE (Gen 19:24)
- EGYPT = bondage face (enslaves through provision) — HEALABLE (Isa 19:22)
- TYRE = commercial face (corrupts through trade) — fire from WITHIN (Ezek 28:18)
- BABYLON = the whole system — UNHEALABLE (Jer 51:9)

**Sodom uniquely = fire from above (external judgment) vs Tyre = fire from within (self-consuming).**
Both are Babylon-faces. Both end in fire. Source differs: Sodom receives fire; Tyre generates it.

**EXTRACTION PATTERN:** Gen 19:16 angels physically pull Lot → Rev 18:4 "come out of her my people." Lot lingered (v16) = reluctance to leave prosperity. Lot's wife looked back (v26) = attachment to abundance. Two-step failure: (1) reluctance to leave, (2) regret for what's lost.

**ROADMAP CONNECTIONS:**
- DAYS_OF_NOAH: Luke 17:26-30 pairs Noah (water) + Lot (fire) as twin patterns of coming judgment. 2Pet 3:5-7 water→fire escalation. We live in "reserved for fire" era.
- SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION: 1Th 5:3 "peace and safety → sudden destruction" = Sodom-pattern at eschatological scale.
- FALL_OF_BABYLON: Isa 13:19 Babylon falls "as Sodom." Rev 18:8 "in one day." Same face, same fire.
- RETURN_OF_CHRIST: Luke 17:30 "day when Son of man is revealed" = same day as fire.
