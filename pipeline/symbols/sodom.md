## Context Bag

**ETYMOLOGY:** H5467 Cedom from unused root = "to scorch." Name = FATE. G4670 Sodoma (plural).

**PATRIARCHAL:**
Gen 13:10-13 — subj: Lot's choice. "Well watered as garden of LORD, like Egypt." co: EGYPT. Lot's stages: beheld→chose→dwelled→pitched toward→sat in gate (19:1). Gradual absorption.
Gen 14:2-22 — Abram rescues Lot, REFUSES Sodom's provision. co: BREAD. Entanglement requires extraction.
Gen 18:16-26 — Abraham intercedes 50→10 righteous. Can't find 10 = total corruption from fullness.
Gen 19:1-28 — Fire+brimstone from heaven. "Same day Lot went out" = extraction simultaneous with destruction. Angels physically PULL Lot (v16); Lot LINGERS; wife looks back → salt. co: FIRE+BRIMSTONE+SMOKE+MOMENT.

**LAW:**
Deut 29:23 — Covenant-curse: Israel's land "like overthrow of Sodom." Sodom-fate applied to covenant-breakers.
Deut 32:32 — "Vine of Sodom": good soil + no covenant → toxic fruit. Abundance→corruption incarnate. co: VINE.

**PROPHETIC:**
Isa 1:9-10 — "Rulers of Sodom" = Israel's rulers. Only REMNANT prevents identity collapse.
Isa 3:9 — "Declare sin as Sodom, hide it not." Sin = public identity.
Isa 13:19 — "Babylon as Sodom overthrown." Sodom-pattern applied to Babylon proper. co: FALL_OF_BABYLON.
Jer 23:14 — Jerusalem prophets "as Sodom." False leadership enabling prosperity-without-covenant. co: HARLOT+DECEIVE.
Jer 49:18, 50:40 — Edom+Babylon: "as overthrow of Sodom." H4114 mahpekah. Standard comparison.
Lam 4:6 — Jerusalem's punishment EXCEEDS Sodom's. Sodom fell quickly (mercy); Jerusalem endured siege.
Ezek 16:46-56 — DEFINING. Sodom = Jerusalem's sister. Iniquity: (1) H1347 pride, (2) fullness of H3899 bread, (3) abundance of H8252 idleness, (4) didn't strengthen poor. THEN v50: H8441 abomination. Sexual sin = FRUIT of deeper root. v53-55: RESTORATION promise even for Sodom. v56: Jerusalem too proud to acknowledge Sodom as sister.
Amos 4:11 — "Firebrand plucked from burning, yet not returned." Partial Sodom-judgment + mercy rejected.

**NT:**
Matt 10:15, 11:23-24 — "More tolerable for Sodom." Abundance of revelation + rejection = WORSE than Sodom.
Luke 17:28-30 — STRUCTURAL KEY. Six activities: eat, drink, buy, sell, plant, build = complete prosperity. NOT sinful — sin is OBLIVIOUSNESS. "Same day Lot went out → fire." Paired with Noah (water→fire). co: DAYS_OF_NOAH+RETURN_OF_CHRIST.
2Pet 2:6 — G5262 hupodeigma (pattern) + G2692 katastrophē. The overthrow IS the example.
Jude 1:7 — "Eternal fire" = age-enduring PATTERN. Prototype of final fire.
Rev 11:8 — CAPSTONE. "Spiritually called Sodom AND Egypt, where Lord crucified." Three names, ONE city: Babylon (great city) + Sodom (moral face) + Egypt (bondage face). ALL names = roles, not geography.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **SODOM'S CYCLE:** Abundance→ease→pride→neglect→abomination→cry reaches heaven→fire from heaven.
2. **EZEK 16:49 GOVERNS:** Pride + fullness + idleness + neglect → abomination. THIS, not sexual sin, is the defining statement.
3. **FOUR FACES:** Sodom = moral (fire from ABOVE) ∥ Egypt = bondage (healable) ∥ Tyre = commercial (fire from WITHIN) ∥ Babylon = whole system (unhealable).
4. **EXTRACTION:** Gen 19:16 angels pull Lot → Rev 18:4 "come out my people." Two-step failure: reluctance to leave + regret for what's lost (wife looks back).
5. **FIRE SOURCE:** Sodom = external (heaven-sent). Tyre = internal (self-consuming). Both Babylon-faces, both end in fire, source differs.
6. **DAYS_OF_NOAH PAIR:** Luke 17:26-30 — Noah(water) + Lot(fire) as twin judgment patterns. 2Pet 3:5-7 water→fire escalation.
