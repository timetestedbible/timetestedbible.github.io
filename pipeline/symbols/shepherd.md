## Context Bag

**Root insight**: H7462 ra'ah = feed/rule + associate/companion → shepherd not distant ruler but one who walks WITH flock. "Pastor" (Eph 4:11 G4166) = exact same word as "shepherd" — not different roles.

**Divine identity**: God IS shepherd (Ps 23:1, Ps 80:1, Isa 40:11). Christ IS good shepherd (John 10:11, 10:14). Christ = "great shepherd...through blood of everlasting covenant" (Heb 13:20) + "Shepherd and Bishop of souls" (1 Pet 2:25). Messianic title: "the shepherd, the stone of Israel" (Gen 49:24) → SHEPHERD + ROCK co-occurrence = covenant link.

**Human application**: Elders appointed UNDER chief Shepherd (1 Pet 5:1-4). Pastors given as gift (Eph 4:11). God sets shepherds over people (Jer 23:4). "One shepherd...my servant David" (Ezek 34:23). David told "thou shalt feed [H7462] my people" (2 Sam 5:2). Role is derivative — tend God's flock on God's behalf.

**Function list**: Feeds/teaches (Ezek 34:2, John 21:16-17, 1 Pet 5:2) || Leads/goes before (John 10:4, Ps 23:2-3) || Knows by name (John 10:3,14,27) || Gives life for sheep (John 10:11,15) || Seeks lost (Ezek 34:12,16; Luke 15:4-6) || Binds broken/strengthens sick (Ezek 34:4,16) || Gathers (Isa 40:11, Jer 31:10, Ezek 34:13) || Example to flock (1 Pet 5:3) || Protects from wolves (John 10:12, 1 Sam 17:34-35) || Gives rest (Ezek 34:15, Ps 23:2). "Feed" [H7462] = "rule" — authority IS provision, not domination.

**Good vs. bad — core pattern**: Good shepherd gives life FOR sheep; bad shepherd takes life FROM sheep. Good feeds flock; bad feeds ON flock. Ezek 34:2: "Woe...shepherds that feed THEMSELVES! should not shepherds feed the flocks?" Bad shepherds: feed selves (Ezek 34:2-3), rule with force/cruelty (Ezek 34:4), scatter flock (Jer 23:1-2, Ezek 34:5-6), cause sheep to stray (Jer 50:6), seek own gain (Isa 56:11), eat fat/tear hooves (Zech 11:16), idol shepherd leaves flock (Zech 11:17), foolish shepherd (Zech 11:15), no pity (Zech 11:5), slumber (Nah 3:18). Punished alongside GOATS (Zech 10:3).

**Hireling antithesis** (John 10:12-13): No ownership → no cost → no care. Works for wages not relationship → maps to "not for filthy lucre" (1 Pet 5:2). Failure = lack of covenant bond.

**Covenant structure**: Heb 13:20 — shepherd explicitly tied to "everlasting covenant." Ezek 34:25 — after one shepherd (v.23), God makes "covenant of peace." Gen 49:24 — shepherd + stone [ROCK=Covenant]. Shepherd feeds covenant TRUTH, leads on covenant WAY (Ps 23:3 "paths of righteousness"), protects covenant people. When shepherds break trust → God intervenes directly (Ezek 34:11) → appoints one true Shepherd (Ezek 34:23, John 10:16). Christ = covenant mediator (Heb 8:6) = good shepherd.
