## Context Bag

**H1698 (deber)**: ~50 OT occurrences. BDB: plague, pestilence. Root דבר same consonants as "word" (dabar) — deber/dabar connection: pestilence is the anti-Word, death where Word is absent. LXX renders θάνατος (thanatos=death) most often, also λοιμός (loimos). G3061 λοιμός in NT: Lk13:11 variant, Acts24:5 (Paul called "pestilent"), Matt24:7/Lk21:11.

**TRIAD PATTERN**: Pestilence almost NEVER alone. Appears in fixed triad: SWORD+FAMINE+PESTILENCE (Jer 14:12, 21:7-9, 24:10, 27:8,13, 29:17-18, 32:24,36, 34:17, 38:2, 42:17,22, 44:13; Eze 5:12, 6:11-12, 7:15, 12:16, 14:21, 33:27). Sword=external violence, Famine=Word-withdrawal, Pestilence=direct covenant death. Three escalating covenant curses.

**KEY CLUSTERS**:
- **Lev26:25** — Covenant curse chapter. Pestilence sent INTO covenant community after disobedience. ROLE: God's direct agent.
- **Num14:12** — God threatens pestilence after spies' unbelief; refusing to enter=covenant refusal.
- **Deut28:21** — Covenant curse list. Pestilence clings until consumed off the land.
- **2Sam24:13-15** — David's census; 3 days pestilence chosen; 70,000 die. Angel with sword at threshing floor. MOUNTAIN (Moriah).
- **2Chr7:13-14** — Solomon's temple dedication. "If I send pestilence...if my people humble..." Remedy=repentance.
- **Psa78:50, 91:3,6** — Ps91: delivered FROM pestilence=covenant faithfulness shield. Ps78: Egypt judgment.
- **Hab3:5** — "Before him went pestilence" — personified, marches with God in theophany judgment.
- **Eze14:19-21** — Four judgments: sword, famine, beasts, pestilence. Only Noah/Daniel/Job escape by righteousness.
- **Eze38:22** — Gog judgment: pestilence+blood+rain+hailstones.
- **Jer14:12** — "When they fast, I will not hear...I will consume them by sword, famine, pestilence." Prayer rejected; Word-channel closed → pestilence follows.

**NT**: Matt24:7/Lk21:11 — λοιμοί (pestilences) listed with FAMINE, EARTHQUAKE, WARS/RUMORS, NATION-AGAINST-NATION. All BIRTH PAINS context. Olivet Discourse=covenant dissolution signs. Acts24:5 — Paul called λοιμός (pestilent fellow)=metaphorical, one who disrupts established order.

**Rev6:8** — Pale horse: θάνατος (death/pestilence per LXX equivalence) + sword + famine + beasts = Eze14:21 exact tetrad. Confirms LXX thanatos=deber link.

**CLUSTER**: Overwhelmingly clusters around COVENANT VIOLATION JUDGMENT, esp. Jeremiah (Babylon exile) and Ezekiel (temple departure). Historical cycle: primarily Kingdom→Exile.

**CONSISTENT READING**: Pestilence = God's direct covenant death-judgment sent when His Word (BREAD/FAMINE) is refused and covenant is broken (SWORD=violence, FAMINE=Word-absence, PESTILENCE=lethal consequence). Not random disease — targeted, covenantal, reversible by repentance (2Chr7:14).

**ANOMALIES**: Acts24:5 metaphorical use — Paul as "pestilence" to Roman order; inverts: faithful covenant-keeper perceived as disruption. Ps91 — pestilence as something righteous ESCAPE, confirming covenant-loyalty = exemption.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE**: Hebrew דֶּבֶר (deber) shares root with דָּבָר (dabar/word) — pestilence is the dark mirror of Word. LXX obscures this by rendering θάνατος. Greek λοιμός carries no Word-connection. The deber/dabar link visible ONLY in Hebrew.
