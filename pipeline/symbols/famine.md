## Context Bag

**DEFINING:** Amos 8:11 — "not famine of bread…but of hearing the words of YHWH." Direct decode: famine=Word-withdrawal. Deut 8:3 — hunger in wilderness → teaches man lives by every word from God's mouth. Hunger/famine=absence of Word, resolved by Word.

**H7458 (raʿab):** BDB: hunger, famine. Cognate raʿeb=hungry. LXX renders λιμός (G3042). Consistent mapping H→G.

**G3042 (limos):** hunger, famine, scarcity. NT usage: Matt 24:7, Luke 15:14-17, Rev 6:8, Rev 18:8, Rom 8:35, 2Cor 11:27.

**OCCURRENCES COMPRESSED:**
- **Gen 12:10; 26:1; 41-43** — Abram/Isaac/Jacob driven to foreign lands by famine. Pattern: covenant holders leave covenant land when Word absent → tested. Co-occur: NATION, LAND.
- **Ruth 1:1** — Famine in Bethlehem ("house of bread") → Elimelech leaves. Irony: bread-house has no bread=Word withdrawn from covenant place.
- **2Sam 21:1; 24:13** — Famine as covenant-curse option. David inquires of YHWH → famine traced to covenant violation (Saul/Gibeonites). Role: judgment descriptor.
- **1Kgs 18:2** — Famine in Samaria during Baal worship. Elijah=Word-bearer; his absence=famine. Word returns → rain returns. Co-occur: IDOLATRY, HARLOT.
- **Jer 11:22; 14:12-16; 24:10; 29:17-18; 42:16-17** — Triad: sword+famine+pestilence. Always covenant-judgment for disobedience. ~30x in Jeremiah. Co-occur: PESTILENCE, BABYLON.
- **Ezek 5:12-17; 6:11-12; 14:21** — Same triad. Four judgments: sword, famine, wild beasts, pestilence. Co-occur: ANIMAL, PESTILENCE.
- **Lam 4:9; 5:10** — Famine worse than sword. Skin black like oven=burning for bread/Word.
- **Matt 24:7; Mk 13:8; Lk 21:11** — Olivet: famines+earthquakes=beginning of birth pains. Co-occur: BIRTH PAINS, EARTHQUAKE, NATION AGAINST NATION, WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS.
- **Lk 15:14** — Prodigal: famine in far country → feeds pigs → returns to father's house (=bread). Word absent outside father's house.
- **Rev 6:5-8** — Third seal: scales/wheat/barley pricing. Fourth seal: Death+Hades kill by sword, famine, pestilence, beasts. Full Ezek 14:21 pattern. Co-occur: ANIMAL, PESTILENCE.
- **Rev 18:8** — Babylon's plagues: death, mourning, famine. Co-occur: BABYLON.
- **Rom 8:35** — Famine cannot separate from Christ's love=Word endures.

**CLUSTER:** Famine clusters around (1) covenant-judgment contexts, (2) triad sword/famine/pestilence, (3) testing of covenant holders, (4) Olivet signs.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Famine = God's Word/covenant instruction withdrawn or absent. Physical hunger mirrors spiritual emptiness. Amos 8:11 is the Rosetta Stone. Every narrative famine tests whether covenant holder seeks Word or turns elsewhere.

**ANOMALIES:** Joseph's Egypt famine — apparently natural, but Joseph=Word-interpreter; only through him is bread/provision. Famine drives nations TO the Word-holder.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7458→LXX λιμός→G3042 seamless. Deut 8:3→Matt 4:4 (Jesus quotes in wilderness hunger). Ezek 14:21→Rev 6:8 (four judgments).

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** Hebrew raʿab shares root pattern with raʿ (evil/calamity) — phonetic echo linking famine to covenant curse.
