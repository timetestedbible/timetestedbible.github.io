## Context Bag

**LEXICAL CHAIN:** H5377 (nasha') = beguile/deceive by false promise; H8582 (ta'ah) = wander/stray from path; BDB domains overlap: both = deviation from established course. LXX renders H8582 → G4105 (planao) consistently. G4105 = cause to wander, lead off-road. Root metaphor: PATH-DEPARTURE. H8582 "compare" → H7686 (shagah, err), H7683 (inadvertent sin). All three form semantic cluster: deviation from Torah-path.

**CLUSTER:** Overwhelmingly clusters around false prophets/leaders misrepresenting God's commands, causing covenant people to depart THE WAY. Always covenant-context.

**CONSISTENT READING:** DECEIVE = cause covenant departure by misrepresenting God's commands. Not mere lying — specifically redirecting allegiance away from Torah/covenant terms toward IDOLATRY. The path metaphor (H8582→G4105) confirms: deceive = lead off THE WAY.

**ANOMALIES:** Eze 14:9 — God Himself deceives; fits as judicial action: those seeking idols get confirmed in error. Obad 1:3 — pride self-deceives; reflexive form, same pattern (self-led off path).

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H8582(ta'ah)→LXX G4105(planao)→NT G4105. Perfect chain. "Planet" from planao = wandering star (Jude 13). Same root: deviation from fixed course.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H8582 root = physical wandering (Gen 21:14 Hagar); metaphor builds from literal path-loss to covenant path-loss. Greek planao preserves this spatial metaphor exactly.
