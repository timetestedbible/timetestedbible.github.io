**SCROLL CHAIN — Written Both Sides:**
Ezek 2:9-10: Roll written within/without "lamentations, mourning, woe" → prophet eats = internalize judgment word
Rev 5:1: Book written within/backside, sealed 7 seals → opening unleashes judgment sequence (seals→trumpets→bowls)
Zech 5:1-4: Flying roll curse "this side/that side" → global range → enters houses → consumes timber + stones
Pattern: All written both sides → contain judgment/curse → both sides = totality covenant judgment

**PHYSICAL SPECS (Zech 5:1-4):**
H4039 megillah = cylindrical scroll
H5774 uph = fly/cover with wings/obscurity → derivatives: darkness/dimness
Dimensions: 20×10 cubits ≈ 30ft×15ft
Global range: "face of whole earth"
H423 alah = covenant oath-curse
Consumes H6086 timber + H68 stones = both organic/inorganic ≠ normal fire → extreme thermal

**WICKEDNESS PAYLOAD (Zech 5:5-11):**
Woman = H7564 rish'ah = WICKEDNESS/lawlessness
Container: H374 ephah = measuring vessel
Sealed: H5777 ophereth = LEAD (from H6080 dust/grey) = radiation shielding
H4369 mekunah = base/pedestal/platform in Shinar (Babylon)
Transport: 2 winged women + H7307 ruach wind

**CONNECTIONS:**
Flying scroll = delivery mechanism || woman-in-ephah = payload (wickedness itself)
Wickedness: originates Babylon (Rev 17:5) → returns Babylon (Zech 5:11) as judgment
Ezek 28:18: fire "from midst of thee" = system generates own destruction
Lead sealing = containment dangerous material during transport
"Set on base" = permanent installation/launch platform

**SWORD-SCROLL PARALLEL (Isa 34:4-5):**
Flying scroll (Zech 5) = sword bathed heaven (Isa 34:5) SAME concept different angles
Both: fly through sky → carry covenant-curse → produce fire/desolation → global scale
Sequence: heavens roll as scroll (v4) → sword bathed heaven descends (v5)
The scroll IS what rolls when sword descends = same event 2 perspectives

**CHEREM PROTOCOL:**
Isa 34:5 curse = H2764 cherem = total destruction/the ban ≠ Zech 5:3 H423 alah but same operation
Mal 4:6: Last OT word — threatens EARTH with cherem
Zech 14:11: "no more cherem" restored Jerusalem
Chain: Mal 4:6 threat → Isa 34:5 sword delivers → Zech 5:3 scroll carries → Rev 6-18 executes

**SWORD = DESOLATION:**
H2719 chereb (sword) ← H2717 charab = parch/desolate/destroy
H2722 Choreb (HOREB/Sinai) = same root → covenant-giving place = covenant-judgment weapon name
Word = sword = fire = desolation

**FIRE FROM SWORD:**
Gen 3:24: First weapon = H3858 lahat (blaze+enwrapping) + H2719 chereb + H2015 haphak (transforms)
Fire-wrapped desolation transforms everything contacted
Sword consistently → fire: Josh 11:11, Judg 1:8, 18:27, 20:48, Ezek 23:25,47

**LITERAL OBSERVATION:**
Ancient vocabulary describing modern systems: cylindrical flying object = scroll, exterior markings = "written both sides", destructive payload = "curse", consumes wood+stone = thermal beyond combustion, lead-sealed = radiation shielding, pedestal = launch platform
