## Context Bag

STUB — needs full study.

Key elements identified:

**SCROLL CHAIN — Written on Both Sides:**
1. Ezek 2:9-10 — Roll written within and without: "lamentations, mourning, woe." Given to prophet to eat = internalize the judgment word.
2. Rev 5:1 — Book written within and on backside, sealed with seven seals. Opening = unleashing judgment sequence (seals → trumpets → bowls).
3. Zech 5:1-4 — Flying roll with curse on "this side" and "that side." Goes over whole earth. Enters houses. Consumes timber AND stones.

All three: written on both sides. All three: contain judgment/curse content. The "both sides" = totality of covenant judgment — thief on one side, false swearer on the other (Zech 5:3) = comprehensive — no escape from either direction.

**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION (Zech 5:1-4):**
- H4039 megillah = roll/scroll (cylindrical when rolled)
- H5774 uph = to fly, to cover with wings/obscurity. Derivatives include darkness/dimness (H4155, H5890).
- Dimensions: 20 cubits × 10 cubits ≈ 30ft × 15ft
- Goes over face of whole earth (global range)
- H423 alah = curse/imprecation (covenant oath-curse)
- Enters houses and CONSUMES them with H6086 timber AND H68 stones — both organic and inorganic material destroyed. Abnormal for fire — suggests extreme thermal energy.

**WOMAN IN EPHAH (Zech 5:5-11) — THE PAYLOAD:**
- H374 ephah = measuring container
- Woman = H7564 rish'ah = WICKEDNESS (= lawlessness/covenant transgression)
- Sealed with H5777 ophereth = LEAD (from H6080 = dust/grey). Lead = radiation shielding material.
- H4369 mekunah = base/pedestal/platform = "set there upon her own base" in Shinar (Babylon)
- Transported between earth and heaven by two winged women with wind (H7307 ruach) in their wings

**CONNECTIONS:**
- Flying scroll DELIVERS the curse; woman-in-ephah IS the payload (wickedness itself)
- Wickedness originates from Babylon (Rev 17:5 mother of abominations) → returns to Babylon (Zech 5:11) as judgment
- Ezek 28:18 "fire FROM THE MIDST of thee" = system generates its own destruction
- Lead sealing = containment of something dangerous that must not leak during transport
- "Established on her own base" = permanently installed infrastructure

**LITERAL-FULFILLMENT OBSERVATION:**
Ancient writers describing modern weapon systems would use available vocabulary: cylindrical flying object = roll/scroll. Markings on exterior = "written on both sides." Destructive payload = "curse." Consumes wood AND stone = extreme thermal energy beyond combustion. Lead-sealed container = radiation shielding. Set on pedestal/base = launch platform/silo. Global range = "over face of whole earth."

**SWORD BATHED IN HEAVEN (Isa 34:5) — PARALLEL DELIVERY MECHANISM:**
The flying scroll (Zech 5) and the sword bathed in heaven (Isa 34:5) describe the SAME concept from different angles:
- Flying scroll = covenant-curse document that flies over the earth → enters houses → consumes timber AND stones
- Sword bathed in heaven = weapon saturated in sky/space → comes DOWN → on people of the cherem (H2764, total destruction)
Both: fly through the sky, carry covenant-curse payload, produce fire/desolation, operate at global scale.

Isa 34:4-5 sequence: heavens roll up as scroll (v4) → sword bathed in heaven comes down (v5). The scroll IS what rolls up when the sword descends. The atmospheric displacement (scroll rolling) and the weapon's descent are the SAME EVENT from two perspectives.

**H2764 CHEREM — THE CURSE ON THE SWORD:**
The "curse" in Isa 34:5 = H2764 cherem (total destruction, devoted thing, the ban). Different word from Zech 5:3 H423 alah (oath-curse), but same operational concept. Cherem = the most severe covenant judgment — everything destroyed, nothing spared.
- Mal 4:6: LAST WORD of OT — "lest I smite the EARTH with a cherem." Threatens the ENTIRE EARTH with the total-destruction protocol.
- Zech 14:11: "no more cherem" in restored Jerusalem. The ban era ends.
- The cherem chain: Mal 4:6 (threat) → Isa 34:5 (sword delivers it) → Zech 5:3 (scroll carries it) → Rev 6-18 (it executes).

**SWORD ROOT = DESOLATION:**
H2719 chereb (sword) from H2717 charab = to parch, desolate, destroy. The sword IS the desolation-maker. H2722 Choreb (HOREB/Sinai) = same root. The place of covenant-giving shares its name with the instrument of covenant-judgment. Word = sword = fire = desolation.

**FIRE FROM SWORD:**
Gen 3:24: flaming (H3858 lahat = blaze + enwrapping) sword (H2719 chereb) that turns every way (H2015 haphak = overturns/transforms). First weapon in Scripture = fire-wrapped desolation that transforms everything it contacts. Sword consistently produces fire: Josh 11:11, Judg 1:8, 18:27, 20:48, Ezek 23:25,47.

QUEUE: Full context-integrate needed for Zech 5:1-11. Cross-reference with Rev 5-6 seal-opening sequence, Isa 34:1-17, and Mal 4:6. Search for other "flying" objects in Scripture. Study H5774 derivative meanings (darkness, dimness, swooning). Study H2764 cherem exhaustively — every occurrence of the total-destruction protocol.
