## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H4039 megillah (from H1556 galal = roll) = cylindrical scroll. 21× OT: Ps 40:7 (1×), Jer 36 (14×), Ezek 2-3 (4×), Zech 5 (2×). H5774 uph = cover with wings/obscurity → fly; faint from dimness. Derivatives: H5775 oph = bird; H5777 ophereth = LEAD (from H6080 aphar = dust). H5612 sepher = writing/book/scroll (most common scroll word). G975 biblion = roll/scroll (NT). G974 bibliaridion = little book (Rev 10 only).

**ZECH 5:1-4 — DEFINING:** Flying roll (H5774+H4039), 20×10 cubits (~30×15ft). IS the H423 alah (covenant oath-curse) over face of whole earth. Two sides: thieves cut off THIS side, false swearers THAT side. Enters houses, H3885 lun (lodges/remains overnight), H3615 kalah (consumes) H6086 timber + H68 stones. co: CURSE. role: judgment-delivery. Key: consumes organic + inorganic = beyond normal combustion.

**ZECH 5:5-11 — PAYLOAD:** Woman = H7564 rish'ah (WICKEDNESS). Container: H374 ephah (measuring vessel). Sealed: H3603 talent H5777 ophereth (LEAD, from H6080 dust). Transport: 2 winged women + H7307 ruach wind → H8152 Shinar (Babylon). Set on H4369 mekunah (base/pedestal). co: WICKEDNESS, BABYLON, LEAD. Flying scroll = delivery mechanism || woman-in-ephah = payload. Wickedness originates Babylon → returns Babylon as judgment.

**EZEK 2:9-3:3 — EATEN:** Roll (H4039+H5612) written within AND without = lamentations + mourning + woe. Prophet eats → sweet as honey in mouth. Then commissioned to speak to rebellious Israel. co: PROPHET, WORD. Both-sides = totality; no blank space = no escape clause. Internalization = prophet becomes the message.

**REV 5:1-9 — SEALED:** Book (G975) written within + backside, sealed 7 seals. Only Lamb worthy to open. Opening → unleashes seals→trumpets→bowls judgment sequence. co: LAMB, SEAL. The scroll IS the complete covenant judgment; opening = executing.

**REV 10:2-10 — LITTLE BOOK:** G974 bibliaridion, OPEN in angel's hand. Prophet eats = sweet mouth then bitter belly. "Must prophesy again." Direct parallel: Ezek eating scroll. Sweet (righteousness) → bitter (judgment execution on people).

**REV 6:14 — HEAVEN AS SCROLL:** Heaven departed as G975 scroll rolled together. co: EARTHQUAKE, MOUNTAIN moved. Heavens = scroll being unrolled/read = judgment being executed.

**ISA 34:4-5 — SCROLL→SWORD:** Heavens rolled as scroll → sword H7301 ravah (saturated) in heaven descends on H2764 cherem people. co: SWORD, FIRE, DESOLATION. Same event as Zech 5 from different angle: sky-object carries covenant curse downward → total destruction.

**JER 36 — INDESTRUCTIBLE:** Jeremiah's roll of judgment burned by Jehoiakim (cut with penknife, cast in fire H784 on hearth). God commands: rewrite + ADD MORE words (v32). co: FIRE, BABYLON (v29: king of Babylon SHALL come). Burning the decree accelerates it. Word cannot be destroyed (Isa 55:11).

**DEUT 29:20-21 — LAW FOUNDATION:** All curses (H423) written in this book (H5612) lie upon covenant-breaker. H423+H5612 = flying scroll prototype in law. Dan 9:11: curse (H423) POURED upon Israel, oath WRITTEN in law of Moses. Isa 24:6: curse (H423) DEVOURED the earth, inhabitants BURNED. Num 5:23: sotah — curses (H423) written in book (H5612), blotted into bitter water → enters woman → body judges itself.

**PS 40:7/HEB 10:7 — CHRIST:** "In volume (H4039 megillah / G2777 kephalis) of book it is written of ME." Christ IS what the scroll contains. Lamb opens scroll because He IS the scroll's content.

**PROV 26:2 — FLYING+CURSE:** "Swallow by flying (H5774), curse causeless shall not come." Same H5774 as Zech 5:1. Flying + curse linked outside Zechariah.

**PATTERNS:**
1. WRITTEN BOTH SIDES: Ezek 2:10 (within+without) = Rev 5:1 (within+backside) = Zech 5:3 (this side/that side). Totality of covenant judgment — complete, irreversible.
2. SCROLL EXECUTES, NOT MERELY RECORDS: Zech 5 roll flies+enters+consumes. Rev 5 opening seals RELEASES judgments. The written Word acts.
3. EATEN = INTERNALIZED: Ezek 3:1-3 = Rev 10:9-10. Sweet then bitter. Prophet becomes the message. Word = fire in bones (Jer 20:9).
4. INDESTRUCTIBLE DECREE: Jer 36 burning → rewrite + more words. Isa 55:11 word shall not return void.
5. DELIVERY + PAYLOAD: Zech 5 two visions = one system. Scroll (mechanism) carries curse; ephah (container) holds wickedness. Wickedness returns to its origin (Babylon/Shinar). Self-consumption: Ezek 28:18 fire from midst of thee.
6. SCROLL↔SWORD: Isa 34:4-5 heavens-as-scroll → sword-from-heaven. Both fly through sky, carry covenant-curse, produce fire/desolation, operate globally. Root H2719 chereb = desolation-maker. Word = sword = scroll = fire.
7. CHEREM CHAIN: Isa 34:5 H2764 cherem (total destruction) || Zech 5:3 H423 alah (covenant curse) = different words, same operation. Mal 4:6 threatens earth with H2764 cherem (last OT word). Zech 14:11 "no more cherem" = restoration.
8. OPPOSITE SCROLL: Book of Life (Rev 20:12, 21:27) preserves; judgment scroll (Zech 5/Rev 5) condemns. Both G975 biblion. Same format, opposite function.
