## Context Bag

### LEXICAL ROOT — RAVEN = DARKNESS

**H6158 oreb** = raven. From **H6150 arab** = "to grow dusky at sundown." The raven is named for DARKNESS — the dusk-bird, the evening-creature.

Root family reveals the raven's symbolic ecosystem:
- H6150 arab = grow dusky → EVENING / DARKNESS
- H6153 ereb = dusk, evening, night-onset
- **H6154 ereb = MIXTURE, mixed multitude, mongrel race** (from H6148 arab = to intermix/exchange) — the evening is when things MIX, distinctions blur
- **H6160 arabah = DESERT, sterility, wilderness** — barren land from the darkness-root
- H6152 Arab = Arabia (the region of sterility/evening)
- **H4628 ma'arab = THE WEST** (region of evening sun) — where the sun goes DOWN

The raven carries: darkness + mixture + desert/sterility + evening/endings. It is the bird of the fading light, the creature at home where distinctions blur and fruitfulness dies.

### OCCURRENCES

**Gen 8:7** — Noah sends raven from ark. It "went forth to and fro" (H3318 yatsa + H7725 shub = going out and returning) until waters dried. CRITICAL: the raven NEVER RETURNS to the ark. It stays out roaming over the judgment-world. It's at home among the dead. Contrast DOVE (Gen 8:8-12): sent second, finds NO REST (H4494 manoach), RETURNS to ark. Dove is NOT at home in the judgment-world. Dove eventually brings olive leaf = sign of life returning.

**RAVEN vs. DOVE = BABYLON vs. JERUSALEM:** The raven is at home in death/judgment/desolation. The dove seeks rest and returns to covenant safety. The raven = the spirit that thrives in Babylon's wreckage. The dove = the spirit that returns to God's ark.

**Lev 11:15 / Deut 14:14** — UNCLEAN bird. Forbidden food. Part of the "dark" category.

**1 Ki 17:4,6** — God commands RAVENS to feed Elijah bread and flesh, morning and evening (H6153 ereb — the raven's own root-word!). The unclean bird sustains the prophet during drought-judgment. God uses Babylon's instrument to sustain His servant — just as He used Nebuchadnezzar as His tool against Judah. The brook is **Cherith** (H3747 from H3772 karath = to CUT, to make a COVENANT — also the word for covenant-cutting!). Elijah fed by the raven at the brook of Cutting/Covenant.

**Job 38:41 / Ps 147:9** — God feeds the raven and its young. Even the creature of darkness is sustained by God's provision. The raven doesn't sow or reap (Luke 12:24) — it scavenges. God provides for scavengers.

**Prov 30:17** — "The eye that mocketh at his father... the ravens of the valley shall pick it out." Ravens eat the eyes of the covenant-breaker. They consume the disobedient.

**Isa 34:11** — "The raven shall dwell in it" — in DESTROYED IDUMEA, the land of the CHEREM (Isa 34:5). After the sword bathed in heaven destroys the land → raven inhabits the ruins. The raven is AT HOME in the post-cherem wasteland, just as it was at home over the post-flood waters. The raven = creature that THRIVES in desolation. Note: same verse has "line of CONFUSION (H8414 tohu), stones of EMPTINESS (H922 bohu)" — Gen 1:2 language! The cherem returns the land to pre-creation chaos. The raven dwells in tohu va-bohu.

**Luke 12:24** — Jesus: "Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them." Ravens don't participate in agricultural economy (sowing/reaping = covenant work). They live outside the system. Yet God feeds them. A lesson about provision that transcends human economic systems.

### NEBUCHADNEZZAR = THE RAVEN-KING (Dan 4)

Nebuchadnezzar, king of BABYLON, is reduced to beast-state for 7 times (seven years = complete covenant cycle):
- The great TREE (= nation/kingdom, Dan 4:22) is hewn down — TREE→stump
- He eats GRASS (= people, Isa 40:6-7) as oxen — he CONSUMES people
- His body wet with DEW of heaven — exposed to the elements
- His hair grows like EAGLES' feathers (H5403 neshar) — he becomes BIRD-LIKE
- His nails like BIRDS' claws (H6853 tsippar) — transformed into a creature of the air
- He lives among BEASTS of the field — outside human civilization
- He roams the open field — going to and fro like the raven

Nebuchadnezzar becomes a RAVEN-FIGURE: the king of Babylon transformed into a dark, scavenging, bird-like creature roaming the field, eating grass (consuming people), dwelling in desolation for 7 times. He IS the raven — Babylon's ruler reduced to what Babylon's spirit actually is: a restless, consuming darkness that feeds among the dead.

**The restoration (Dan 4:34-37):** At the end of 7 times, Nebuchadnezzar "lifted up mine eyes unto HEAVEN, and mine understanding returned." He acknowledges God's rule. He is RESTORED to his kingdom. Key: Babylon CAN be restored if its ruler acknowledges heaven's authority. This is the EGYPT pattern (Isa 19:22 "he shall smite and HEAL"). Babylon-the-system cannot be healed (Rev 18), but Babylon-the-PERSON can — if they turn (Dan 4:34).

### SATAN AS RAVEN-PATTERN

Job 1:7, 2:2 — Satan "going to and fro (H7751 shut) in the earth, walking up and down in it." Same restless roaming as the raven (Gen 8:7). Satan patrols the judgment-world, seeking to devour (1 Pet 5:8 "as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour").

1 Pet 5:8 uses G4043 peripateo (walk about) — same concept as H7751. The adversary ROAMS. Never at rest. Never returns to covenant-rest.

### TO-AND-FRO PATTERN

H7751 shut = "to push forth; figuratively to lash, to row; to travel." KJV: go about, through, to and fro, mariner, rower.

**Derivative: H7752 shot = a LASH, SCOURGE, WHIP.** The to-and-fro motion IS a whipping/scourging. Going to and fro = the movement of judgment.

**Who goes to and fro:**
| Agent | Verse | Action |
|---|---|---|
| RAVEN | Gen 8:7 | Roams over judgment-flooded world, never returns |
| SATAN | Job 1:7, 2:2 | Roams the earth seeking to devour |
| GOD'S EYES | 2Chr 16:9, Zech 4:10 | Searches whole earth for faithful hearts |
| TYRE'S ROWERS | Ezek 27:8,26 | Navigate the SEA (nations) for commerce → broken by east wind |
| SEARCHERS | Jer 5:1 | Run to and fro in Jerusalem seeking one righteous man |
| END-TIMES MANY | Dan 12:4 | Run to and fro, knowledge increases — at the TIME OF THE END |
| HORSEMEN | Zech 6:7 | Walk to and fro through the earth = God's patrol agents |

**Dan 12:4 KEY:** "Many shall run to and fro (H7751), and knowledge shall be increased." At the time of the end — the sealed book is opened, people travel the earth extensively, and knowledge multiplies. This is the END-TIMES signature of the to-and-fro pattern: global travel + information explosion. The raven's behavior becomes humanity's behavior at the close of the age.

### RAVEN + THORNS + CHEREM = Isa 34:11-13

In the cherem-judged land:
- v11: Raven DWELLS there + "line of confusion (tohu), stones of emptiness (bohu)" — pre-creation chaos
- v13: "THORNS shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses"

After the sword bathed in heaven executes the cherem: ravens (darkness-creatures) inhabit + thorns (worldly cursed people) overrun. The post-judgment landscape = tohu va-bohu + ravens + thorns. The raven and the thorns TOGETHER characterize what remains after Babylon falls.

QUEUE: Full symbol-study needs exhaustive search of all H6158/G2876 occurrences. Context-integrate needed for Gen 8:1-22 (raven vs dove), Dan 4:1-37 (Nebuchadnezzar's beast-period), 1Ki 17:1-24 (Elijah at Cherith).
