## Context Bag

**OCCURRENCES:**

**Ps 90:4** — SUBJECT: God's eternality vs human mortality. SCENE: Moses prayer; 1000yrs in God's sight = yesterday/night watch. CO-OCC: NIGHT, SLEEP, GRASS (v5-6). ROLE: descriptor of God's time-perspective. TYPE: psalm. SPEAKER: Moses. CYCLE: Wilderness. DETAIL: "night watch" = ⅓ of night; 1000yrs compressed further. Links mortality (v3 "return to dust" = Gen 3:19) to covenant curse.

**2Pet 3:8** — SUBJECT: Promise of Christ's return not delayed. SCENE: Peter refutes scoffers saying "where is promise of coming?" CO-OCC: RETURN OF CHRIST, DAYS OF NOAH (v5-6), SUDDEN DESTRUCTION (v10), DAY (v10,12), THE END (v10-13), DARKNESS implied. ROLE: descriptor — reframes "delay." TYPE: discourse/apocalyptic. SPEAKER: Peter. CYCLE: Rome. DETAIL: Bidirectional — 1 day=1000yrs AND 1000yrs=1 day. Links to v9: "not slow concerning promise" = covenant faithfulness. Scoffers' error = measuring God's covenant timeline by human time.

**2Pet 3:9** — Continuation: "delay" = patience toward repentance. CO-OCC: BELIEVE (repentance=covenant return), SUDDEN DESTRUCTION (v10). God's 1000-yr "days" are mercy-windows.

**Gen 2:17** — IMPLICIT: "in the day you eat…you shall die." Adam lived 930 yrs (Gen 5:5) — died within God's 1000-yr "day." CO-OCC: TREE, FRUIT, TRUTH, DECEIVE (ch3). TYPE: narrative-law. SPEAKER: YHWH. CYCLE: Creation. This is the SEED passage — first covenant threat executed on God's timescale, not man's.

**Rev 20:2-4,6-7** — SUBJECT: Satan bound 1000yrs; saints reign 1000yrs. SCENE: Apocalyptic throne/judgment. CO-OCC: MOUNTAIN (kingdom), MARK (v4), HARLOT/BABYLON (prior ch), RETURN OF CHRIST (19:11ff). TYPE: apocalyptic. SPEAKER: Angel/John. CYCLE: Consummation. DETAIL: "1000 years" 6× in Rev 20 — one covenant "day" of reign, then final judgment.

**CLUSTER:** Occurrences cluster around covenant accountability timing — God's "day" of promise/threat operates at 1000-yr scale. Always appears when humans question God's timing (scoffers, mortality, death-threat "delay").

**CONSISTENT READING:** God's covenant operates on His timescale (1 day=1000yrs). What appears as "delay" to humans IS the covenant day still running. Adam died "in the day" = within 1000yrs. Christ's return "delay" = still within God's "day." Rev 20's 1000yrs = one covenant-day of reign before final judgment.

**ANOMALIES:** Rev 20 could be literal duration OR symbolic covenant-day. Text doesn't force either — both align with meaning. Gen 2:17 strongest anomaly: requires this principle to resolve apparent contradiction (Adam didn't die "that day" humanly).

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H3117 (yom) → LXX uses G2250 (hēmera) in Ps 89:4 LXX (=90:4 MT). Peter quotes Ps 90:4 directly, preserving hēmera. Same word-chain Creation→Psalm→Epistle→Apocalypse.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** Hebrew yom carries both "daylight period" and "era/epoch" (BDB semantic range). Greek hēmera mirrors this. The 1000-yr equation exploits this dual range — God's "day" (epoch) = human millennium.

**KEY LINK:** Gen 2:17 → Ps 90:4 → 2Pet 3:8 → Rev 20. Single interpretive chain: covenant death-threat → covenant timescale revealed → covenant patience explained → covenant reign measured.
