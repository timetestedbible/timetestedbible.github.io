name: NORTH
strongs: [H6828, H6830]
words: ["north", "northern", "northward", "north parts", "north country", "north side", "north wind"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: The hidden direction — the quarter from which concealed judgment and God's throne-presence both approach. H6828 tsaphown from H6845 tsaphan (to hide/treasure/store up). North = literally "the hidden/dark quarter." What comes from the north is what you did not see coming. Dual function: God's glory approaches from concealment (Ezek 1:4) AND God's judgment approaches from concealment (Jer 1:14). Both operate from hiddenness.
opposite: SOUTH (H5045 negeb = parched/dry/visible; H8486 teman = right hand when facing east = the known/open direction)

**H6828 tsaphown** = "properly, HIDDEN, i.e. dark; used only of the north as a quarter (gloomy and unknown)." From **H6845 tsaphan** = "to hide (by covering over); by implication, to hoard or reserve; figuratively to deny; specifically to protect, to lurk." Root = CONCEALMENT. The north is literally "the hidden direction." H4710 mitspun (from H6845) = "a secret/hidden thing." H6840 tsaphiyn (from H6845) = "a treasure (as hidden)." Even Zephaniah (H6846) = "Jah has secreted." The entire word-family = what is stored, concealed, treasured in darkness.

## Context Bag

**A. GOD'S THRONE ON THE NORTH:**
Ps 48:2 — Mount Zion on "sides of the NORTH{H6828}" = city of the great King. co: THRONE. God's dwelling = the hidden quarter. Isa 14:13 — Lucifer: "I will sit upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the NORTH{H6828}" — aspires to USURP God's hidden throne-seat. co: THRONE, PRIDE. The north is contested territory: God's seat of authority that the adversary covets. Job 26:7 — "He stretcheth out the NORTH{H6828} over the empty place{H8414 tohu}, hangeth the earth upon nothing." North = stretched over the VOID. The hidden direction covers the formless place. Cosmological: God's authority over chaos.

**B. GOD'S GLORY FROM THE NORTH:**
Ezek 1:4 — whirlwind from the NORTH, great cloud, fire infolding, brightness, amber from midst of fire. THRONE-VISION approaches from H6828. co: FIRE, CLOUD, THRONE. God's glory comes from the hidden direction. Ezek 8:3,5 — image of jealousy at north gate of temple. Ezek 8:14 — women weeping for Tammuz at north gate. Ezek 9:2 — six executioners come from the way of the NORTH gate. co: JUDGMENT. The north gate = both where abomination sits AND where God's judgment enters. Same gate, opposite traffic.

**C. JEREMIAH'S "EVIL FROM THE NORTH" — JUDAH-DESTROYER CLUSTER:**
Jer 1:13-15 — seething pot facing from north + evil from north upon all inhabitants. Jer 4:6 — evil from the north, great destruction. Jer 6:1 — evil out of the north, great destruction. Jer 6:22 — people from the north country, great nation from sides of earth. Jer 10:22 — great commotion from north country → cities of Judah desolate, den of DRAGONS{H8577}. co: DRAGON. Jer 13:20 — "them that come from the north." Jer 25:9 — "all families of the north" + Nebuchadnezzar "my servant." Jer 46:20 — destruction of EGYPT comes from north. Jer 46:24 — Egypt delivered to "people of the north." Joel 2:20 — northern{H6830} army driven away. Pattern: Babylon = God's instrument approaching from the hidden direction. The instrument is hidden until it strikes = SNARE mechanism (Prov 1:17 visibility defeats the trap).

**D. JEREMIAH'S BABYLON-DESTROYER CLUSTER — SAME DIRECTION REVERSED:**
Jer 50:3 — "out of the NORTH cometh up a NATION against her [Babylon]." Jer 50:9 — "assembly of GREAT NATIONS from the north country." Jer 50:41 — "a people from the north, a great nation, and MANY KINGS." Jer 51:48 — "spoilers shall come unto her FROM THE NORTH." CRITICAL: the SAME "from the north" that destroyed JUDAH (Jer 1:14, 4:6, 6:1) now destroys BABYLON (Jer 50:3,41; 51:48). The instrument becomes the target. Same hidden direction, same concealed approach, reversed victim. Jer 50:44 — the Babylon-destroyer comes "like a LION." co: LION, FALL_OF_BABYLON. Jer 4:7 — the JUDAH-destroyer is also "a LION from his thicket." Same lion-identity, different target. The composite beast (Rev 13:2 = LION mouth + BEAR feet) IS the "nation from the north" at Babylon-the-Great scale (→ symbols/who-destroys-babylon).

**E. EZEKIEL'S GOG FROM THE NORTH:**
Ezek 38:6 — Gomer + Togarmah from "north quarters{H6828}." Ezek 38:15 — Gog from "thy place out of the NORTH PARTS{H3411+H6828}, thou and many people." Ezek 39:2 — "cause thee to come up from the NORTH PARTS." co: GOG, BEAST. The eschatological invasion approaches from the hidden direction. "Many people" = Jer 50:41 "many kings" — parallel language.

**F. DANIEL'S KING OF THE NORTH:**
Dan 11:6-15 — "king of the north" = sustained adversary of the south throughout chapter 11. Dan 11:40 — "king of the north shall come against him like a WHIRLWIND" (cf. Ezek 1:4 whirlwind from the north). Dan 11:44 — "tidings out of the east and out of the NORTH shall trouble him." co: BEAST. North = the hidden quarter from which disruption comes even to the final king.

**G. ZECHARIAH'S HORSES TO THE NORTH:**
Zech 6:6 — BLACK horses go to the north country; white after them. Zech 6:8 — "these that go toward the NORTH COUNTRY have quieted my SPIRIT{H7307 ruach}." co: FOUR_HORSEMEN, JUDGMENT. God's spirits/horsemen executing judgment in the north = satisfying God's justice. The hidden direction receives judgment that QUIETS divine wrath. Zech 2:6 — "flee from land of the north" = exile-return language.

**H. OTHER:**
Isa 14:31 — "from the north a SMOKE{H6227}." co: SMOKE. North produces smoke = darkening mechanism (→ symbols/smoke). The hidden direction generates the obscuring. Isa 41:25 — "I raised up one from the north, and he shall come." Cyrus = God's instrument from the hidden quarter. Prov 25:23 — north wind drives away rain; backbiting tongue = angry looks. Song 4:16 — "Awake, O north wind" — north wind invoked to spread fragrance.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **HIDDEN = ESSENCE.** H6828 from H6845 = concealment IS the north. Not merely a compass point — the direction where things are stored, treasured, lurking. Connects to SNARE (concealment = essence of snare, Prov 1:17). Judgment from the north = judgment from concealment = the trap you didn't see.
2. **DUAL USE — GLORY + JUDGMENT.** God's throne-presence (Ezek 1:4, Ps 48:2) AND God's destructive instruments (Jer 1:14, Jer 50:3) both come from the north. The hidden direction serves both functions because GOD operates from hiddenness (Isa 45:15 "thou art a God that hidest thyself").
3. **BOOMERANG — SAME DIRECTION, REVERSED TARGET.** Jer 1:14 north → destroys Judah. Jer 50:3 north → destroys Babylon. The executor becomes the executed, from the same quarter. God uses the same hidden approach against successive targets. The instrument never sees itself becoming the target.
4. **LION-FROM-THE-NORTH.** Jer 4:7 lion from thicket = nation from the north (Judah-destroyer). Jer 50:44 lion from Jordan = nation from the north (Babylon-destroyer). Rev 13:2 lion-mouth on composite beast = the "nation from the north" at eschatological scale. The lion always approaches from the hidden direction.
5. **NORTH GATE = CONTESTED THRESHOLD.** Ezek 8:3,14 abominations at the north gate. Ezek 9:2 executioners enter from the north gate. Ezek 44:4 God's glory via north gate. The north gate is where false worship installs itself AND where divine judgment enters — same door, opposite traffic.
6. **GOG + "MANY KINGS" = "NATION FROM THE NORTH" PATTERN.** Ezek 38:15 Gog from north parts with "many people" || Jer 50:41 nation from north with "many kings." Same structural template across Ezekiel and Jeremiah for the end-time northern invasion.
