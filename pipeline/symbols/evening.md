## Context Bag

**Core argument:** "Unclean until the even" → not sunset but evening sacrifice (~3pm/9th hour). What cleanses: blood atonement (Lev 17:11), not passage of time/darkness. עֶרֶב (erev, H6153) → sacrifice time.

**Evening sacrifice (תָּמִיד tamid) timing:** Exod 29:39, 41 — daily lamb "at even"; Num 28:4 — בֵּין הָעַרְבַּיִם "between the two evenings"; 1 Kgs 18:29, 36 — Elijah acts "at the time of the evening sacrifice." Historical records → ~9th hour (3pm).

**Uncleanness pattern:** Lev 11–15 + Num 19 — all uncleanness restored "until the even." Three-step process: (1) wash + water, (2) wait until evening (sacrifice time), (3) cleansed when offering made. Physical uncleanness → spiritual restoration through sacrifice. Darkness doesn't cleanse; lamb's blood does.

**Day structure implied:** Morning sacrifice → day's work → evening sacrifice → cleansed. Aligns with morning-start day where evening brings cleansing through sacrifice.

**Typology → Christ:** Jesus died at 9th hour (Matt 27:46) = exact time of evening sacrifice. Lamb of God (John 1:29) died at time of evening lamb. Apostles went to temple prayer at 9th hour (Acts 3:1). "Unclean until the even" → forward pointer to ultimate cleansing through His sacrifice. Blood provides atonement || all "unclean" cleansed through His offering.

**Daniel's 2300 "evenings and mornings":** Dan 8:14 — Heb. עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר (erev boqer) = "evening morning," not "days." Same vocabulary as daily sacrifices. Context: Dan 8:11 — daily [sacrifice] taken away; Dan 8:13 — how long…daily [sacrifice]…sanctuary trodden? Dan 8:14 → counts sacrifices, not days. 2300 evening-mornings = 1150 days missed sacrifices || ~3.5 years Antiochus Epiphanes' desecration. LXX (c. 250 BC) preserves literal "evening and morning" → translators understood sacrifice language. When evening → sacrifice, prophecy clarifies.

**Cross-refs:** SACRIFICE — evening offering as daily atonement; WASHING — physical cleansing before spiritual restoration; DAY — when does biblical day begin?
