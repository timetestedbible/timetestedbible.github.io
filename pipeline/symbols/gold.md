## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**H2091 zahab** — gold. ~385 OT occurrences. From unused root meaning to shimmer/glisten.
**G5557 chrysos / G5553 chrysion** — gold / gold article. ~30 NT occurrences.

**KEY THREADS TO TRACE:**
- Dan 2:32,38 — head of GOLD = Babylon = first/purest/most unified form of man's kingdom
- Exod 25-40 — tabernacle overlaid with gold = God's dwelling standard. Gold=divinity-contact material.
- Rev 3:18 — "buy of me gold tried in fire" = FAITH tested (1Pet 1:7 "trial of your faith, more precious than gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire")
- Rev 21:18,21 — New Jerusalem = pure gold, like clear glass. City of God IS gold.
- Mal 3:3 — refiner's fire purifies sons of Levi like gold/silver
- Isa 46:6 — gold/silver made into IDOLS. Dual valence: pure worship material OR counterfeit idol material.
- Rev 17:4 — Babylon harlot decked with gold = counterfeiting God's glory
- Gen 2:11-12 — Eden: "the gold of that land is good." Gold present at creation.
- Hag 2:8 — "The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith 𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄"

**PRODUCTION CHAIN:** Gold ore → refined by FIRE → pure gold. The refining IS the meaning: tested, proven, purified. Gold that hasn't been through fire is suspect.

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive search of H2091 + G5557/G5553. 7+ candidate meanings. Substitution tests. Dual-valence resolution (divine standard vs. idol material). Contrast with SILVER, IRON, BRASS, CLAY.
