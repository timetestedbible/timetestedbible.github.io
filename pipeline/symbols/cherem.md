## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H2763 charam (verb): "to seclude; specifically (by a ban) to devote to religious uses (especially destruction)." H2764 cherem (noun): "physical (as shutting in) a net; usually a doomed object; abstractly extermination." Root idea = ENCLOSURE/SECLUSION. Strong's own gloss: "shutting in." Same root → H2765 Chorem (devoted, place name), H2767 Chormah (devoted, place name — from Num 21:3 cherem execution), H2768 Chermon/Hermon (abrupt), H2770 chermesh (sickle, as cutting). NT equivalent: G331 anathema = "a (religious) ban or excommunicated thing/person."

**STATS:** H2764 noun ~29× OT (ban sense) + ~10× (net sense). H2763 verb ~52× OT. G331 anathema 6× NT. KJV translates as: accursed (10×), devoted/dedicated (6×), cursed thing (4×), utter destruction (2×), curse (3×), net (10×).

**DUAL SENSE — ONE ROOT:** "Net" and "ban" are NOT two homonyms awkwardly sharing a form. Both derive from "shutting in." A net physically encloses fish; a ban judicially encloses persons/goods in God's grip. The mechanism is identical: once enclosed, nothing escapes.

### Law Foundation

Lev 27:28-29 — DEFINING TEXT. Cherem = irrevocable devotion to YHWH. Cannot be sold or redeemed. "Most holy" (qodesh qodashim). Persons under cherem → death mandatory. co: HOLY. This is NOT primarily destruction — it's TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP. Destruction is the consequence for persons because God alone disposes of what He claims.

Lev 27:21 — Field going out in jubilee = cherem → becomes priest's possession. Positive sense: God receives it; priesthood administers.

Num 18:14 / Ezek 44:29 — Every cherem in Israel → belongs to priests. Confirms cherem as God's property, administered by priesthood. Parallel: firstfruits, tithes, sin-offerings.

Exod 22:20 — First cherem law: sacrifice to other gods → charam. Idolatry is the trigger. co: IDOLATRY.

Deut 7:2 — Seven Canaanite nations: charam utterly; no covenant, no mercy. co: NATIONS. Deut 7:26 — Contagion principle: bringing cherem-abomination into your house makes YOU cherem like it. co: IDOLATRY.

Deut 13:15-17 — Idolatrous Israelite city: charam with sword + burn city + gather spoil → heap forever. Nothing of cherem cleaves to hand. co: SWORD, FIRE. Key: applies to ISRAEL, not just Canaanites. Cherem operates wherever idolatry operates.

Deut 20:17 — Six nations listed for charam: Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites. co: NATIONS.

### Jericho Protocol (Josh 6-7)

Josh 6:17-18 — City shall be cherem to YHWH. Silver, gold, brass, iron → consecrated to YHWH treasury. Everything else → destruction. KEEP YOURSELVES from cherem lest you BECOME cherem and make camp cherem. Triple-threat: (1) take → (2) you become → (3) whole camp becomes. co: SWORD, FIRE.

Josh 6:21 — Charam execution: man, woman, young, old, ox, sheep, ass → sword. Total. co: SWORD.

Josh 7:1 — Achan takes from cherem. CONTAGION: God's anger kindles against ALL Israel. One man's breach → corporate liability. co: COVENANT.

Josh 7:11-13 — Israel sinned, transgressed covenant, taken cherem, stolen, dissembled, put among own stuff. Cannot stand before enemies BECAUSE they are cherem. Must destroy cherem from among them. Key: cherem is both the THING and the STATUS. Israel became what they touched.

Josh 7:15 — Taken with cherem → burnt with fire + all he has. Covenant transgression + folly in Israel. co: FIRE.

Josh 22:20 — Retrospective: Achan's cherem trespass → wrath on ALL congregation; he did NOT perish alone.

1Chr 2:7 — Achar (="troubler"), troubler of Israel, who transgressed in the cherem.

### Saul's Failure (1Sam 15)

1Sam 15:3 — YHWH commands: charam ALL Amalek — man, woman, infant, suckling, ox, sheep, camel, ass. Total. co: SWORD.

1Sam 15:8-9 — Saul charam the people by sword but SPARED Agag + best animals. Selective cherem = disobedience. "Would not charam them" — treated God's claim as optional.

1Sam 15:15,21 — Rationalization: kept the best "to sacrifice unto YHWH." Using cherem for worship = substituting human judgment for God's explicit claim. Samuel's verdict (v22-23): obedience > sacrifice; rebellion = witchcraft; stubbornness = idolatry.

1Sam 15:23,26 — Consequence: Saul rejected from being king. Partial cherem = rejection from authority. co: IDOLATRY.

1Sam 15:33 — Samuel himself executes Agag: "As thy sword made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless." co: SWORD. The prophet finishes what the king wouldn't.

### Key: 1Kgs 20:42 — Ahab releases Ben-hadad, "a man whom I appointed to cherem." "Therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people." SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE: whoever releases God's cherem takes the cherem upon themselves. Parallel: Saul spares Agag → loses kingship.

### Prophetic Oracle

Isa 34:2 — YHWH's indignation upon ALL nations; he hath charam them, delivered to slaughter. co: NATIONS, SWORD.

Isa 34:5 — "My sword bathed in heaven: descends on Idumea, upon the people of my cherem, to judgment." Sword = cherem execution instrument. co: SWORD, FIRE, HEAVEN. Isa 34:4 preceding: heavens rolled as scroll. SCROLL→SWORD→CHEREM chain.

Isa 43:28 — "I have given Jacob to the cherem, and Israel to reproaches." Israel ITSELF under God's ban. Exile = cherem against God's own people. The ban is not ethnic but covenantal.

Jer 25:9 — Nebuchadnezzar God's "servant" will charam nations + make desolations. God uses Babylon to execute cherem. co: BABYLON, DESOLATION.

Jer 50:21 — "Utterly destroy [charam] after them" — NOW Babylon itself under cherem. The cherem-executor becomes cherem-target. co: BABYLON, FALL_OF_BABYLON.

Dan 11:44 — King of north goes forth "to destroy and charam many." The last tyrant executes cherem-like fury but is himself destroyed (v45). co: NATIONS.

Isa 11:15 — YHWH shall charam the tongue of the Egyptian sea. Eschatological cherem on barriers to restoration.

### Net Passages (H2764 = net)

Hab 1:15-17 — Chaldeans (=BABYLON) catch nations in cherem (net), sacrifice to their cherem, burn incense to it. STUNNING: Babylon's NET is called by the same word as God's BAN. The empire worships its own power to enclose nations. "Shall they empty their cherem and not spare to slay nations?" co: BABYLON, NATIONS.

Ezek 32:3 — "I will spread my cherem over thee" — God catches Pharaoh in His net. God is the fisherman; Egypt the fish. co: NATIONS.

Ezek 26:5,14 — Tyre becomes "a place to spread cherem (nets)." Once-great city reduced to fishermen's platform. co: TYRE.

Mic 7:2 — "They hunt every man his brother with a cherem." Men using the ban-net on each other. Social collapse: the covenant community becomes a trap. co: WICKEDNESS.

Eccl 7:26 — Woman whose heart is "snares and cherem (nets)." The harlot figure captures sinners. co: HARLOT. Note: Babylon the harlot IS a cherem-system that encloses nations (Rev 17-18).

Ezek 47:10 — Fishers spread cherem (nets) at restored river. POSITIVE reversal: in restoration, nets = abundance, not destruction. co: WATER, RESTORATION.

### Bookend Passages

Mal 4:6 — "Lest I come and smite the earth with a cherem." LAST WORD of OT (in Christian canon order). The entire OT ends on the threat of total enclosure. Elijah's mission (v5): turn hearts → prevent cherem. co: FIRE (v1), HOREB/chereb (v4). Note: Mal 4:4 says "remember the law of Moses which I commanded in Horeb" — H2722 Choreb from same root as H2719 chereb (sword). Horeb + cherem in same paragraph = desolation-mountain + total-ban.

Zech 14:11 — "No more cherem; Jerusalem safely inhabited." The END of cherem. After YHWH becomes king over all earth (v9), the ban lifts. Everything previously enclosed in God's destructive claim is resolved. co: JERUSALEM, RETURN_OF_CHRIST.

### NT Equivalent

G331 anathema (from G394 anatithemi = to set up/devote) — direct Greek translation of H2764.

1Cor 16:22 — "If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha." Ban + "our Lord comes." The cherem-verdict awaits execution at the coming. co: RETURN_OF_CHRIST.

Rom 9:3 — Paul wishes himself anathema from Christ for his brethren. The cherem can be taken vicariously. co: SUBSTITUTION.

Gal 1:8-9 — Preaching another gospel → anathema (2×). False gospel = covenant violation → cherem status.

1Cor 12:3 — No one speaking by Spirit calls Jesus anathema. The cherem-verdict against Christ (cross) was reversed by resurrection.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

**1. Physical destruction / annihilation** — Lev 27:28 "every [annihilation] is most holy to YHWH" → FAILS. Cannot call annihilation "most holy."

**2. A spoken curse / imprecation** — Lev 27:28 "every [curse] is most holy" → FAILS. Too generic. Hab 1:15 "catch in their [curse]" → meaningless.

**3. Irrevocable devotion to God** — Lev 27:28 WORKS. Josh 6:17 WORKS. Deut 7:26 awkward ("lest thou be [devoted to God] like it"). Hab 1:15 FAILS (net sense).

**4. Physical net / enclosure** — Hab 1:15 WORKS. Lev 27:28 FAILS ("every [net] is most holy"). Ban-sense inaccessible.

**5. Irrevocable covenant forfeiture to divine jurisdiction** — Lev 27:28 WORKS (forfeited = most holy). Josh 6:17-18 WORKS. Deut 7:26 WORKS (abomination already forfeited; your contact forfeits you). Isa 34:5 WORKS. Mal 4:6 WORKS. Zech 14:11 WORKS. 1Kgs 20:42 WORKS. Hab 1:15 PARTIAL (net as "enclosure" but misses forfeiture aspect).

**6. Contagious holiness / radioactive zone** — Josh 6:18 PERFECT. Josh 7:12 PERFECT. Deut 7:26 PERFECT. Lev 27:28 awkward. Captures the mechanism but not the noun itself.

**7. ✅ God's total enclosure — irrevocable seizure from which nothing escapes or can be redeemed** — UNIFIES BOTH SENSES. Net physically encloses; ban judicially encloses. Both = shutting in with no exit. Lev 27:28 "every [total enclosure by God] is most holy" WORKS. Josh 6:17 "city shall be [enclosed by God's claim]" WORKS. Hab 1:15 "catch in their [enclosure]" WORKS. Mic 7:2 "hunt brother with [enclosure]" WORKS. Deut 7:26 "lest thou be [enclosed] like it" WORKS. Isa 34:5 "people of my [enclosure]" WORKS. Mal 4:6 "smite earth with [total enclosure]" WORKS. Zech 14:11 "no more [enclosure]" WORKS. Eccl 7:26 "her heart is [enclosures]" WORKS.

**8. Covenant termination protocol** — Too narrow. Cherem applies to Canaanites who had no covenant. And Lev 27:21 positive devotion doesn't terminate anything.

**9. Point of no return** — Captures irreversibility but not the mechanism. Subset of #7.

## Adopted Meaning

**CHEREM = God's total enclosure — that which is shut in by divine claim, from which nothing can be redeemed or escape.** Root = seclusion/shutting-in. The net (physical) and ban (judicial) share one mechanism: ENCLOSURE WITHOUT EXIT. For persons: death. For property: most holy, transferred to priesthood. For cities: total destruction + burning. CONTAGION: contact with the enclosed makes you enclosed (Josh 6:18, 7:12, Deut 7:26). SUBSTITUTION: releasing what God enclosed transfers the enclosure to you (1Kgs 20:42, 1Sam 15).

## Patterns

1. **NET=BAN:** Same word, same root, same mechanism. Babylon's cherem-net catches nations (Hab 1:15) while God's cherem-ban catches Babylon (Jer 50:21). The hunter becomes the hunted. Ezek 32:3: God Himself is the fisherman.

2. **CONTAGION:** Unique property — touching cherem makes you cherem. Josh 6:18 → 7:1-13: one man's breach → corporate liability. Deut 7:26: bringing cherem into house makes house cherem. No other Hebrew concept has this transfer property.

3. **SUBSTITUTION:** Whoever releases God's cherem absorbs it. 1Kgs 20:42: Ahab releases Ben-hadad → "thy life for his life." 1Sam 15:23: Saul spares Agag → loses kingship. Pattern: human mercy toward what God has claimed = human absorption of the claim.

4. **IRREVERSIBILITY:** Lev 27:28-29: cannot be sold, cannot be redeemed. Once cherem, always cherem. This is the opposite of every other offering (burnt, peace, guilt) which CAN be redeemed or substituted.

5. **CHEREM→EXECUTOR→CHEREM:** The instrument God uses to execute cherem eventually comes under cherem itself. Babylon executes cherem on nations (Jer 25:9) → Babylon itself under cherem (Jer 50:21). Assyria claims to charam nations (2Kgs 19:11) → Assyria falls. The sword that delivers God's ban is itself consumed.

6. **OT BOOKENDS:** Mal 4:6 = cherem threatened. Zech 14:11 = cherem ended. Between these two prophetic endpoints: the entire Day-of-the-LORD sequence. The SWORD study notes Mal 4:4 Horeb (H2722, root=chereb) + Mal 4:6 cherem (H2764) in same paragraph = desolation-mountain + total-ban. The FLYING-SCROLL study notes Isa 34:4-5 scroll→sword→cherem chain.

7. **CHEREM CHAIN:** Mal 4:6 (threat on earth) → Isa 34:2,5 (sword from heaven on cherem-people) → Jer 50:21 (cherem executed on Babylon) → Zech 14:11 (cherem lifted in restored Jerusalem). NOTE: Zech 5:3 flying scroll carries H423 alah (oath-curse), not H2764 cherem — different word, parallel operation. The scroll delivers the alah; the sword executes the cherem.

8. **POSITIVE RESOLUTION:** Ezek 47:10 nets (cherem) at restored river = abundance. Zech 14:11 no more cherem. The enclosure is not permanent — it has a terminus. After the ban lifts, the same instrument (net) serves life instead of death.

9. **NT ANATHEMA:** G331 exact equivalent. 1Cor 16:22 "Anathema Maranatha" = banned-until-the-Lord-comes. The cherem-status awaits execution at the parousia. Gal 1:8-9: false gospel = cherem trigger (cf. Exod 22:20 idolatry = cherem trigger). Paul's willingness to be anathema for Israel (Rom 9:3) = vicarious cherem, echoing Christ who BECAME the cherem on the cross — the one "devoted to destruction" who could not be redeemed (Lev 27:29) yet whom God raised, breaking the enclosure from within.
