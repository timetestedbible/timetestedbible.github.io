words: ["devoted", "accursed", "cursed thing", "utter destruction", "utterly destroy", "utterly destroyed", "ban", "net", "dedicated thing", "forfeited"]
role: noun-symbol
meaning: God's total enclosure — irrevocable seizure by divine claim from which nothing can be redeemed or escape. As a net shuts in fish, the cherem-ban shuts persons/cities/goods into God's exclusive jurisdiction for disposal. Contagious — touching what God has claimed makes you claimed.
opposite: REDEMPTION (H1350 gaal / H6299 padah — cherem is defined as that which CANNOT be redeemed, Lev 27:28-29)

## Context Bag

**ROOTS:** H2763 charam (verb: seclude, devote by ban). H2764 cherem (noun: net / doomed object / extermination). Root = ENCLOSURE/SHUTTING-IN. "Net" and "ban" are NOT homonyms — both derive from shutting-in. Net physically encloses fish; ban judicially encloses persons in God's grip. Same mechanism. → H2767 Chormah (place of cherem, Num 21:3). NT: G331 anathema = ban/excommunicated. H2764 noun ~29× (ban) + ~10× (net). H2763 verb ~52×.

**LAW FOUNDATION:**
Lev 27:28-29 — DEFINING. Cherem = irrevocable devotion to YHWH. Cannot sell/redeem. "Most holy." Persons → death. NOT primarily destruction — TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP.
Num 18:14/Ezek 44:29 — Every cherem → priests. God's property administered by priesthood.
Exod 22:20 — Sacrifice to other gods → charam. Idolatry = trigger.
Deut 7:26 — CONTAGION: bringing cherem into house makes YOU cherem like it.
Deut 13:15-17 — Idolatrous Israelite city: charam+sword+burn. Applies to ISRAEL, not just Canaanites.

**JERICHO PROTOCOL (Josh 6-7):**
Josh 6:17-18 — Triple-threat: take cherem → become cherem → make camp cherem. co: SWORD+FIRE.
Josh 7:1,11-13 — Achan: one man's breach → corporate liability. Israel BECAME what they touched. Cherem is both THING and STATUS.
Josh 22:20 — Retrospective: Achan's trespass → wrath on ALL congregation.

**SAUL'S FAILURE:** 1Sam 15:8-9 — Selective cherem = disobedience. v23: partial cherem = rejection from authority.
1Kgs 20:42 — SUBSTITUTION: Ahab releases cherem-appointed Ben-hadad → "thy life for his life." Releasing God's cherem = absorbing it.

**PROPHETIC:**
Isa 34:2,5 — Sword bathed in heaven descends on cherem-people. SCROLL→SWORD→CHEREM chain. co: SWORD+FIRE+HEAVEN.
Isa 43:28 — Israel itself under cherem. Ban is covenantal, not ethnic.
Jer 25:9 — Babylon = God's servant executing cherem. Jer 50:21 — Babylon itself under cherem. EXECUTOR→TARGET.
Hab 1:15-17 — Babylon's NET called cherem. Empire worships own power to enclose nations. co: BABYLON.
Ezek 26:5,14 — Tyre → place to spread cherem (nets). co: TYRE.
Eccl 7:26 — Harlot's heart = cherem (nets). → Babylon harlot = cherem-system.
Ezek 47:10 — POSITIVE: nets at restored river = abundance. Enclosure serves life in restoration.

**BOOKENDS:**
Mal 4:6 — LAST WORD of OT: "smite earth with cherem." Elijah's mission: turn hearts → prevent ban. co: FIRE. Mal 4:4 "Horeb" (H2722 from chereb/sword root) + cherem in same paragraph.
Zech 14:11 — "No more cherem." Ban lifts after YHWH becomes king (v9). co: JERUSALEM+RETURN_OF_CHRIST.

**NT ANATHEMA (G331):**
1Cor 16:22 — "Anathema Maranatha" = ban awaits execution at parousia. co: RETURN_OF_CHRIST.
Gal 1:8-9 — False gospel → anathema (2×). = Exod 22:20 idolatry trigger.
Rom 9:3 — Paul wishes self anathema = vicarious cherem. Echoes Christ who BECAME cherem on cross — devoted to destruction yet raised, breaking enclosure from within.
1Cor 12:3 — No one by Spirit calls Jesus anathema. Resurrection reversed cherem-status.

**PATTERNS:**
1. **NET=BAN:** Same word, same mechanism. Babylon's cherem-net catches nations (Hab 1:15); God's cherem-ban catches Babylon (Jer 50:21). Hunter→hunted.
2. **CONTAGION:** Touching cherem = becoming cherem. Josh 6:18→7:1-13. Unique transfer property.
3. **SUBSTITUTION:** Releasing God's cherem → absorb it. 1Kgs 20:42, 1Sam 15.
4. **IRREVERSIBILITY:** Lev 27:28-29. Cannot sell/redeem. Opposite of every other offering.
5. **EXECUTOR→CHEREM:** Babylon executes cherem (Jer 25:9) → becomes cherem (Jer 50:21). Sword that delivers ban is itself consumed.
6. **BOOKENDS:** Mal 4:6 cherem threatened → Zech 14:11 cherem ended. Between = entire Day-of-LORD.
7. **POSITIVE RESOLUTION:** Ezek 47:10 nets serve life. Zech 14:11 ban lifts. Enclosure has a terminus.
