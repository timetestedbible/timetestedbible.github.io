## Lexical Field

**[H697] arbeh** = locust (from H7235 rabah "to multiply") — primary OT word. ~24×. Named for RAPID INCREASE.
**[H1501] gazam** = palmerworm (from unused root "to devour"). 3×. Named for DEVOURING.
**[H3218] yeleq** = cankerworm/young locust (from unused root "to lick up"). 9×. Named for LICKING CLEAN.
**[H2625] chasil** = caterpiller/ravager (from H2628 chasal "to eat off"). 6×. Named for STRIPPING.
**[H5556] sol'am** = bald locust (from H5553 sela "rock" → crushing/consuming). 1×. Named for CRUSHING.
**[H2284] chagab** = grasshopper/locust. 5×. Uncertain derivation.
**[H1462] gowb** = locust larva (from H1461 "to grub"). 2×. Named for GRUBBING.
**[H1357] geb** = locust (from H1461 → "cutting"). 1×. Named for CUTTING.
**[H6767] ts'latsal** = whirring insect/cymbal (from H6750 "to clatter"). 1× as locust. Named for SOUND of wings.

Every Hebrew root for locust-type words encodes a BEHAVIOR: multiply, devour, lick, strip, crush, grub, cut, clatter, leap. The lexical field itself defines the symbol: these are AGENTS OF CONSUMPTION in escalating stages.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **Invading army** — fits Joel 2, Judg 6-7, Jer 46, but fails Lev 11:22 (clean food), Matt 3:4 (John ate them), Eccl 12:5, Ps 109:23. Too narrow.
2. **Literal insects** — fails Rev 9:3-10 (composite creatures that DON'T eat grass). Can't be purely literal.
3. **Devouring multitude** — captures consumption but not God's commission. Doesn't resolve food meaning (Lev 11, Matt 3:4).
4. **Foreign nations** — fits Judg 6-7, Nah 3, Jer 46, but Joel 2:25 = "MY army" (God's, not foreign). Rev 9 = supernatural. Lev 11 = eating nations? Fails.
5. **Parasites who consume without producing** — fits Nah 3:16 (merchants) but God claims them as HIS army (Joel 2:25). Not parasitic from God's perspective.
6. **Covenant curse agents** — fits Deut 28, Joel, Solomon's prayer, but Exod 10 (Egypt not under Mosaic covenant), Rev 9 (not covenant context). Too narrow.
7. ✓ **God-commissioned agents of consumption that strip what has been produced** — passes ALL contexts. See substitution test below.
8. **Demonic spirits from abyss** — fits Rev 9 only. Fails all OT + literal contexts.
9. **Self-organizing collective force** — captures Prov 30:27 ("no king") but fails Rev 9:11 (DO have a king). Partial.
10. **Testing/purifying instruments** — fits as sub-function (stripping reveals what's real) but too abstract for narrative contexts.

- Amos 4:9 — [consuming agents] devoured gardens/vineyards ✓ (judgment for not returning to God)
- Nah 3:16-17 — merchants = [consuming agents] who spoil + flee; crowned/captains = [consuming agents] ✓
- Matt 3:4 — John ate [consuming agents] ✓ (wilderness prophet internalized/lived on God's stripping judgment — his message WAS judgment: "repent, axe at root of trees")
- Rev 9:3-10 — [consuming agents] from smoke of abyss, given scorpion power ✓
- Rev 9:4 — NOT to hurt GRASS/TREES but only unsealed men ✓ (INVERTED: natural consumers of vegetation redirected to consume the wellbeing of the wicked specifically)
- Rev 9:11 — king = Abaddon/Apollyon "Destroyer" ✓ (ruler of consuming agents from containment)

## Context Bag

Joel 1:4 — subj: four-stage army. gazam(devourer)→arbeh(multiplier)→yeleq(licker)→chasil(stripper). Joel 2:25 reverses + declares "MY great ARMY which I SENT." Joel 1:6 — "NATION" with "teeth of LION" → composite. co: TREE (1:12 all trees withered), FIRE (1:19-20). Joel 2:1-11 — locust = Day of LORD: HORSES (v.4=Rev 9:7), CHARIOTS (v.5=Rev 9:9), fire before/behind, sun/moon DARK (v.10=Rev 9:2), earth QUAKES. GOD utters voice before HIS army (v.11).
Rev 9:1-11 — subj: composite locusts from abyss. PIT opened → SMOKE → SUN+AIR DARKENED → locusts emerge. co: SMOKE+PIT-ABYSS+DARKNESS+SEAL. CRITICAL INVERSION (v.4): NOT hurt GRASS/TREES → only men WITHOUT seal. Real locusts eat vegetation; these DON'T. v.5 — torment 5 months, cannot kill. Composite anatomy: HORSES (=Joel 2:4) + CROWNS (authority) + faces of MEN + hair of WOMEN + teeth of LIONS (=Joel 1:6) + iron BREASTPLATES + WINGS as chariots (=Joel 2:5) + SCORPION tails. v.11 — KING: Abaddon/Apollyon = "Destroyer." NOTE: Prov 30:27 natural locusts NO king → abyss version HAS king = organized destruction.
Exod 10:4-19 — subj: 8th plague. EAST WIND brings; WEST WIND removes into Red Sea. co: WIND. Ate every herb + fruit HAIL left. Sequential: hail→locusts consumed remainder.
Nah 3:15-17 — subj: EXPLICIT EQUATION. merchants = cankerworm, crowned/captains = locusts/grasshoppers. Properties: multiply, camp temporarily, flee when exposed (sun rises). Transient consumers who abandon when conditions change.
Lev 11:22 — subj: four locust-types = CLEAN food. God's consuming agents can be internalized. Matt 3:4 / Mk 1:6 — John ate locusts+honey. Wilderness prophet fed on judgment instruments; his message = judgment ("axe at root of TREES").
Joel 2:25 / 2Chr 7:13 / Ps 105:34 / Amos 4:9 / Amos 7:1 — GOD COMMISSIONS THEM in every prophetic context. "MY army," "I COMMAND," "He SPAKE." Deut 28:38,42 — covenant curse sequence.
Num 13:33 / Isa 40:22 / Eccl 12:5 / Ps 109:23 — subj: smallness before God. Humanity = locust-scale. Transient, wind-displaced.
Jer 51:14,27 — subj: army against Babylon = consuming swarm. co: FALL_OF_BABYLON. Isa 33:4 — spoil gathered like locust.
Judg 6:5, 7:12 — subj: Midianites = grasshoppers for multitude. Foreign oppressors as God's consuming agents against unfaithful Israel (6:1 "did evil → delivered to Midian").

**PATTERNS**: (1) MULTIPLY — H697 from H7235; (2) CONSUME — devour/strip what others produced; (3) COMMISSIONED — God sends, commands, owns; (4) COLLECTIVE — swarm, no individual focus; (5) TRANSIENT — arrive, consume, depart (Nah 3:17). Rev 9 INVERTS natural target: consume wellbeing of unsealed, not vegetation. SYMBOL CHAIN: PIT→SMOKE→DARKNESS→LOCUSTS→torment unsealed. Cross-ref: pit-abyss.md, smoke.md, grass.md (Rev 9:4 grass protected), seal.md.
