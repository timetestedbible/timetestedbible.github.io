## Lexical Field

**[H697] arbeh** = locust (from H7235 rabah "to multiply") — primary OT word. ~24×. Named for RAPID INCREASE.
**[H1501] gazam** = palmerworm (from unused root "to devour"). 3×. Named for DEVOURING.
**[H3218] yeleq** = cankerworm/young locust (from unused root "to lick up"). 9×. Named for LICKING CLEAN.
**[H2625] chasil** = caterpiller/ravager (from H2628 chasal "to eat off"). 6×. Named for STRIPPING.
**[H5556] sol'am** = bald locust (from H5553 sela "rock" → crushing/consuming). 1×. Named for CRUSHING.
**[H2284] chagab** = grasshopper/locust. 5×. Uncertain derivation.
**[H1462] gowb** = locust larva (from H1461 "to grub"). 2×. Named for GRUBBING.
**[H1357] geb** = locust (from H1461 → "cutting"). 1×. Named for CUTTING.
**[H6767] ts'latsal** = whirring insect/cymbal (from H6750 "to clatter"). 1× as locust. Named for SOUND of wings.
**[H2728] chargol** = leaping insect (from H2727). 1×. KJV "beetle." Named for LEAPING.

Every Hebrew root for locust-type words encodes a BEHAVIOR: multiply, devour, lick, strip, crush, grub, cut, clatter, leap. The lexical field itself defines the symbol: these are AGENTS OF CONSUMPTION in escalating stages.

## Candidate Meanings Tested

1. **Invading army** — fits Joel 2, Judg 6-7, Jer 46, but fails Lev 11:22 (clean food), Matt 3:4 (John ate them), Eccl 12:5, Ps 109:23. Too narrow.
2. **Literal insects** — fails Rev 9:3-10 (composite creatures that DON'T eat grass). Can't be purely literal.
3. **Devouring multitude** — captures consumption but not God's commission. Doesn't resolve food meaning (Lev 11, Matt 3:4).
4. **Foreign nations** — fits Judg 6-7, Nah 3, Jer 46, but Joel 2:25 = "MY army" (God's, not foreign). Rev 9 = supernatural. Lev 11 = eating nations? Fails.
5. **Parasites who consume without producing** — fits Nah 3:16 (merchants) but God claims them as HIS army (Joel 2:25). Not parasitic from God's perspective.
6. **Covenant curse agents** — fits Deut 28, Joel, Solomon's prayer, but Exod 10 (Egypt not under Mosaic covenant), Rev 9 (not covenant context). Too narrow.
7. ✓ **God-commissioned agents of consumption that strip what has been produced** — passes ALL contexts. See substitution test below.
8. **Demonic spirits from abyss** — fits Rev 9 only. Fails all OT + literal contexts.
9. **Self-organizing collective force** — captures Prov 30:27 ("no king") but fails Rev 9:11 (DO have a king). Partial.
10. **Testing/purifying instruments** — fits as sub-function (stripping reveals what's real) but too abstract for narrative contexts.

## Context Bag

**JOEL'S FOUR-STAGE ARMY**: Joel 1:4 — gazam(devourer)→arbeh(multiplier)→yeleq(licker)→chasil(stripper). Four escalating stages of stripping. Joel 2:25 reverses order + declares: "MY great ARMY which I SENT." God commissions the locust. Joel 1:6 — called a "NATION" with "teeth of a LION" → composite: nation+lion+locust. Joel 1:12 — result: vine dried, fig tree languished, ALL TREES of field withered, joy withered. CO: TREE, FIRE (1:19-20). Joel 2:1-11 — locust army = Day of LORD: appearance as HORSES (v.4=Rev 9:7), noise of CHARIOTS (v.5=Rev 9:9), fire before/behind (v.3), sun/moon DARK (v.10=Rev 9:2), earth QUAKES (v.10). GOD utters voice before HIS army (v.11).

**REVELATION 9 COMPOSITE LOCUSTS**: Rev 9:1-2 — star falls, opens PIT → SMOKE like furnace → SUN+AIR DARKENED. v.3 — locusts emerge FROM smoke. CO: SMOKE+PIT-ABYSS+DARKNESS+SEAL. v.4 — CRITICAL INVERSION: commanded NOT to hurt GRASS, green things, TREES → only men WITHOUT seal of God. Real locusts eat vegetation; these DON'T. Symbol targets the UNSEALED specifically. v.5 — cannot kill, only torment 5 months. v.7-10 — composite anatomy: HORSES for battle (=Joel 2:4) + CROWNS like gold (authority) + faces of MEN (intelligence) + hair of WOMEN (covering/display) + teeth of LIONS (=Joel 1:6) + BREASTPLATES of iron (military protection) + WINGS sounding as chariots/horses to battle (=Joel 2:5) + TAILS like SCORPIONS with stings (trailing harm). v.11 — KING: angel of ABYSS, Abaddon/Apollyon = "Destroyer." Note: Prov 30:27 natural locusts have NO king → Rev 9 supernatural locusts DO have a king. The abyss version is organized under a ruler of destruction.

**EGYPT PLAGUE**: Exod 10:4-19 — 8th plague. EAST WIND (H7307+H6921) brings them; strong WEST WIND removes them into Red Sea. CO: WIND. "Before them there were no such locusts, neither after." Ate every herb + fruit of trees that HAIL left. Sequential judgment: hail stripped partially → locusts consumed remainder. Pattern: God uses natural forces as commissioned agents. Not one remained (v.19).

**NAHUM'S DECODING**: Nah 3:15-17 — Nineveh addressed. v.15: "make thyself many as cankerworm(H3218), many as locusts(H697)." v.16: "multiplied thy MERCHANTS above stars of heaven: the cankerworm SPOILETH and FLIETH AWAY." v.17: "thy CROWNED are as LOCUSTS, thy CAPTAINS as great GRASSHOPPERS(H1462), which CAMP in hedges in cold day; sun ariseth → FLEE AWAY, place NOT KNOWN." EXPLICIT EQUATION: merchants=cankerworm, crowned/captains=locusts/grasshoppers. Properties: multiply, camp temporarily, flee when exposed (sun rises). Transient consumers who abandon when conditions change.

**CLEAN FOOD**: Lev 11:22 — four types listed as CLEAN: arbeh, sol'am, chargol, chagab. Only leaping insects with jointed legs above feet are clean. ALL other swarming creatures unclean. Significance: God's consuming agents can be internalized. John Baptist (Matt 3:4, Mark 1:6) literally ate locusts + wild HONEY — the wilderness prophet fed on God's judgment instruments. His message = judgment ("axe laid to root of TREES," Matt 3:10 — consuming agent against nations).

**GOD COMMISSIONS THEM**: Joel 2:25 — "MY great army which I SENT." 2Chr 7:13 — "if I COMMAND the locusts." Ps 105:34 — "He SPAKE and locusts came." Deut 28:38,42 — covenant curse sequence. Amos 4:9 — "the palmerworm devoured… yet ye not returned unto ME." Amos 7:1 — God FORMED grasshoppers. In every prophetic context, God claims ownership/commission of the locust force.

**NO KING / HAS KING CONTRAST**: Prov 30:27 — "locusts have NO KING, yet go forth by bands." Natural/earthly consuming agents self-organize without central authority. Rev 9:11 — abyss locusts HAVE a king: Abaddon/Apollyon. Abyss version = organized destruction under a ruler. The pit containment (see pit-abyss.md) had a king over its consuming forces — when opened, organized destruction emerges vs. the natural self-organizing pattern.

**SMALLNESS BEFORE GOD**: Num 13:33 — "we were as grasshoppers(H2284) in our own sight." Isa 40:22 — "inhabitants are as grasshoppers." Eccl 12:5 — "grasshopper shall be a burden" (old age: even small things overwhelm). From God's vantage, humanity = locust-scale. Ps 109:23 — "tossed up and down as locust" = driven, transient, wind-displaced.

**AGAINST BABYLON**: Jer 51:14 — "fill thee with men AS WITH caterpillers(H3218); they shall lift up a SHOUT." Jer 51:27 — "cause horses to come up as rough caterpillers(H3218)" — army against Babylon = consuming swarm. CO: FALL_OF_BABYLON. Isa 33:4 — spoil gathered like caterpiller(H2625) gathering; locusts(H1357) running to and fro. God sends consuming agents against oppressor nations too.

**MIDIANITE PATTERN**: Judg 6:5 — Midianites "came as grasshoppers(H697) for multitude… entered into the land TO DESTROY it." Judg 7:12 — "lay along in valley like grasshoppers for multitude; camels without number, as SAND by sea." Foreign oppressors functioning as God's consuming agents against unfaithful Israel (Judg 6:1 — "Israel did evil → LORD delivered them to Midian").

**PATTERN SUMMARY**: Five consistent properties across all contexts: (1) MULTIPLY — rapid increase, overwhelming numbers (H697 from H7235); (2) CONSUME — devour, strip, lick up what others produced; (3) COMMISSIONED — God sends, commands, claims them as His army; (4) COLLECTIVE — swarm behavior, bands, no individual focus; (5) TRANSIENT — arrive, consume, depart (Nah 3:17 "flee away, place not known"). Dual register: natural (physical crop destruction) and symbolic (nations/forces stripping productivity/wellbeing). Rev 9 INVERTS the natural target: these consume wellbeing of the unsealed rather than vegetation. The smoke→locust chain (Rev 9:2-3) connects to smoke.md's darkening mechanism: FIRE→SMOKE→DARKNESS→CONSUMING AGENTS EMERGE. The pit→smoke→locust sequence = containment opened → evidence of burning rises → consuming agents released upon the earth.

**SYMBOL CHAIN**: PIT opened → SMOKE rises → SUN/AIR DARKENED → LOCUSTS emerge from SMOKE → torment those without SEAL. This is the Rev 9 sequence. Cross-reference: pit-abyss.md (containment opened), smoke.md (darkening mechanism), grass.md (Rev 9:4 — grass NOT hurt = God's people protected), seal.md (unsealed = vulnerable).
