## Context Bag

**DEFINITIONAL:** Dual application — God IS light (1 John 1:5) + Christ IS light (John 8:12) + believers ARE light (Matt 5:14, Eph 5:8, Phil 2:15). Meaning must work for all three → visible example of commandment-keeping.

**FUNCTIONAL:** Light shines/radiates outward (John 1:5, Matt 5:16, 2 Cor 4:6) + reveals/makes manifest (John 3:21, Eph 5:13) + enables others to SEE (Matt 5:16) + enables others to WALK (John 11:9-10, 12:35) + guides/leads (Ps 43:3, Luke 1:79, Ps 119:105) + reproves/exposes (John 3:20, Eph 5:13). Key: light doesn't just exist — it shines so others see and walk.

**BEHAVIORAL:** Walk in it (John 12:35, Eph 5:8, 1 John 1:7) + be children of it (John 12:36, 1 Thess 5:5) + let it shine (Matt 5:16) + put on armor of it (Rom 13:12).

**ANTITHETICAL:** DARKNESS = hidden evil/confusion || LIGHT = visible righteousness/clarity. Evil deeds → hide in DARKNESS (John 3:19-20); good deeds → come to LIGHT openly (John 3:21). Darkness + Satan's power (Acts 26:18). Darkness + hatred (1 John 2:9). Walking in darkness → not knowing where going (John 12:35).

**SUBSTITUTION TEST:** "God is [visible example]" ✓ (1 John 1:5) | "Ye are the [visible example] of the world" ✓ (Matt 5:14) | "Let your [example] shine before men that they may see your good works" ✓✓ (Matt 5:16) | "I am the [visible example] of the world" ✓ (John 8:12).

**WHY NOT ALTERNATIVES:** "Truth" misses outward-shining aspect; "Righteousness" misses demonstrative/modeling function; "Revelation" too informational, not lifestyle. "Visible example" unifies all functions: seen + enables walking + reproves by contrast + guides.

**CLOSING THE LOOP — Example of WHAT?** Matt 5:16 → "good works" → righteousness → commandments. Chain: Righteousness = commandments (Deut 6:25, Ps 119:172) + way of righteousness = holy commandment (2 Pet 2:21). Matt 5:17-18 immediately follows 5:14-16: LIGHT (visible example) defined by law/Torah. LIGHT → visible example of commandment-keeping.

**THREE-TIER APPLICATION:** God = perfect visible example of His own standard | Christ = embodiment of that example (Torah made flesh) | Believers = called to BE that visible example (living Torah before others). LIGHT on a MOUNTAIN → visible example in a kingdom (Matt 5:14). FRUIT of light = WORKS of obedience (Eph 5:9). Walking in LIGHT = walking in THE WAY.
