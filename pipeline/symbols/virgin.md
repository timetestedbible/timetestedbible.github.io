## Context Bag

**Core frame:** MARRIAGE metaphor governs entire symbol. God = Husband, Israel/Church = Wife, Covenant = MARRIAGE. VIRGIN = faithful wife (has not committed adultery). HARLOT = unfaithful wife (has committed adultery). They are strict opposites.

**Defining chain:** VIRGIN (faithful) → commits FORNICATION (idolatry) → becomes HARLOT (idolater). Reverse: HARLOT → repents → becomes VIRGIN again (restored FAITH).

**Key arguments:**

1. **Rev 14:4** — "not defiled with women; they are VIRGINS… FOLLOW THE LAMB." "Women" = symbolic → BABYLON/false religious systems. VIRGIN = not defiled (no spiritual FORNICATION) + follows Lamb (FAITH/obedience). Strongest defining verse.

2. **2 Cor 11:2** — Paul espouses church as "chaste VIRGIN to Christ" → exclusively devoted to one master. VIRGIN = FAITH maintained, no spiritual adultery with false teachings.

3. **Prophetic personification — "virgin daughter of Zion/Israel":** 2 Kings 19:21 || Isa 37:22 — "the VIRGIN the daughter of Zion." Jer 31:4 — "thou shalt be built, O VIRGIN of Israel." Jer 31:21 — "turn again, O VIRGIN of Israel" (restoration call). Lam 2:13 — "O VIRGIN daughter of Zion." Amos 5:2 — "The VIRGIN of Israel is fallen." Pattern: Israel as VIRGIN = Israel in covenant FAITH, or called to return to it. Subj: JERUSALEM as faithful community.

4. **Rev 17:1, 17:2, 17:5** — BABYLON = "great WHORE," "MOTHER OF HARLOTS." Kings committed FORNICATION with her → IDOLATRY. HARLOT = system leading nations (SEA) into idolatry. Direct opposite of VIRGIN.

5. **Isa 1:21** — "faithful city become an HARLOT" → explicit contrast: faithful = VIRGIN state, HARLOT = fallen state. Subj: JERUSALEM transitioned from VIRGIN → HARLOT.

6. **Hosea 1:2** — "wife of whoredoms… land committed great whoredom, departing from the LORD." Gomer = Israel as HARLOT, having departed from God. Restoration theme: HARLOT → VIRGIN again through return to FAITH.

7. **Rev contrast:** BABYLON the HARLOT (Rev 17) || the Bride/VIRGIN (Rev 19, Rev 21 → JERUSALEM). Two women = two systems: IDOLATRY vs. FAITH.

**Symbol linkages:** VIRGIN + FAITH (obedience) + TRUTH (God's standard to follow). HARLOT + FORNICATION (idolatry) + IDOLATRY (self-rule) + BABYLON (worldly kingdom). MARRIAGE frames both. JERUSALEM = Bride/covenant community when faithful = VIRGIN. When fallen (Isa 1:21) = HARLOT.

**Substitution confirmation:** "chaste virgin to Christ" → "faithfully devoted to Christ" ✓. "they are virgins" → "they are faithful" ✓. "O virgin of Israel" → "O faithful Israel" ✓. "great whore" → "great idolater" ✓. "MOTHER OF HARLOTS" → "MOTHER OF IDOLATERS" ✓. "faithful city become harlot" → "faithful city become idolater" ✓. "wife of whoredoms" → "wife who commits idolatry" ✓.
