## Context Bag

**H7722 (שׁוֹאָה/שׁוֹא)** — desolation, ruin, devastation. BDB: catastrophe, ruin. LXX renders: ὄλεθρος, ἀπώλεια, ταλαιπωρία. Compare H7723 (שָׁוְא vanity/emptiness).

**H6365 (פִּיד)** — ruin, disaster, calamity. BDB: misfortune. LXX: ὄλεθρος. See H6364 (Pi-beseth). Only 4x: Job 12:5, 30:24, Pro 24:22, Isa 47:11.

**G160 (αἰφνίδιος)** — sudden, unexpected. Only 2x NT: Lk 21:34, 1Th 5:3. Related G869 (ἄφνω).

**G3639 (ὄλεθρος)** — destruction, ruin. 4x NT: 1Th 5:3, 2Th 1:9, 1Co 5:5, 1Ti 6:9.

**KEY OCCURRENCES:**

1Th 5:3 — "peace and safety" then sudden destruction (G160+G3639); BIRTH_PAINS co-occur; NIGHT/DAY/SLEEP/DARKNESS framing (vv1-8); speaker=Paul; discourse; Rome cycle. Escape impossible (οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν). Directly follows RETURN_OF_CHRIST (4:13-18).

Lk 21:34-36 — G160; "that day come upon you suddenly as a snare"; SLEEP(surfeiting/drunkenness); all earth; speaker=Jesus; discourse/apocalyptic; preceded by fig tree parable, DAYS_OF_NOAH parallel in Mt24.

Isa 47:11 — H7722+H6365; BABYLON destruction "in a moment" (MOMENT); sorceries/enchantments; oracle against Babylon; speaker=YHWH; Exile cycle. FALL_OF_BABYLON co-occur.

Isa 13:6-9 — H7722; "destruction from the Almighty" (שֹׁד מִשַּׁדַּי wordplay); Day of LORD; BABYLON oracle header; cruel wrath; prophetic; Exile.

Pro 6:15 — H7722+H6365; "suddenly broken without remedy"; deceitful man sowing discord; wisdom; no covenant faithfulness.

Pro 29:1 — H7722 implied; "suddenly destroyed without remedy"; stiff-necked refusing reproof; wisdom.

Pro 1:26-27 — H7722; wisdom rejected, destruction as whirlwind; fear; wisdom personified speaks.

Job 22:10 — H7722; sudden fear/snares; Eliphaz discourse; patriarch cycle.

Jer 6:26 — H7722; "destroyer suddenly come"; mourning; JERUSALEM under judgment; prophetic; speaker=YHWH; Exile.

Ps 35:8 — H7722; destruction come upon enemy unawares; psalm; David.

**CLUSTER:** Overwhelmingly clusters around covenant-judgment contexts — Babylon's fall, Jerusalem's judgment for unfaithfulness, wisdom-refusers destroyed. Always targets those who HAD access to covenant knowledge but rejected.

**CONSISTENT READING:** Inescapable covenant-judgment falling instantaneously on those living in false security while violating covenant terms. The "suddenness" marks the gap between perceived safety and actual guilt.

**ANOMALIES:** Job 22:10 — Eliphaz misapplies principle to Job; proves the concept is well-known but wrongly applied by false counselors.

**CROSS-TESTAMENT:** H7722→LXX ὄλεθρος→G3639 in 1Th 5:3. Direct linguistic chain. H6365→LXX ὄλεθρος confirms. Paul's "sudden destruction" = Isaiah's Babylon oracle vocabulary.

**TRIPLE-LANGUAGE:** H7722 שׁוֹאָה cognate with H7723 שָׁוְא (vanity/emptiness) — destruction IS the substance of emptiness. Those pursuing שָׁוְא receive שׁוֹאָה.
