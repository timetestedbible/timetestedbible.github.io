## Context Bag

**Definitional:** Gen 1:5 — God called DARKNESS → NIGHT. Foundational equation: NIGHT = DARKNESS. Since DARKNESS → Hidden/Concealed Disobedience, NIGHT → the *time/season* of that hiddenness. Confirmed: 1Thess 5:5 — "not of the NIGHT, nor of DARKNESS" (NIGHT || DARKNESS). Rom 13:12 — "the NIGHT is far spent… cast off works of DARKNESS" (NIGHT + DARKNESS + LIGHT + DAY).

**Functional pattern** — NIGHT = season when:
- Opportunity closes: John 9:4 — "NIGHT cometh, when no man can work" → end of time for visible productive work; immediate (Jesus' ministry) + eschatological (repentance closes).
- Stumbling occurs: John 11:10 — walk in NIGHT → stumble, "no LIGHT in him" (NIGHT + LIGHT).
- SLEEP prevails: 1Thess 5:7 — "they that SLEEP sleep in the NIGHT" (NIGHT + SLEEP).
- Drunkenness prevails: 1Thess 5:7 — "drunken are drunken in the NIGHT" → impaired judgment, unawareness.
- Thievery/concealment: 1Thess 5:2 — "thief in the NIGHT"; 2Sam 12:12 — David's sin done secretly (metaphorical NIGHT).

**Thief-in-NIGHT pattern:** 1Thess 5:2 + 1Thess 5:4 + 2Pet 3:10 — DAY of the Lord comes as thief in NIGHT. Why thief at NIGHT? NIGHT provides cover for hidden action. Those in DARKNESS caught off guard; those of DAY are not. Judgment catches spiritually asleep/unaware.

**SLEEP + drunkenness association:** 1Thess 5:6-7 — "let us not SLEEP… watch and be sober." SLEEP → spiritual unconsciousness (NIGHT + SLEEP). Drunkenness → impaired judgment. Both occur "in the NIGHT" = season of hiddenness/unawareness.

**NIGHT vs DARKNESS distinction:** DARKNESS → the *state* of concealed disobedience. NIGHT → the *time/season* when that hiddenness prevails. NIGHT emphasizes temporal/seasonal aspect.

**Rejected alternatives:** "Nighttime hours" = physical only. "Concealed disobedience" = duplicates DARKNESS, misses time aspect. "Adversity" = partial, misses hiding/unawareness pattern.

**Human application:** 1Thess 5:5 — believers can BE "of the NIGHT" (negatively). Exhortation: come OUT of NIGHT → "watch and be sober" = opposite of NIGHT's characteristics (SLEEP, drunkenness).

**Substitution confirms:** Gen 1:5 DARKNESS → [Season of Hiddenness] ✓. John 9:4 NIGHT → [end of opportunity] ✓. 1Thess 5:5 NIGHT → [hiddenness] ✓. 1Thess 5:7 NIGHT → [unawareness/hiddenness] ✓. John 11:10 NIGHT → [hiddenness] ✓. Rom 13:12 NIGHT → [season of hiddenness] ✓.

**Subj:** NIGHT → hiddenness (state) + unawareness (condition) + closed opportunity (temporal). Opposite: DAY → Exposure / Time of Accountability.
