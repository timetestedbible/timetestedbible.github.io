## STUB — Awaiting full symbol-study

**DISTINCT FROM `babylon.md`:** babylon.md = the archetype/system (man's substitute for covenant rule). THIS study = the IDENTITY of the LAST Babylon. Who is she? What are the scriptural identification markers?

**DAN 2 STATUE = BABYLON'S COMPLETE HISTORY → FEET = BABYLON THE GREAT.**
Dan 2:31-45: Head of gold (Babylon), chest of silver (Medo-Persia), belly of bronze (Greece), legs of iron (Rome), feet of iron mixed with clay (LAST kingdom — divided, partly strong, partly brittle). The ENTIRE statue IS Babylon in successive forms — same system, different metals, degrading purity. The feet = the FINAL iteration = "the end" (telos) of the Babylon system. A STONE cut without hands strikes the FEET (not the head, not the legs — the LAST form) and the WHOLE statue shatters (Dan 2:34-35). The stone becomes a GREAT MOUNTAIN filling the whole earth (Dan 2:35,44-45). STONE = ROCK = Christ/covenant (symbols/rock). MOUNTAIN = Kingdom (symbols/mountain). The feet are where THE END arrives — the purpose/goal (telos) of God's covenant judgment terminates Babylon at its weakest, most divided iteration.

**DAN 4 TREE = BABYLON'S GLOBAL REACH.**
Dan 4:10-12,20-22: TREE reaching to heaven, visible to ALL THE EARTH, ALL beasts sheltered under it, ALL flesh fed by it. This IS the defining image of Babylon the Great's scope — not a single city but a system sheltering/controlling ALL nations. Cut down for 7 times (Dan 4:16,25) = 7 years = tribulation. Stump preserved with band of iron+brass (Dan 4:15,23) = system restrained but not annihilated (cf. Dan 2 iron+clay feet). King goes to-and-fro eating GRASS (= consuming peoples, Isa 40:6-7). Eagle feathers + bird claws (Dan 4:33) = raven-king, militaristic but gone feral. See contexts/Dan/4.001-037.md for full integration.

**IRON THREAD: Dan 2 legs of IRON → feet of IRON mixed with clay → Dan 4 stump bound with IRON + brass.** The iron = Rome's DNA persisting into the final form. Babylon the Great carries Rome's structural framework (law, military, governance) mixed with something brittle (clay = H2635 chasaph, Aramaic = pottery/brittle). Iron+clay don't mix (Dan 2:43) = system that cannot cohere. G7/NATO = alliance of strong military powers that cannot truly unify.

**IDENTIFICATION MARKERS FROM SCRIPTURE:**

1. **Economic dominance** — merchants were "great men of the earth" (Rev 18:23). Imports all manner of goods (Rev 18:11-13). Maritime trade (Rev 18:17-19). Nations enriched by her (Rev 18:3,19).
2. **Military reach** — seizes dwellings not their own, sweeps across whole earth (Hab 1:6). Destroys nations without sparing (Hab 1:17). Law unto themselves (Hab 1:7).
3. **Eagle symbol** — flies like an eagle swooping to devour (Hab 1:8).
4. **Many cities** — NOT a single city. "I will kindle a fire in his cities" (Jer 50:32). Divided into THREE PARTS (Rev 16:19). Seven mountains/nations (Rev 17:9).
5. **Rules through currency** — waters = peoples, multitudes, nations, tongues (Rev 17:15). Economic coercion mechanism.
6. **Destroyed by creditors** — "will not your creditors suddenly arise?" (Hab 2:7-8).
7. **Destroyed by 10 nations** — ten horns hate harlot, burn with fire (Rev 17:16-17). Give their kingdom to beast for "one hour."
8. **Enemies: lion, bear, serpent** — Amos 5:18-20. Jer 4:7 lion from thicket. Nation from the NORTH attacks (Jer 50:3).
9. **Statue feet = LAST form** — Dan 2:33-34,41-43. Iron mixed with clay. Partly strong, partly broken. Cannot cohere. Struck at the FEET by the stone. The end (telos) arrives here.
10. **Tree spanning whole earth** — Dan 4:10-12,20-22. All beasts/nations under its shadow. All flesh fed. Cut for 7 times. Stump bound with iron+brass.

**DAN 9 = THE TIMETABLE FOR BABYLON THE GREAT'S DESTRUCTION.**
**CRITICAL: See words/DANIEL-9.md (826-line word-by-word consonantal Hebrew study) + data/translation-patches.json (6 active patches) + numbers/70.md + numbers/490.md + words/H369.md + words/H6256.md.**

ALTERNATIVE TRANSLATION (from consonantal Hebrew, pre-Masoretic pointing):
- Dan 9:24: שבעים שבעים = IDENTICAL consonants repeated = "seventy seventy" = 70 jubilees (not "70 weeks"). From Jordan crossing 1406 BC + (70 × 49) = **2024 AD**. Six covenant-completion goals must ALL be fulfilled within this timeframe.
- Dan 9:25: שבעים שבעה = "seventy sevens" = 490 years (not "seven weeks" + "sixty-two weeks"). 457 BC + 490 = ~33 AD = Messiah. Then ושבעים ששים ושנים = "jubilee sixty and again [the decree]" = 60th jubilee (1406 BC + 2940 = 1535 AD = Suleiman rebuilds Jerusalem, exactly as Isa 60:10 prophesied: "sons of strangers shall build thy walls"). Definite article הַ on עתים = THE appointed times (H6256, only 4× with article in all Scripture — see words/H6256.md).
- Dan 9:26: Messiah CUTS covenant (H3772 karath = active, THE covenant verb, 78× with ברית) — NOT "cut off" (passive). Then VANISHES (H369 אין = Enoch pattern, divine removal — see words/H369.md) — to himself, the CITY (H5892 עיר from H5782 עור = the WATCHFUL people) and the HOLY (הקדש = both "the set-apart" AND "he will sanctify them" in Hiphil). HE will destroy (ישחית = 3ms singular, NOT plural "they") the people of the coming ruler. Messiah is subject THROUGHOUT.
- Dan 9:27: גבר (H1396 = strengthen/confirm) the covenant already CUT in v26. Marriage pattern: betrothal (cut, v26) → groom departs (vanish) → groom returns (strengthen, v27) = wedding supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:7-9).

Babylon the Great's appointed termination is encoded in this timetable: 70 jubilees = the covenant deadline. "Unto the end, war, desolations determined" (v26) = Babylon's wars persist until THE END. "Even until the consummation" (H3617 kalah v27) = complete destruction poured on the desolator = Babylon the Great destroyed.

**NEEDS:** Full exhaustive study following methodology. Search every occurrence of "great city" (G3173+G4172), "mystery" (G3466) in Rev context, "mother of harlots." Dan 2 full integration (statue metals, iron+clay, stone→mountain). Dan 4 tree-scope connection. Dan 9 timetable integration (70 weeks/jubilees, Messiah cut off, prince that shall come, consummation). Habakkuk 1-2 full integration. Amos 5 integration. Jer 50-51 identification markers. Generate 7+ candidate identities and test against ALL markers.
