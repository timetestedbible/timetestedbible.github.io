## 8. DISTINGUISHING FEATURES — NARROWING THE IDENTITY

These are properties that distinguish Babylon the Great from historical Babylon (Mesopotamia/Iraq). Any candidate must match ALL of these:

### A. She has MULTIPLE CITIES (Jer 50:32, 51:43, Rev 16:19)
- Historical Babylon was one city. This Babylon has CITIES (plural) and is divided into THREE PARTS.

### B. She is the "hindermost [youngest/last] of the nations" (Jer 50:12)
- Historical Babylon was one of the OLDEST civilizations. This one is specifically called the LAST.

### C. She dwells upon "many waters" with maritime trade (Jer 51:13, Rev 18:17-19)
- Historical Babylon was an inland desert city on the Euphrates with no ocean access. This Babylon has shipmasters, sailors, and all who trade by sea.

### D. She makes "all nations" drunk through her cup (Jer 51:7, Rev 14:8, Rev 18:3)
- Not merely regional power — GLOBAL influence over ALL nations.

### E. She is the world's dominant MERCHANT power (Rev 18:3,11,15,19,23)
- Her merchants are the "great men of the earth." ALL who have ships are made rich by her.

### F. She rules over "kings of the earth" (Rev 17:18)
- Not merely one kingdom — she reigns OVER kings.

### G. Her waters = "peoples, multitudes, nations, tongues" (Rev 17:15)
- Multi-ethnic, multi-lingual empire.

### H. She "ladeth herself with thick clay" = debt (Hab 2:6)
- Then creditors rise SUDDENLY against her (Hab 2:7).

### I. She flies as the EAGLE to devour (Hab 1:8)
- Eagle symbol specifically associated with her military.

### J. She is a "proud man who keepeth not at home" (Hab 2:5)
- Military deployed abroad, not domestic. Seizes foreign dwellings (Hab 1:6).

### K. She catches nations in her NET and worships the net (Hab 1:15-16)
- Economic/military system that captures nations, and she credits the SYSTEM rather than God.

### L. She scoffs at kings and princes (Hab 1:10)
- Derides foreign leadership and strongholds.

### M. Her judgment reaches unto heaven (Rev 18:5, Jer 51:9)
- Scale of sin = global.

### N. "Blood of ALL that were slain upon the earth" found in her (Rev 18:24)
- Responsible for more death than any other entity.

### O. Trades in "slaves and souls of men" (Rev 18:13)
- Human trafficking / slavery as part of her commerce.

### P. Seven mountains / seven kings (Rev 17:9-10)
- Five fallen, one is, one not yet come = a SUCCESSION of forms.

### Q. "Destroyed in one hour" (Rev 18:10,17,19)
- Total economic collapse in extreme brevity.

### R. Ten horns/kings destroy her (Rev 17:16-17)
- God puts it in THEIR hearts. Her own allies turn on her.

### S. "My battle axe" — GOD uses her to break nations (Jer 51:20-23)
- God raised her as His instrument of judgment on other nations.

### T. Sits in the wilderness (Rev 17:3)
- Or viewed from the perspective of the wilderness.

### U. "Mount up to heaven, fortify the height of her strength" (Jer 51:53)
- Aerospace/military dominance reaching skyward.

### V. Her destruction: like Sodom/Gomorrah (Jer 50:40, Isa 13:19)
- Sudden fire from above, never inhabited again.

## 9. DAN 2 STATUE — THE STRUCTURAL POSITION OF BABYLON THE GREAT

**Dan 2:31-45: FEET = BABYLON THE GREAT.**

- Head of gold = Babylon (Dan 2:38)
- Chest of silver = Medo-Persia
- Belly of bronze = Greece
- Legs of iron = Rome
- Feet of iron+clay = LAST kingdom

The ENTIRE statue IS Babylon in successive forms — same system, different metals, degrading purity. The feet = FINAL iteration = "the end" of the Babylon system.

- **Dan 2:33** — feet "part of iron and part of clay"
- **Dan 2:41-43** — "partly strong, and partly broken... they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay"
- **Dan 2:34-35** — STONE cut without hands strikes the FEET and the WHOLE statue shatters
- **Dan 2:44-45** — "God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed... it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms"

Iron = Rome's DNA persisting. Clay = brittle, cannot cohere. Iron+clay don't mix = divided alliance.

## 10. DAN 4 TREE — BABYLON'S GLOBAL REACH

- **Dan 4:10-12** — TREE reaching to heaven, visible to ALL THE EARTH. ALL beasts sheltered under it. ALL flesh fed by it.
- **Dan 4:20-22** — "the tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth... It is thou, O king"
- **Dan 4:16,25** — cut down for "seven times" = 7 years. Stump preserved with band of iron+brass (Dan 4:15,23).
- **Dan 4:33** — king goes feral: "eagles' feathers... birds' claws" = eagle-king.

## 11. DAN 9 TIMETABLE

See words/DANIEL-9.md for complete study. Key integration:
- Dan 9:24: 70 jubilees = covenant deadline for Babylon the Great's termination
- Dan 9:26: "unto the end, war, desolations determined" = Babylon's wars persist until THE END
- Dan 9:27: "even until the consummation" (H3617 kalah) = complete destruction poured on the desolator = Babylon the Great destroyed

**NEXT STEPS:**
1. Test EVERY property against all historical/modern candidates
2. Generate 7+ candidate identities per methodology
3. Substitution test each candidate against the FULL checklist above
4. Properties that OVERLAP with multiple candidates → low discriminating power
5. Properties that ONLY ONE candidate matches → high discriminating power
6. The candidate matching ALL properties = the identification
