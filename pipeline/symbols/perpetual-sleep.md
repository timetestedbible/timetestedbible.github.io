**H8142** (שֵׁנָה shênâh) — sleep. From H3462 (יָשֵׁן yashen). KJV: "sleep." 23x OT.
**H8139** (שְׁנָה shᵉnâh) — Aramaic sleep, corresponding to H8142. Dan 2:1, 6:18.
**H3462** (יָשֵׁן yâshên) — to be slack/languid; by implication sleep; figuratively to die; also to grow old, stale, inveterate. KJV: "old (store), remain long, sleep." 19x OT.
**H5769** (עוֹלָם ʻôwlâm) — concealed; the vanishing point; time out of mind; practically eternity; perpetual. When combined with H8142: sleep that is H5769 = sleep with no visible end = DEATH.

## Context Bag

This study focuses on the SPECIFIC sub-pattern within SLEEP: judgment-death that comes THROUGH intoxication or false security. Distinct from general death-as-sleep (see `pipeline/symbols/sleep.md`) and distinct from simple spiritual drowsiness.

### A. THE DEFINING PASSAGES: Jer 51:39,57 — Perpetual Sleep of Babylon

Jer 51:39 — "In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken (H7937 shakar), that they may rejoice, and sleep (H3462 yashen) a perpetual (H5769 olam) sleep (H8142 shenah), and not wake (H6974 quts)." subj: Babylon's rulers. co: WINE+FEAST+BABYLON+DRUNKENNESS. spkr: YHWH. MECHANISM: God makes them drunk AT THEIR OWN FEAST → drunkenness produces sleep → sleep becomes perpetual (no waking) → death. The feasting/rejoicing is the TRAP. They celebrate while judgment falls.

Jer 51:57 — "I will make drunk (H7937) her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep (H3462) a perpetual (H5769) sleep (H8142), and not wake (H6974)." subj: Babylon's entire leadership class — princes, wise men, captains, rulers, mighty men. spkr: the King, LORD of hosts. Same mechanism repeated with expanded target list. ALL strata of Babylon's power structure fall to the same judgment. v.58: "broad walls utterly broken, high gates burned with fire." Physical destruction follows the stupor.

**PATTERN:** Intoxication → false joy/security → unconsciousness → irrevocable death. The drunk man doesn't know he's dying. Judgment arrives DURING celebration. Cf. Dan 5:1-4 — Belshazzar's feast: drinking wine from temple vessels while Medo-Persians diverted the river.

### B. THE 1 THESSALONIANS 5 CONNECTION

1Th 5:6-7 — "Let us not sleep (G2518 katheudō) as do others; but let us watch (grēgoreō) and be sober (nēphō). For they that sleep sleep in the NIGHT; and they that be drunken (G3182 methyskō) are drunken in the night." Paul EXPLICITLY pairs sleep and drunkenness in the night — identical structure to Jer 51. The "others" who sleep = those in NIGHT/DARKNESS (v.4-5). Paired with v.2-3: day of Lord as thief + sudden destruction + "peace and safety."

STRUCTURAL PARALLEL to Jer 51:
- Jer 51: Babylon's rulers drunk at feast → perpetual sleep → not wake → walls broken
- 1Th 5: Those in darkness drunk in night → sleeping → sudden destruction → no escape
- Both: intoxication → unconsciousness → irrevocable judgment

The link is NOT coincidental. Paul writes to Thessalonians about the day of the Lord using the EXACT Babylon-judgment vocabulary: drunk + sleep + night + sudden destruction. "Peace and safety" (1Th 5:3) = Babylon's feast-celebration (Jer 51:39 "rejoice").

### C. THE TEN VIRGINS — Mat 25:5

Mat 25:5 — "While the bridegroom tarried, they ALL slumbered (G3573 nystazō) and slept (G2518 katheudō)." co: BRIDEGROOM+VIRGIN+LAMP+OIL+NIGHT(midnight). BOTH wise and foolish sleep. The sleep itself is not the sin — the LACK OF OIL is. But the sleep creates the conditions for the crisis: when the cry comes at midnight, only the prepared can respond. The foolish discover their lamps going out AFTER they wake. The delay (tarrying) produces the sleep; the sleep reveals who prepared and who didn't.

CONNECTION to perpetual sleep: the foolish virgins' sleep leads to permanent exclusion ("I know you not" — v.12). Not physical death, but irrevocable judgment through unpreparedness during sleep.

### D. JUDGMENT-SLEEP IN THE OT

Psa 76:5-6 — "The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept (H5123 num) their sleep (H8142 shenah): and none of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep." subj: enemies of God. co: judgment. The mighty warriors sleep a sleep from which they cannot fight — hands useless, chariots stopped. MILITARY judgment rendered as sleep-paralysis.

Psa 13:3 — "lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the sleep of death (H4194 maveth)." subj: David. The "sleep of death" = eyes darkened → death. Literal connection: closing eyes = sleep → death.

Isa 29:10 — "the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep (H8639 tardemah), and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered." subj: Jerusalem/Israel. GOD HIMSELF pours out the sleep — judicial blindness. The very people who should SEE (prophets, seers) are PUT to sleep. This is PUNITIVE sleep: God gives them over to unconsciousness because they refused to see.

Nah 3:18 — "Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell in the dust." subj: Assyria's leadership. Shepherds asleep = nation unprotected → scattered flock on mountains. Leadership-sleep = national destruction.

Dan 12:2 — "many of them that sleep (H3463 yashen) in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt." subj: the dead. co: RESURRECTION+JUDGMENT. TWO outcomes from the same sleep: awakening to LIFE or awakening to SHAME. The sleep of death is not the final word — but the awakening brings judgment for some.

### E. WISDOM: DRUNKENNESS → SLEEP → DEATH CHAIN

Pro 23:31-35 — "Look not upon the wine… at the last it biteth like a serpent… thine eyes shall behold strange women… thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea… They have stricken me, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again." The drunkard is BEATEN and feels nothing (unconscious to pain), then upon waking SEEKS MORE WINE. The cycle: drink → stupor → unconsciousness to harm → wake → drink again. Perpetual sleep is this cycle taken to its terminal point.

### F. THE CONVERGENCE PATTERN

Three streams merge:

1. **BABYLON STREAM** (Jer 51): Physical rulers drunk at feast → perpetual sleep = death
2. **ESCHATOLOGICAL STREAM** (1Th 5): Spiritual darkness + drunkenness + sleep → sudden destruction
3. **WISDOM STREAM** (Pro 23, Isa 29): Intoxication → inability to perceive → judgment

All three share: INTOXICATION (literal or figurative) → UNCONSCIOUSNESS (sleep) → IRREVOCABLE CONSEQUENCE (death/destruction/exclusion).

**KEY DISTINCTION from general SLEEP:** Perpetual sleep is not simply death-as-euphemism. It is judgment that comes THROUGH the victim's own stupor. The drunk man at the feast, the spiritually asleep in darkness, the foolish virgin without oil — all are judged not by external attack but by their own unconsciousness at the critical moment. They don't FIGHT judgment; they sleep through it.

**MECHANISM:** False security (feast/celebration/"peace and safety") → intoxication (wine/worldly comfort/deception) → sleep (spiritual unawareness/literal stupor) → judgment arrives during sleep → no awakening = perpetual.

**CROSS-REFERENCE TO THIEF-IN-NIGHT:** The thief comes during sleep; perpetual sleep explains WHY they don't wake up — they are intoxicated. The thief-in-night image assumes the householder COULD have watched (Mat 24:43). Perpetual sleep reveals those who CAN'T watch because they're drunk. 1Th 5 joins both: thief (v.2) + sleep+drunk (v.6-7).

**BABYLON AS ARCHETYPE:** Jer 51 is the origin text. Babylon = the system that intoxicates nations (Rev 17:2 "drunk with the wine of her fornication"). Those drunk on Babylon's wine sleep Babylon's sleep. "Come out of her, my people" (Rev 18:4) = the call to WAKE UP before the perpetual sleep takes hold.
