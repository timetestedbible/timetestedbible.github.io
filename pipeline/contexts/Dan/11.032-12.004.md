## What the Pipeline Adds

**V32 TWO RESPONSES TO THE SAME PRESSURE = SKANDALIZO FORK.** "Such as do WICKEDLY (H7561 rasha = condemn/be wicked) against the covenant shall he CORRUPT (H2610 chaneph = pollute/profane) by FLATTERIES (H2514 chalaqah = smooth/slippery things)." Deceive study: H2514 = slippery persuasion, making covenant-violation attractive. "BUT the people that KNOW (H3045 yada = intimate experiential knowing) their God shall be STRONG (H2388 chazaq = seize/be firm) and DO (H6213 asah = produce/accomplish)." Same external pressure (flattery/persecution), TWO divergent outcomes: corrupted vs strengthened. Skandalizo-stumble study: G4625 skandalon = trigger-stick of a trap — external force activates internal weakness. The chalaqah (flatteries) IS the trigger-stick; the response depends on whether the person KNOWS (yada) God or merely affiliates. Chazaq = same verb used for angels seizing Lot's hand (Gen 19:16) — firmness/strength that overcomes natural hesitation.

**VV33-34 THE WISE INSTRUCT BUT FALL = COSTLY TESTIMONY.** "They that UNDERSTAND (H7919 sakal = prudent insight) among the people shall INSTRUCT (H995 biyn = cause to discern) many: yet they shall FALL (H3782 kashal = stumble!) by the SWORD, and by FLAME (H3852 lehabah = blade of fire), by CAPTIVITY (H7628 shebiy), and by SPOIL (H961 bizzah), many DAYS." Skandalizo study: H3782 kashal = THE stumble-word (65× OT). But here the wise stumble NOT from apostasy but from PERSECUTION — they fall while teaching. Fire study: lehabah = flame as weapon, not refining. Sword+flame+captivity+spoil = FOUR modes of opposition. V34: "when they fall, they shall be holpen with a LITTLE (H4592 me'at = small/few) help; but many shall cleave to them with FLATTERIES (H2514 chalaqah — same word as v32)." The "little help" is ambiguous — possibly Maccabean aid, possibly a theological statement: the help is DELIBERATELY small because the falling-while-teaching is purposeful (v35 explains). Flattery-followers attach to the wise movement but without genuine transformation.

**V35 "SOME OF UNDERSTANDING SHALL FALL TO TRY, PURGE, MAKE WHITE" = FIRE'S REFINING MODE APPLIED TO PERSONS.** H6884 tsaraph (refine) + H1305 barar (purify/select) + H3835 laban (make white). Three verbs: refine (fire-metallurgy) + purify (selection/separation) + whiten (moral cleansing). Fire study: H6884 tsaraph = Mal 3:2-3 "refiner's fire... refine sons of Levi" = Zech 13:9 "refine as silver." The falling of the wise is NOT defeat but REFINEMENT — their stumbling-under-persecution IS the refining fire. Dan 12:10 repeats these EXACT three verbs: "many shall be PURIFIED (barar), and made WHITE (laban), and TRIED (tsaraph)." Same process, same vocabulary, 11:35 and 12:10 = same event described twice. "EVEN TO THE TIME OF THE END (H6256 eth + H7093 qets): because it is yet for a TIME APPOINTED (H4150 mo'ed = appointed meeting/festival)." The-end study: qets = cutting-point from H7112 qatsats (cut off). The refining continues UNTIL the appointed cutting. Mo'ed = same word for Israel's feasts (Lev 23). The end IS an appointed festival.

**DAN 11:36-39 THE WILLFUL KING = SYSTEM, NOT PERSON.** "The king shall do according to his OWN WILL (H7522 ratson = pleasure/desire)... EXALT himself above every god... speak MARVELOUS THINGS (H6381 pala = extraordinary/surpassing) against the God of gods... prosper TILL THE INDIGNATION (H2195 za'am) be accomplished." V37: "nor regard the God of his fathers, nor the DESIRE OF WOMEN (H2532 chemdah + H802 ishshah)... magnify himself ABOVE ALL." V38: "honour the GOD OF FORCES (H4581 ma'oz = stronghold/fortress)." He replaces the God of covenant with the god of POWER-STRUCTURES. "Desire of women" likely = the messianic hope (what women desired = to bear the Messiah). The willful king discards messianic expectation, exalts force-structures, prospers until God's za'am (measured anger) completes its purpose. This is Babylon's character-essence: self-will replacing covenant-will, force-worship replacing God-worship.

**DAN 11:40-45 "AT THE TIME OF THE END" = THE QETS-ERA CAMPAIGN.** V40 "at the TIME OF THE END (eth qets)... king of the south shall PUSH (H5055 nagach = gore like a bull)... king of the north shall come like a WHIRLWIND (H8175 sa'ar = storm/tempest)." North/south conflict resumes at the qets. V45 "plant the tabernacles of his palace BETWEEN THE SEAS in the glorious holy MOUNTAIN" — between seas + on the mountain = claiming the covenant geography. "Yet he shall come to HIS END (H7093 qets), and NONE shall help him." The willful king reaches his own qets (cutting-point) — the system collapses. He has his own end within THE end.

**DAN 12:1-4 = HARVEST + SEAL + TO-AND-FRO CONVERGENCE.** V1: Michael stands up → "time of TROUBLE (H6869 tsarah) such as never was since there was a NATION (H1471 goy)" = unique event. "Thy people DELIVERED, every one found WRITTEN IN THE BOOK (H5612 sepher)" = seal study Mode D (protection). V2: "many that SLEEP (H3463 yashen) in dust shall AWAKE (H6974 quts)" — dual harvest: "some to EVERLASTING LIFE (H5769 olam + H2416 chay), some to SHAME (H2781 cherpah) and everlasting CONTEMPT (H1860 dera'on)." Harvest study: the appointed separation. V3: "the WISE (H7919 sakal — SAME word as 11:33,35) shall shine as the BRIGHTNESS (H2096 zohar) of the firmament." The wise from 11:33 who instructed many + fell by sword NOW shine as stars. Their falling was NOT failure but seedtime; their shining IS the harvest. V4: "shut up the words, SEAL (H2856 chatham) the book, to the TIME OF THE END (eth qets)." Seal study: Mode C (restraint/concealment). "Many shall run TO AND FRO (H7751 shuwt), and KNOWLEDGE (H1847 da'ath) shall be INCREASED (H7235 rabah)." To-and-fro study: Dan 12:4 knowledge-increase + Amos 8:12 word-famine = SAME verb (shuwt), SAME era, OPPOSITE outcomes. Human knowledge explodes while divine word vanishes.

**11:33 → 12:3 ARC = THE SAKAL-JOURNEY.** The wise (H7919 sakal) appear 3× in this passage: 11:33 "they that understand shall INSTRUCT many," 11:35 "some of understanding shall fall," 12:3 "they that be wise shall SHINE." Instruct → fall → shine. The trajectory is not defeat but transfiguration: teaching provokes persecution, persecution produces refinement, refinement yields glory. Mat 13:43 "then shall the righteous SHINE FORTH as the SUN in the kingdom of their Father" = Dan 12:3 at fulfillment scale. The wise are defined not by knowledge alone but by COSTLY TEACHING that endures through the falling.

## Recommended Studies

- **SKANDALIZO-STUMBLE** — 11:33-35's "wise shall FALL (H3782 kashal)" uses the exact OT stumble-word. The skandalizo study traces kashal through Isa 8:14-15 "many shall STUMBLE and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken" — a compound trap-chain. But Dan 11:35 reframes the stumble: some fall TO BE REFINED. The same kashal that is catastrophic in Isa 8:15 is PURPOSEFUL in Dan 11:35. The study's core mechanism — external pressure activating internal weakness — still applies, but for the wise, the internal "weakness" is willingness to teach at personal cost.

- **THE-END** — H7093 qets appears in 11:35 (time of the end), 11:40 (at the time of the end), 11:45 (his end), and 12:4 (time of the end). Four occurrences in 20 verses — the densest qets-cluster outside Dan 12:4-13. The-end study's key finding: qets from H7112 qatsats (cut off), sharing root-domain with H7105 qatsir (HARVEST) from H7114 qatsar (cut/sever). The end IS a harvest — a cutting. Dan 11:32-12:4 enacts this: the wise are cut (kashal, v33-35), the wicked are cut (v45 "come to his end"), the sleepers are cut into two destinies (12:2). Everything in this passage is CUTTING.

- **TO-AND-FRO** — 12:4's "many shall run to and fro, knowledge increased" sounds like information age, but the study pairs it with Amos 8:12 "run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, shall NOT FIND IT." Same verb (H7751 shuwt), same era, opposite outcomes. The critical discovery: human da'ath (knowledge/information) INCREASES while divine dabar (revelatory word) becomes UNFINDABLE. The sealed book of Dan 12:4 is the resolution — its unsealing (Rev 22:10 "seal NOT") makes the word findable again. Dan 12:4's knowledge-explosion is not a blessing but a symptom of the word-famine.
