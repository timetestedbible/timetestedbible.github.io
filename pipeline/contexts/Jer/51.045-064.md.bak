## Context Integration Notes

### "COME OUT" CHAIN — Extraction Before Judgment
v45 "My people, go ye out of the midst of her" → Jer 51:6 → Isa 52:11 → 2 Cor 6:17 → Rev 18:4 (verbatim quote)
Pattern: God extracts covenant people before destroying embedded system = RAPTURE_GATHERING principle

### RULER AGAINST RULER → WARS/RUMORS 
v46 "ruler against ruler" = OT source for Mat 24:6-7 "wars/rumors" + "nation against nation"
Jeremiah: context of Babylon's fall || Jesus: BIRTH_PAINS preceding Jerusalem destruction
Same vocabulary, different cycles

### STONE INTO EUPHRATES → MILLSTONE INTO SEA
vv63-64: stone + book → Euphrates → "Babylon sink, shall not rise"
Rev 18:21: millstone → sea → "Babylon thrown down, found no more"
Escalation: stone → millstone || river → sea
Jeremiah = prophetic-oracle origin of CAST_INTO_SEA pattern

### PERPETUAL SLEEP (NEW SYMBOL)
v57 "sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake" (+ v39)
WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION chain: judgment through intoxication/stupor
Dan 5 = narrative fulfillment (Belshazzar feast→death that night)
Links 1 Thess 5:3-7: sudden destruction on those who SLEEP

### HEAVEN/EARTH CELEBRATION
v48 "Heaven and earth...shall sing for Babylon" → Rev 18:20 "Rejoice over her, thou heaven"
Direct quotation. Cosmic scale indicates trans-historical fulfillment

### MOUNT UP TO HEAVEN (NEW SYMBOL)
v53 "mount up to heaven...fortify the height" echoes Gen 11:4 Babel tower
Human ambition to reach heaven by effort = founding→final boast bookend

### REV 18 QUOTATION AUDIT
Nine direct chains from Jer 51→Rev 18:
51:6,45 "come out" → 18:4 verbatim || 51:9 judgment→heaven → 18:5 sins→heaven
51:8 suddenly fallen → 18:2 via Isa 21:9 || 51:7 golden cup → 17:4+18:3
51:48 heaven sing → 18:20 || 51:63-64 stone sink → 18:21 millstone
51:57 perpetual sleep → 18:8 one day death || 51:58 fire → 18:8 burned
51:49 slain all earth → 18:24 blood all slain
Rev 18 = Jer 51 rewritten at cosmic scale

### FULFILLMENT AUDIT: 539 BC vs UNFULFILLED
539 BC fulfilled PATTERN: people out (Cyrus decree), rulers fell (Belshazzar), spoilers from north (Medes), sudden feast-fall (Dan 5)
NOT fulfilled SCALE: desolate forever, shall not rise, walls broken, burned with fire, cosmic celebration
Gap = what Rev 18 fills: global Babylon-system full fulfillment

### SYMBOL CONVERGENCE MAP
BABYLON→WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION→CAST_INTO_SEA→FIRE→EARTHQUAKE
Simultaneously: WARS_AND_RUMORS+NATION_AGAINST_NATION precede fall as warning signs (Mat 24:6-8)
Contains entire judgment sequence Mat 24 + Rev 18 draw from

### JER 25:10 TRANSFER PATTERN
"Voice bridegroom/bride + millstones + candle" formula: first against JUDAH (Jer 7:34,16:9,25:10) → Rev 18:22-23 against Babylon
Covenant-judgment vocabulary transfers from unfaithful bride to corrupting harlot

- Queue Dan 5:1-31 (Belshazzar feast = narrative fulfillment)
- Queue Jer 50:1-51:44 (companion oracle context)
- Stone carries prophetic WORD = weight that sinks Babylon
- WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION as sequence pattern
