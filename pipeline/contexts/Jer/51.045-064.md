## "COME OUT" CHAIN — Extraction Before Judgment
v45 "My people, go ye out" → Jer 51:6 → Isa 52:11 → 2 Cor 6:17 → Rev 18:4 (verbatim)
Pattern: [G] extracts covenant people before destroying embedded system = RAPTURE_GATHERING principle

## RULER AGAINST RULER → WARS/RUMORS
v46 "ruler against ruler" = OT source for Mat 24:6-7 "wars/rumors" + NATION_AGAINST_NATION
Jeremiah: ctx: BABYLON fall || Jesus: BIRTH_PAINS preceding Jerusalem destruction

## STONE INTO EUPHRATES → MILLSTONE INTO SEA
vv63-64: stone + book → Euphrates → "Babylon sink, shall not rise"
Rev 18:21: millstone → SEA → "Babylon thrown down, found no more"
Escalation: stone → millstone || river → SEA. Jeremiah = origin of CAST_INTO_SEA pattern

## PERPETUAL_SLEEP (New Symbol)
v57 "sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake" (+ v39)
WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION chain: judgment through intoxication/stupor
Dan 5 = narrative fulfillment (Belshazzar feast→death that night)
Links 1 Thess 5:3-7: SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION on those who SLEEP
PERPETUAL_SLEEP ≠ general SLEEP (death-by-stupor)

## HEAVEN/EARTH CELEBRATION
v48 "[H] and earth...shall sing for Babylon" → Rev 18:20 "Rejoice over her, thou [H]" (direct quotation)
Cosmic scale → trans-historical fulfillment

## MOUNT_UP_TO_HEAVEN (New Symbol)
v53 "mount up to [H]...fortify the height" echoes Gen 11:4 Babel tower
Human ambition to reach [H] by effort = founding→final boast bookend
Gen 11:4 + Jer 51:53 = MOUNT_UP_TO_HEAVEN pattern

## REV 18 QUOTATION AUDIT
Nine direct chains Jer 51→Rev 18:
51:6,45 "come out" → 18:4 || 51:9 judgment→[H] → 18:5 sins→[H]
51:8 suddenly fallen → 18:2 (via Isa 21:9) || 51:7 golden cup → 17:4+18:3
51:48 [H] sing → 18:20 || 51:63-64 stone sink → 18:21 millstone
51:57 perpetual sleep → 18:8 one day death || 51:58 FIRE → 18:8 burned
51:49 slain all earth → 18:24 blood all slain
Rev 18 = Jer 51 rewritten at cosmic scale

## FULFILLMENT AUDIT: 539 BC vs UNFULFILLED
539 BC fulfilled PATTERN: people out (Cyrus decree), rulers fell (Belshazzar), spoilers from north (Medes), sudden feast-fall (Dan 5)
∅ fulfilled SCALE: desolate forever, shall not rise, walls broken, burned with FIRE, cosmic celebration
Gap = what Rev 18 fills: global BABYLON-system full fulfillment

## JER 25:10 TRANSFER PATTERN
"Voice bridegroom/bride + millstones + candle" formula:
First against JUDAH (Jer 7:34,16:9,25:10) → Rev 18:22-23 against BABYLON
Covenant-judgment vocabulary transfers: unfaithful bride → corrupting harlot

## SYMBOL CONVERGENCE MAP
BABYLON→WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION→CAST_INTO_SEA→FIRE→EARTHQUAKE
Simultaneously: WARS_AND_RUMORS+NATION_AGAINST_NATION precede fall as warning signs (Mat 24:6-8)
Contains entire judgment sequence Mat 24 + Rev 18 draw from
Stone carries prophetic WORD = weight that sinks BABYLON
WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION as sequence pattern

Queue: Dan 5:1-31 (Belshazzar feast), Jer 50:1-51:44 (companion oracle)

## Phase 2 Propagation

**ISA 34:8 → RIYB VOCABULARY CHAIN.** Jer 51:36 "I will plead (H7378 riyb) THY CAUSE" uses identical legal-dispute vocabulary as Isa 34:8 "day of the LORD's vengeance, year of recompences for the RIYB of Zion." The Isa 34 context identifies this as JUDICIAL — the sword executes a VERDICT, the cherem is a SENTENCE, the sacrifice is RESTITUTION. Jer 51's Babylon destruction is the same LITIGATION: God as prosecutor, Babylon as defendant, destruction as execution of sentence. The riyb chain (Isa 34:8 → Jer 51:36 → Mic 6:2 → Hos 4:1) reveals Babylon's fall isn't wrath-explosion but covenant-lawsuit completion.

**ISA 47 → WOMAN-FACE OF SAME BABYLON.** Isa 47 context documents the personified Babylon-woman who says "I am, and none else" (v8). Jer 51 is the political/military oracle; Isa 47 is the self-deifying woman. Together: Jer 51:7 "golden cup in LORD's hand" = Isa 47:6 "I gave them into thine hand." Babylon served AS God's instrument (Jer 25:9 executor), then became the target (Jer 50:21 cherem). The cherem study traces: executor→cherem = Babylon who delivered the ban now receives it. Isa 47:9 "in a MOMENT, in one day" = Jer 51:8 "Babylon is SUDDENLY fallen" — same event, one as woman, one as kingdom.

**1TH 5:3-7 → PERPETUAL-SLEEP = NT VOCABULARY.** The perpetual-sleep study (built from Jer 51:39,57) traces directly into Paul: Jer 51:57 "sleep a perpetual sleep" → 1Th 5:6-7 "they that sleep sleep in the NIGHT; they that be DRUNKEN are drunken in the night" → 1Th 5:3 SUDDEN DESTRUCTION. G3639 olethros (1Th 5:3) = LXX vocabulary of Isa 47:11 (H7722+H6365), which is the companion-oracle to Jer 51. Paul doesn't merely allude — he imports Babylon-oracle vocabulary into eschatological instruction. The WINE→SLEEP→SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION chain mapped in this context is the precise mechanism Paul warns against.

**ISA 24:20 → DRUNKARD-EARTH = BABYLON'S WINE AT COSMIC SCALE.** Isa 24:20 "earth reels like a drunkard" links directly to Jer 51:7 "Babylon hath been a golden cup... the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are MAD." The Isa 24 context notes: WINE + EARTHQUAKE converge — the planet itself is intoxicated on Babylon's wine and staggers. Isa 24:10 "city of tohu" = Gen 1:2 chaos, same de-creation pattern as Jer 51's "desolate forever." The two passages share the same structural arc: Babylon intoxicates nations → entire earth-system staggers → total de-creation. Isa 24:22 adds the TIME-GAP element (authorities imprisoned "after many days visited") absent from Jer 51.

**JOEL 3:19 → BLOOD-GUILT = JER 51:49.** Joel 3:19 "Egypt shall be desolation, Edom a desolate wilderness, for the VIOLENCE against the children of Judah, because they shed INNOCENT BLOOD." Jer 51:49 "as Babylon hath caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon shall fall the slain of ALL THE EARTH." Both: Babylon-type systems destroyed specifically for BLOOD-GUILT. The blood study confirms: shed blood SPEAKS (Gen 4:10, Heb 12:24), ACCUMULATES (Rev 18:24 "in her found blood of ALL slain"), and requires ACCOUNTING (Rev 16:6 "gave them blood to drink"). Jer 51:49's "all the earth" = Rev 18:24's "all slain on earth" — Babylon holds the total ledger of blood-guilt.
