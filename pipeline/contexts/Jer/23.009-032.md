## FALSE PROPHETS ORACLE — SOURCE FOR MAT 24:4-5,11,24

Jesus's first and most repeated warning in the Olivet Discourse: "take heed that no man G4105 planao you" (Mat 24:4) + "many false prophets shall arise and G4105 many" (24:11,24). Jer 23 = the OT oracle He draws from. Same verb chain: H8582 ta'ah (Jer 23:13,32) → LXX πλανάω → G4105 (Mat 24).

## JEREMIAH DRUNK ON GOD'S WORD (v9)

"Like a DRUNKEN man [H7910], like a man whom WINE [H3196] hath overcome, because of the LORD and because of the WORDS of his holiness." WINE study: wine = covenant blood. Jeremiah is overwhelmed by God's covenant-word — intoxicated by holiness, not by Babylon's cup. CONTRAST: Jer 51:7 Babylon's golden cup makes nations drunk (covenant-blood perverted). Same symbol (wine), opposite source. True prophet overwhelmed by God's word; false prophets pour Babylon's wine on the people.

## TWO PROPHET TYPES — SAMARIA vs JERUSALEM (vv13-14)

v13: Samaria's prophets — H8604 tiphlah = FOLLY. Prophesied in BAAL [H1168]. Caused [H8582 ta'ah = DECEIVE] Israel to err. v14: Jerusalem's prophets — H8186 sha'ariyrah = HORRIBLE thing. Commit H5003 na'aph (adultery) + walk in H8267 sheqer (lies). WORSE than Samaria: "strengthen the hands of evildoers that NONE returns from his wickedness [H7451]." Jerusalem's prophets = Sodom/Gomorrah.

Escalation: Samaria's error = wrong god (Baal). Jerusalem's horror = right Name, wrong character. They use YHWH's name to authorize covenant violation. Third-commandment violation: carrying the Name in vain. Worse because it corrupts the remedy itself.

## "YE SHALL HAVE PEACE" (v17) — FALSE-PEACE CHAIN

"They say unto them that DESPISE [H5006 na'ats = spurn/contemn] me, The LORD hath said, ye shall have SHALOM [H7965]." This = Jer 6:14 applied to individuals: peace pronounced on covenant-DESPISERS. The false-peace chain: Jer 6:14 (general wound) → 23:17 (targeted to despisers) → Ezek 13:10 (cosmetic wall) → Mic 3:5 (peace-for-hire) → 1Th 5:3 (eschatological climax). v17 adds: the recipients ACTIVELY despise God. Not ignorant — contemptuous. Shalom given to those whose stance guarantees its impossibility.

## GOD'S COUNSEL vs OWN HEART (vv16-22)

v16: "vision of their OWN HEART [H3820], not out of the MOUTH of the LORD." v18: "who hath STOOD in the COUNSEL [H5475 cowd] of the LORD?" v21: "I have NOT SENT them, yet they ran; I have NOT SPOKEN to them, yet they prophesied." v22: "if they had STOOD in my counsel, they would have TURNED [H7725 shuv] people from evil."

H5475 cowd = intimate circle, secret council, assembly of confidants. The test: did you stand in God's cowd? True prophet → access to God's council → word turns people FROM evil. False prophet → own heart → word STRENGTHENS evil (v14). The function determines the source. If the message doesn't produce teshuvah (turning/repentance), the source isn't God.

## LATTER DAYS CLAUSE (v20)

"In the H319 achariyth days ye shall consider it perfectly [H998 biynah = understanding]." H319 achariyth = the END, latter part, final outcome. This oracle has a future dimension: the false-prophet pattern isn't confined to Jeremiah's era. It recurs in the achariyth. Jesus confirms: Mat 24:11,24 "many false prophets" in the end-time birth-pains sequence.

## WORD AS FIRE + HAMMER (v29)

"Is not my word like as FIRE [H784 esh]? and like a HAMMER [H6360 pattiysh] that breaketh the ROCK [H5553 cela'] in pieces?" FIRE study: God's word = covenant standard in active contact. The word doesn't just inform — it BURNS what violates covenant (consuming) and BREAKS what resists (hammer on rock). H5553 cela' = cliff/crag — not H6697 tsur (covenant-rock), but H5553 = natural rock, resistant material. God's word shatters what is merely hard. The false prophets' words = H8401 chaff (v28); God's word = fire + hammer. Two categories of speech: one weightless, one devastating.

## CHAFF vs WHEAT (v28)

"What is the CHAFF [H8401 teben] to the WHEAT [H1250 bar]?" Rhetorical: they are incomparable. False dreams (chaff) vs God's word (wheat). H8401 teben = straw/stubble — FIRE study's fuel category (1Cor 3:12 wood/hay/stubble consumed). H1250 bar = grain, threshed clean. The chaff/wheat separation = HARVEST pattern (Mat 3:12 "gather wheat... burn chaff with unquenchable fire"). Jeremiah anticipates the separation mechanism Jesus and John announce.

## NAME-FORGETTING MECHANISM (v27)

"Cause my people to forget my NAME [H8034 shem] by their DREAMS... as their fathers forgot my NAME for BAAL [H1168]." The mechanism: substitute content (dreams for word, Baal for YHWH) → covenant identity erased. H8034 shem = identity, character, covenant marker. NAME-forgetting = covenant-forgetting. The false prophets don't deny God EXISTS — they replace His character with their projections. Same name, different god.

## STRUCTURAL PARALLEL TO MIC 3 + EZEK 13

Jer 23:13 H8582 ta'ah = Mic 3:5 H8582 ta'ah = Ezek 13:10 H8582 ta'ah. Same verb, same accusation, three prophets. Jer 23:17 "ye shall have peace" = Jer 6:14 = Ezek 13:10,16 = Mic 3:5 "cry peace." The false-prophet/false-peace oracle is a single sustained prophetic tradition across Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Micah. Jesus inherits and finalizes it in Mat 24.

## Recommended Studies

- **Deceive** — H8582 ta'ah in v13 and v32 is the EXACT Hebrew root behind G4105 planao in Mat 24:4-5. The study traces the path-departure metaphor from Genesis through Revelation. What Jeremiah calls "caused my people to err" is what Jesus calls "take heed no one lead you astray." Same mechanism, same verb, same warning — 600 years apart. The deceive study shows this isn't a metaphor: it's the literal mechanism of covenant departure (wandering from THE WAY).
- **Fire** — v29 "Is not my word like fire?" is one of the DEFINING VERSES of the fire symbol. The study proves fire = God's covenant standard in active contact. Same fire refines genuine material and destroys counterfeit. The false prophets' words are chaff (v28); God's word is fire (v29). When fire meets chaff: 1Cor 3:12-15. Jer 23:29 establishes that God's word IS the testing standard, not a description of punishment.
- **Peace / Shalom** — v17 adds a critical dimension to the false-peace chain: shalom pronounced on those who H5006 na'ats (spurn/contemn) God. The peace-shalom study traces H7999 shalam through every OT/NT context and proves false peace = declaring covenant-wholeness while covenant is shattered. Jer 23:17 = the most extreme case: peace guaranteed to active contemners. This is the mechanism 1Th 5:3 makes eschatological.
