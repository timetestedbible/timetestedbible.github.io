## Context Integration

**STRUCTURE**: 4:13-18 comfort re: dead → 5:1-11 exhortation re: living = ONE event, two audiences
**SLEEP PIVOT**: 4:13-15 SLEEP = death G2837 koimaō || 5:6-7 SLEEP = spiritual unawareness G2518 katheudō
5:10 "wake/sleep" bridges both senses → all live with him regardless

**TRUMPET CONVERGENCE**: 4:16 "trump of God" aligns:
- 1Cor 15:52 "last trump" (resurrection)
- Matt 24:31 "great trumpet" (gathering)  
- Isa 27:13 great trumpet (covenant ingathering)
- Lev 25:9 Jubilee trumpet + Lev 23:24 Feast of Trumpets

**APANTĒSIS G529**: "meet Lord in air" = civic escort pattern
Matt 25:6 virgins → bridegroom enters feast
Acts 28:15 brethren → escort Paul INTO Rome
1Th 4:17 → gathering escorts returning King to earth (not departure)

**"PEACE & SAFETY"**: 5:3 echoes Jer 6:14/8:11 "Peace, peace; when none"
G3639 ὄλεθρος = LXX Isa 47:11 (Babylon oracle) → FALL_OF_BABYLON vocabulary

**SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION + BIRTH_PAINS**: 5:3 same verse, opposite destinies
Destruction = inescapable for "them" || Birth pains = labor birthing new order
Believers excluded 5:4-5,9

**DAY/NIGHT/LIGHT/DARKNESS TETRAD**: 5:2-8 complete cluster
- Day of Lord = thief in NIGHT (5:2)
- Believers = children of LIGHT + DAY; not NIGHT + DARKNESS (5:5)
- SLEEP/drunk = NIGHT || sober/armor = DAY
- Perfect alignment: DAY=exposure, NIGHT=hiddenness, LIGHT=obedience, DARKNESS=concealment

**ISA 59:17 ARMOR TRANSFER**: 5:8 breastplate faith/love + helmet hope/salvation
YHWH wears righteousness/salvation armor for vengeance → Paul transfers to believers
Believers wear Judge's garb = participate in judgment era

**DAYS_OF_NOAH PATTERN** (unnamed but exact):
Normal life masking violation ("peace/safety") → sudden inescapable judgment → faithful preserved THROUGH not removed FROM
2Pet 3:5-10 links Noah-flood → day-of-Lord-as-thief → elements-fire

**OLIVET PARALLEL**:
Matt 24:30-31 (Son of Man + clouds + trumpet + gather) = 1Th 4:16-17
Matt 24:42-44 (thief + watch + unaware) = 1Th 5:2-6  
Matt 24:37-39 (Noah normalcy + sudden) = 1Th 5:3

**1COR 15:51-52 PARALLEL**: MOMENT G823 + TRUMPET + SLEEP + transformation = same event

## New Discoveries

**MISSING SYMBOLS** (queue for pipeline):
- TRUMPET: gathering/transformation/feast timing marker
- CLOUDS: divine presence/gathering location  
- WRATH G3709: covenant wrath ≠ thlipsis(distress/pressure) distinction
- ARMOR_OF_GOD: Isa 59:17 → 1Th 5:8 → Eph 6:11-17 transfer pattern
- APANTĒSIS G529: civic escort pattern (3× NT only)

**UPDATE NEEDED**:
RAPTURE_GATHERING + apantēsis analysis (toward earth direction)
SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION + Jer 6:14/8:11 false-peace connection
RETURN_OF_CHRIST + Isa 59:17 armor transfer

**QUEUE CONTEXTS**:
2Th 2:1-12 (man of lawlessness BEFORE gathering)
1Cor 15:50-58 (parallel trumpet/transformation)
2Pet 3:1-13 (day-as-thief expansion)
