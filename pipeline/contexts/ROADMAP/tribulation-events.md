Source: Mat 24:4-8 Critical Corrections §4 event ordering, cross-referenced with symbol studies and context files.

---

### EVENT 1: SEALING OF SERVANTS
**Symbolic Description:** Angel from the east (G395 anatole = sunrise = direction of God's approach) carries G4973 sphragis of the living God. Four angels restrain (G2902 krateo = hold fast) four winds at four corners of earth. 144,000 sealed on foreheads — 12×12×1000 = complete covenant community in full measure. Judah leads (Gen 49:10 scepter); Dan omitted (idolatry tradition).
**Preconditions:** Sixth seal shakes everything (Rev 6:12-17 — great seismos + sun/moon/stars dark + mountains/islands moved). Rev 7:1 "after these things" = sealing occurs in aftermath of cosmic disruption. The four winds/horsemen already exist and are dispatched (Zech 6:5 brass-mountain origin) but their effects are RESTRAINED until sealing completes.
**The Event:** Servants of God sealed on foreheads before judgment released (Rev 7:2-3). G891 achri = "UNTIL/till we have sealed" = temporal boundary — protection MUST precede destruction. Same pattern: Noah sealed in ark → flood; Israel marked with blood → destroyer passes; Ezek 9:4 tav on foreheads → executioners sent (Rev 7:2-3; Ezek 9:4).
**Postconditions:** Sealing ENABLES the four winds/horsemen to be released (Rev 7:3 "hurt not... TILL"). Without the sealing, birth pains cannot begin. This is the GATE for the entire Olivet Discourse sequence. Sequential, not concurrent: seal FIRST → winds released. Opens the door to Event 2 (Rev 7:1-3 → Rev 6:1-8 horsemen ride; contexts/Rev/7.001-008).
**Defining Scriptures:** Rev 7:1-8, Ezek 9:4, Rev 9:4, 2Tim 2:19, Eph 1:13, Eph 4:30

---

### EVENT 2: FOUR WINDS / HORSEMEN RELEASED — Birth Pains Begin
**Symbolic Description:** Four horsemen = four winds = four spirits (Zech 6:5 decode). White horse (deception/conquest at range — G5115 toxon = bow, distance weapon + delegated stephanos crown) → Red (war/sword/peace taken) → Black (famine/balances/scarcity pricing) → Pale/G5515 chloros (death tetrad: sword+hunger+death+beasts = Ezek 14:21). Colors encode function types. Mat 24:4-8 sequence maps 1:1 onto Rev 6:1-8 (contexts/Mat/24.004-008 §Phase 2).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 1 — Servants sealed (Rev 7:1-3). "Hurt not earth, sea, nor trees TILL we have sealed." Sealing complete → Lamb opens restraining seals on scroll → four living creatures command "Come!" → horsemen ride. Inverse seal operations: protection-seals applied ON servants BEFORE judgment-seals opened ON scroll (symbols/seal).
**The Event:** Deception (Mat 24:4-5 = Seal 1) → Wars/rumors (Mat 24:6 = Seal 2) → Famine (Mat 24:7a = Seal 3) → Pestilence+earthquakes (Mat 24:7b-c = Seal 4). Birth pains = early labor, NOT delivery. Jesus gives MECHANISM, not calendar — archē (G746) = generative cause. Deception produces fracture → war → famine/pestilence. Vocabulary triangle: Mat 24:6-7 ↔ Jer 51:46 ↔ 2Chr 15:5-6 = Babylon-collapse mechanism activating (contexts/Mat/24.004-008).
**Postconditions:** Birth pains create the conditions for testimony under persecution (Event 3). "The end is NOT YET" (Mat 24:6) — deflates premature expectation. Sword deferred to v9+ (personal violence after systemic shaking). Darkness deferred to v29 (climactic, not preliminary). COME_OUT deferred to v16. Birth pains = the beginning, not the end (symbols/four-horsemen).
**Defining Scriptures:** Rev 6:1-8, Mat 24:4-8, Zech 6:1-8, Ezek 14:21, 2Chr 15:5-6, Jer 51:46

---

### EVENT 3: TESTIMONY PERIOD Under Persecution
**Symbolic Description:** Two witnesses prophesy 1,260 days clothed in sackcloth (G4526 = goat-hair dark covering). They are the two olive trees + two lampstands (Zech 4:2-3,11-14) — both oil source and lamp bearers. Fire from their mouths = Jer 5:14, 23:29 word-as-fire. Power over waters to blood + smite earth with plagues = Exod 7-12 Moses-authority template. Sackcloth = visible testimony of judgment AND what Babylon's burning looks like from below — witnesses prophesy INSIDE the smoke (contexts/Rev/11.001-019; sackcloth study).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 2 — Birth pains active. Mat 24:9 "THEN shall they deliver you up" follows vv4-8 birth pains. Persecution begins AFTER systemic shaking reaches individuals (sword deferred from v7 to v9). 1,260 days = 42 months = Rev 12:6,14 = Rev 13:5 = Dan 12:7 — all concurrent: city trodden, witnesses prophesy, woman sheltered, beast reigns (contexts/Rev/11.001-019).
**The Event:** Gospel of the kingdom preached to all nations FOR A WITNESS (Mat 24:14 — G3142 marturion). Witnesses PROTECTED during testimony — beast CANNOT act until testimony G5055 teleo'd (Rev 11:7 "when they shall have FINISHED"). The witness period is structurally protected. Persecution accompanies but cannot terminate testimony before completion. Mat 24:9-13 = betrayal, hatred, false prophets, love grows cold, but "he that endureth to THE END shall be saved" (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §TELEO/TELOS).
**Postconditions:** Testimony completion (teleo) OPENS THE DOOR to beast-action (Event 4→5). Mat 24:14 "THEN shall the end come" = testimony finishing IS the trigger. Gospel-to-nations = not optional background activity but the structurally necessary precondition for what follows. "The end" (G5056 telos) = covenant fulfillment point, not mere chronological stop (symbols/seal §Mode C: Dan 12:4 sealed TILL time of end).
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:9-14, Rev 11:3-6, Zech 4:2-14, Jer 5:14, Exod 7-12

---

### EVENT 4: TESTIMONY COMPLETED
**Symbolic Description:** G5055 teleo (Rev 11:7 "hotan telesōsin tēn marturian") = same root as Jn 19:30 "tetelestai" (It is finished). Mat 24:14 marturion → G5056 telos. Rev 10:7 mystery teleo'd. 1Cor 15:24 telos = kingdom delivered. Same root, same event, four vantage points. The testimony IS the precondition; its completion IS the trigger (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §TELEO/TELOS).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 3 — Full testimony period completed. Witnesses FINISH (not cut short). The beast cannot act UNTIL they finish — witness period protected by sovereign design. Pattern: Jesus finishes testimony → dies → rises → receives authority. Witnesses repeat exactly: vv7→11→12→15 (contexts/Rev/11.001-019).
**The Event:** Mat 24:14 "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and THEN shall the end come." Rev 11:7 "when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them." Testimony completed = word withdrawn = Amos 8:11 famine of hearing the word begins. Rev 11:9-10 bodies lie 3.5 days while earth-dwellers celebrate (Dan 5 Babylon-feast-death pattern inverted — contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §Phase 2).
**Postconditions:** Testimony completion ENABLES beast-action (Event 5). The famine of the word begins (Amos 8:11-12). The sackcloth/smoke era transitions — witnesses silenced, but their blood-testimony continues (Rev 6:10 "how long?" under the altar). Opens the door for abomination installation (Mat 24:14→15 "THEN... WHEN ye shall see").
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:14, Rev 11:7, Rev 10:7, Jn 19:30, Amos 8:11-12, 1Cor 15:24

---

### EVENT 5: ABOMINATION INSTALLED
**Symbolic Description:** Man of sin (G444+G266) sits in temple of God (G3485 naos) showing himself that he IS God (2Th 2:4). Abomination of desolation (H8251+H8074 shiqquts+shamem) = counterfeit installed where God alone belongs — the replacement of covenant authority with human authority in the holy place. Beast ascends from pit (G12 abyssos = enforced containment, Rev 11:7) — influence restored after containment period. Rev 17:8 "was, and is not, and shall ascend" = counterfeit "I AM" (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §BEAST FROM ABYSS; contexts/Rev/17.001-018).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 4 — Testimony completed. Beast CANNOT act until witnesses finish (Rev 11:7 "when they shall have finished"). 2Th 2:3 falling away (G646 apostasia = covenant departure) comes FIRST, creating the vacancy counterfeit authority fills. 2Th 2:7 mystery of iniquity already working — visible from Mat 24:4-5 deception onward. Apostasia creates vacancy → man of sin fills it (contexts/Mat/24.004-008 §Phase 2 re: 2Th 2:7).
**Postconditions:** Abomination installation TRIGGERS the "come out" command (Event 6). Mat 24:15-16 "WHEN ye therefore shall see... THEN let them which be in Judaea FLEE." The abomination is the VISIBLE SIGN that extraction must happen immediately. Also triggers the 3.5-day death of witnesses (Rev 11:7-10) → resurrection (Rev 11:11) → ascent (Rev 11:12). The sign that Babylon's self-destruction is imminent.
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:15, 2Th 2:3-4, Rev 11:7, Dan 9:27, Dan 11:31, Dan 12:11

---

### EVENT 6: "COME OUT" — Extraction from Babylon
**Symbolic Description:** "Come out of her MY PEOPLE" (Rev 18:4) = Jer 51:6,45 verbatim. Extraction = covenant separation from condemned system. Cherem principle: touching what God declared cherem MAKES YOU cherem (Josh 6:18 → 7:1,12; Deut 7:26). "Come out" is not preference — it is survival protocol. Cherem is CONTAGIOUS: remaining in the banned system transfers the ban onto you (contexts/Rev/18.001-024 §Phase 2 ISA 34).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 5 — Abomination visible. Mat 24:15-16 "when ye see... flee." The abomination is the diagnostic sign triggering extraction. Gen 19:22 Lot principle: "I CANNOT do anything till thou be come thither" = judgment structurally LOCKED behind extraction. God's people must be out before fire falls (contexts/Rev/18.001-024 §Critical Corrections).
**The Event:** Rev 18:4 "come out of her, my people, that ye be not PARTAKERS of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Jer 51:6 "Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul." Jer 51:45 "My people, go ye out of the midst of her." Extraction = physical/economic/spiritual separation from the Babylon system before its self-consumption. Josh 6:22-24 Rahab extracted by scarlet cord BEFORE fire; Rev 11:12 witnesses ascend in cloud BEFORE earthquake-judgment (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §Round 2 JERICHO).
**Postconditions:** Extraction ENABLES destruction (Event 7). Once God's people are clear, the self-consumption mechanism activates. Rev 18:4→18:8 "burned with fire." The extraction IS the signal that self-destruction is imminent. Parallels: Noah enters ark → flood; Lot exits Sodom → fire; Rahab extracted → Jericho burns (symbols/fall-of-babylon §ORDERING).
**Defining Scriptures:** Rev 18:4, Jer 51:6, Jer 51:45, Gen 19:22, Josh 6:22-24, Deut 7:26

---

### EVENT 7: TEN HORNS DESTROY BABYLON THE GREAT — Self-Consuming Fire
**Symbolic Description:** Ten horns = kings/political powers WITHIN the beast-system (Rev 17:12). Crown migration pattern: Dragon (Rev 12:3 crowns on heads) → Beast (Rev 13:1 crowns on horns) = authority decentralized to projections. Horns receive authority "one hour WITH the beast" — delegated, temporary, dependent. Then these SAME horns HATE the harlot, make her desolate, eat her flesh, burn her with fire (Rev 17:16). Ezek 28:18 "fire FROM THE MIDST of thee." Isa 9:18-19 "wickedness burneth as the fire... people as the fuel." Self-consuming, not externally conquered (contexts/Rev/17.001-018; symbols/fall-of-babylon §WHO DESTROYS).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 6 — God's people extracted. Judgment structurally locked behind extraction (Gen 19:22). Rev 17:17 "GOD hath put in their hearts to fulfil His will" = the self-destruction is DIVINELY ORCHESTRATED, triggered when God's purpose requires it. Isa 13:17 Medes "regard not silver, delight not in gold" = executioners immune to Babylon's currency — they destroy by divine impulse, not profit (contexts/Rev/18.001-024 §Round 2 TEN HORNS).
**The Event:** Rev 17:16-17 ten horns hate harlot → make desolate → eat flesh → burn with fire → God put it in their hearts. Rev 18:8 "in ONE DAY, death and mourning and famine; and she shall be UTTERLY BURNED with fire." Three witnesses name "one hour" (Rev 18:10,17,19) = sudden-destruction principle: gap between perceived security and actual judgment is infinitesimal. Rev 18:7 "I sit a queen" = 1Th 5:3 "peace and safety" = Isa 47:8 "I am, and none else" → sudden destruction (contexts/Rev/18.001-024).
**Postconditions:** Babylon burning produces SMOKE (Rev 18:9,18; 19:3) which = sackcloth covering the sun (Rev 6:12) = the darkening of Event 8. Rev 18:21 millstone into sea = commercial kingdom ground to nothing. Sevenfold "no more" (Rev 18:22-23): music, craft, millstone, lamp, bridegroom/bride voice = total withdrawal of every covenant-function from the system. Opens cosmic darkening (Event 8) and vindicates the blood of prophets+saints (Rev 18:24; contexts/Rev/18.001-024 §V22-23).
**Defining Scriptures:** Rev 17:16-17, Rev 18:8-19, Ezek 28:18, Isa 9:18-19, Isa 47:8-11, Jer 51:25

---

### EVENT 8: COSMIC DARKENING — Babylon's Authority Collapses
**Symbolic Description:** Sun darkened + moon not giving light + stars falling + powers of heavens shaken (Mat 24:29). Smoke of Babylon's burning (Rev 18:9,18; 19:3) = sackcloth that covers the sun (Rev 6:12 "sun became black as sackcloth of hair"). FIRE→SMOKE→DARKNESS chain: fire produces smoke; smoke darkens authority structure. Isa 13:10 Babylon oracle: "sun darkened in going forth, moon not cause her light to shine." Same vocabulary in Joel 3:15-16: sun/moon dark + heavens/earth shake = old authorities extinguished at the exact moment true authority speaks (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §Phase 2 JOEL 3).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 7 — Babylon burning. The smoke of the burning IS the mechanism of the darkening. Rev 9:2 smoke from abyss darkens sun (mechanism). Sackcloth = smoke's appearance from below. The darkening is not a separate astronomical event — it is the RESULT of Babylon's system-collapse. Authority-structures (sun/moon/stars = ruling powers) go dark because their source (Babylon) is on fire (symbols/fall-of-babylon §7TH TRUMPET).
**The Event:** Mat 24:29 "IMMEDIATELY AFTER the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken." Isa 13:10-13 Babylon oracle provides the source vocabulary. Rev 6:12-14 sixth seal parallels. The system's authority-lights go out — political, economic, religious, cultural authority-structures that derived their power from Babylon collapse when she burns.
**Postconditions:** Darkening ENABLES the Son of Man's appearance (Event 9). Mat 24:30 "AND THEN shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven." The Son of Man appears THROUGH the smoke/cloud. The smoke of Babylon's burning = the cloud of Christ's appearing. The darkening of the counterfeit lights makes the true Light visible. Rev 19:3 "her smoke rose up forever" is the permanent backdrop against which the Kingdom is visible.
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:29, Isa 13:10-13, Rev 6:12-14, Joel 3:15-16, Amos 8:9, Rev 18:9

---

### EVENT 9: SON OF MAN APPEARS Through Smoke/Cloud
**Symbolic Description:** Mat 24:30 "sign of the Son of man in heaven... coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory." Dan 7:13 "one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days." The smoke of Babylon's burning (Rev 19:3) = the cloud through which the King appears. The cloud is not a vehicle — it is the smoke of judgment through which glory becomes visible. Ezek 43:2 "glory of God came from the way of the east" (same direction as sealing angel, Rev 7:2). Mat 24:27 "lightning comes out of the east" = same approach-direction.
**Preconditions:** EVENT 8 — Cosmic darkening. "IMMEDIATELY AFTER the tribulation... THEN shall appear" (Mat 24:29-30). The old authority-lights must go dark before the true light appears. Counterfeit authority (sun/moon/stars as Babylon's system) collapses → true authority (Son of Man) becomes visible through the smoke. Dan 7:13-14 "came to the Ancient of days" = presented before the throne to RECEIVE dominion — this is the approach, not the departure (symbols/fall-of-babylon).
**The Event:** Mat 24:30 all tribes of earth mourn (Zech 12:10-12 pattern — recognition + grief). They SEE the Son of Man coming. "With power and great glory" = the authority Babylon claimed now visibly residing in its true owner. Dan 7:14 "there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve him." The appearing IS the claim — visible manifestation of rightful authority replacing the collapsed counterfeit.
**Postconditions:** Son of Man's appearing ENABLES the trumpet (Event 10). Mat 24:30-31 "THEN... AND he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet." The appearing triggers the coronation-signal. Rev 11:15 "kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ" = the kingdom transfer that the appearing initiates.
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:30, Dan 7:13-14, Zech 12:10, Rev 1:7, Rev 19:11-16

---

### EVENT 10: GREAT TRUMPET — Kingdom Transfer
**Symbolic Description:** H7782 shophar = authoritative signal of God's sovereign action initiating irreversible transition between ages. The "last trump" (G2078 eschatos, 1Cor 15:52) = final in the 7-trumpet sequence = 7th trumpet of Rev 11:15. Five traditions converge at this trumpet: Jubilee (Lev 25:9 — debts cancelled, slaves freed, land returned), Feast of Trumpets (Lev 23:24 — opens final feast sequence), Jericho (Josh 6:20 — 7th circuit, walls fall, city taken), coronation (1Ki 1:34,39), ingathering (Isa 27:13). The trumpet IS the hinge-point between the old order and the new (symbols/trumpet).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 9 — Son of Man visible. Mat 24:31 "he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet." The trumpet follows the appearing. Rev 8:1 silence in heaven (= Josh 6:10 silence command) precedes trumpet-judgments; Rev 11:15 7th trumpet follows the full sequence. Sinai template: God descends + trumpet exceeding loud (Exo 19:16-19) = 1Th 4:16 "Lord himself shall descend... with the trump of God." Heb 12:19 recalls this trumpet explicitly (symbols/trumpet §SINAI TEMPLATE).
**The Event:** Rev 11:15 "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever." Simultaneously: kingdom transfers (v15) + dead judged (v18) + saints rewarded (v18) + destroyers destroyed (v18 — G1311 diaphtheiro ×2 = Jer 51:25 "destroying mountain") + ark/covenant revealed (v19) + earthquake (v19). 1Cor 15:52 "at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed." Jericho at cosmic scale: moon-city (H3405 from H3394 yareach) falls at the 7th trumpet (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §Round 2 TRUMPET+JERICHO).
**Postconditions:** Kingdom transfer ENABLES the gathering (Event 11). Mat 24:31 trumpet → angels gather elect. The trumpet initiates what follows; the transition is irreversible. Jubilee enacted: all debts of the old system cancelled, all slaves freed, all land (kingdom) returned to its rightful owner. Bookend: Sinai establishment → 7th trumpet consummation (contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §ARK REVEALED).
**Defining Scriptures:** Rev 11:15-19, 1Cor 15:52, 1Th 4:16, Mat 24:31, Isa 27:13, Lev 25:9-10, Josh 6:20

---

### EVENT 11: GATHERING OF ELECT From Four Winds
**Symbolic Description:** G1997 episunagōgē (2Th 2:1) = gathering-upon-together. G726 harpazō (1Th 4:17) = forceful seizure/transfer. G529 apantēsis (1Th 4:17) = technical civic-escort term: citizens go OUT to meet arriving dignitary, then escort Him BACK IN to His destination. Acts 28:15 brethren went out to meet Paul → escorted him INTO Rome, not away. Mat 25:6 virgins go out to meet bridegroom → he enters the feast. The gathering is an escort TOWARD earth (the King's destination), not departure FROM it (symbols/rapture-gathering §APANTESIS).
**Preconditions:** EVENT 10 — Great trumpet sounded. Mat 24:31 "with a great sound of a trumpet... shall GATHER together his elect." 1Th 4:16 "trump of God" → dead rise → living caught up. 2Th 2:1 episunagōgē comes AFTER man-of-sin revealed (2Th 2:1-3). The sealing (Event 1) was the PREREQUISITE; the gathering is the CULMINATION. Servants marked so they survive what comes between sealing and ingathering (symbols/rapture-gathering §SEALING PRECONDITION).
**The Event:** Mat 24:31 "he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." 1Th 4:16-17 "the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air." Isa 27:13 "the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem." H622 asaph links INGATHERING FEAST (Sukkot/7th month) to harvest-completion to dwelling with God. The gathering IS the Feast of Ingathering fulfilled (symbols/rapture-gathering §TRIPLE-LANGUAGE).
**Postconditions:** The covenant community is fully assembled before the King. Birth-pains arc complete: Mat 24:8 (beginning of labor) → Rev 11:15 (delivery) = Isa 66:7-9 "nation born in one day." Scattered Israel regathered (Deu 30:3-4 covenant restoration after curse). SCATTER reversed → GATHER. Sukkot = 7th month = completion = final harvest = dwelling with God. The gathering inaugurates the age to come: the King is present, the people are assembled, the kingdom has transferred, the old system is smoke (symbols/rapture-gathering; contexts/Rev/11.001-019 §FULFILLMENT AUDIT).
**Defining Scriptures:** Mat 24:31, 1Th 4:16-17, 2Th 2:1, Isa 27:13, Isa 11:12, Deu 30:3-4, 1Cor 15:52

## Sequence Summary

```
EVENT 1: Sealing ─────────► GATE (Rev 7:1-8)
    │
EVENT 2: Horsemen Released ► Birth pains begin (Rev 6:1-8 = Mat 24:4-8)
    │
EVENT 3: Testimony Period ─► 1,260 days in sackcloth (Mat 24:9-14 = Rev 11:3-6)
    │
EVENT 4: Testimony Complete ► "then the end" / teleo (Mat 24:14 = Rev 11:7)
    │
EVENT 5: Abomination ──────► Beast acts (Mat 24:15 = 2Th 2:3-4)
    │
EVENT 6: "Come Out" ───────► Extraction (Rev 18:4 = Jer 51:6,45)
    │
EVENT 7: Ten Horns Destroy ► Self-consuming fire (Rev 17:16-17)
    │
EVENT 8: Cosmic Darkening ─► Authority collapses (Mat 24:29 = Isa 13:10)
    │
EVENT 9: Son of Man Appears ► Through smoke/cloud (Mat 24:30 = Dan 7:13)
    │
EVENT 10: Great Trumpet ───► Kingdom transfer (Rev 11:15 = 1Cor 15:52)
    │
EVENT 11: Gathering ───────► Elect assembled (Mat 24:31 = 1Th 4:16-17)
```

**Key structural principle:** Each event is structurally LOCKED behind its predecessor. The sealing must complete before horsemen ride. Testimony must finish before the beast acts. Extraction must occur before Babylon burns. The darkening results from the burning. The Son of Man appears through the smoke. The trumpet follows the appearing. The gathering follows the trumpet. No event can be moved without breaking the causal chain Scripture establishes.
