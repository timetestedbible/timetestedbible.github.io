## Tribulation Events — Revised Sequence

Rev 2 corrections: (1) Man-child vanishing added before birth pains per Isa 66:7. (2) Two 1,260-day periods, not one. (3) Revelation seals/trumpets/bowls = parallel perspectives, not sequential series. (4) Kingdom declared at Babylon's fall (7th trumpet = 7th bowl = convergence). (5) Jubilee vocabulary governs Jer 50-51 = fall of Babylon IS the cosmic Jubilee. (6) Mat 24 = inclusio (ring), not chronological timeline.

**STRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES:**
- Revelation's three series (seals, trumpets, bowls) are THREE PERSPECTIVES on the same period: seals = heaven's view, trumpets = witness perspective, bowls = judgment execution. The 7th of each converges on ONE event: Babylon falls = kingdom transfers = "it is done."
- Mat 24 is an inclusio: A (vanishing question, v3) → B (aftermath, vv4-28) → B' (climax, vv29-31) → A' (vanishing revisited, vv32-51). The discourse opens and closes with the main event (sudden separation during normalcy); the middle describes what follows.
- Isa 66:7-8 governs the structure: man child delivered BEFORE pain (v7); children born THROUGH pain (v8). Two deliveries, not one.
- Rev 12 presents three groups from one mother: man child (caught up, v5), woman (flees, v6), remnant of her seed (faces dragon, v17).

---

### EVENT 0: MAN CHILD DELIVERED — Before Pain

**Isa 66:7:** "Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain (H2256 chebel) came, she was delivered (H4422 malat) of a man child." H4422 malat = Lot's escape word (Gen 19:17,19,20,22 ×4). Man-child study: covenant nation/overcomers, not Jesus individually (Isa 66:8 "nation" confirms corporate). Rev 12:5: man child caught up (G726 harpazo = 1Th 4:17 same word) to God's throne BEFORE dragon acts.

**Five witnesses to the vanishing:** (1) Isa 66:7 malat = escape before pain. (2) Rev 12:5 harpazo = caught up to throne. (3) Dan 9:26 patched: Messiah karath (cuts covenant) and H369 ayin (vanishes — Enoch's word, Gen 5:24). (4) 2Th 2:7 restrainer "taken out of the way." (5) Gen 5:24 Enoch "was not (H369), for God took him" — before the flood.

**Preconditions:** Normalcy. "Eating, drinking, marrying" (Mat 24:38). "Peace and safety" (1Th 5:3). No cosmic signs. No trumpet. No warning. Thief in the night. Occurs during the A/A' frame of Mat 24's inclusio (vv37-41 "one taken, one left" using G3880 paralambano = receive alongside, Jn 14:3 same word).

**Postconditions:** Restraint released. Righteous presence was restraining judgment (Gen 18:23-32 Sodom principle; Gen 19:22 "I cannot do anything till thou be come thither"; Rev 7:1-3 winds held "till"). Removal = wicked revealed by absence (2Th 2:8 G601 apokalypto = uncovering). Four winds/horsemen can now ride. Birth pains begin.

---

### EVENT 1: SEALING OF SERVANTS

**Rev 7:1-8:** 144,000 sealed on foreheads = 12×12×1,000 = complete covenant witness community. Connection: 72 sent two by two (Lk 10:1) = 144 witnesses × 1,000 = full-scale commission. Two witnesses of Rev 11:3 = representative pair of this commission.

**Preconditions:** Man child vanished (Event 0). Four winds already dispatched but restrained (Zech 6:5 brass-mountain origin). Rev 7:3 G891 achri = "TILL we have sealed" = temporal boundary.

**Postconditions:** Sealing ENABLES the four winds/horsemen to be released. Sequential: seal FIRST → winds released.

---

### EVENT 2: FOUR WINDS / HORSEMEN RELEASED — Birth Pains Begin

**Rev 6:1-8 = Mat 24:4-8 = Zech 6:1-8.** White (deception) → Red (war) → Black (famine) → Pale (death tetrad). = Babylon-collapse mechanism (vocabulary triangle: Mat 24:6-7 ↔ Jer 51:46 ↔ 2Chr 15:6). Note: Mat 24:4-8 describes the B section (aftermath of vanishing), not the chronological beginning.

**Preconditions:** Event 1 — Servants sealed.

**Postconditions:** Birth pains create conditions for testimony under persecution. "The end is NOT YET" (Mat 24:6).

---

### FIRST 1,260 DAYS: TESTIMONY PERIOD

### EVENT 3: TESTIMONY Under Persecution

**Rev 11:3:** Two witnesses prophesy 1,260 days in sackcloth. = Mat 24:9-14 gospel preached for a witness. Witnesses PROTECTED — beast CANNOT act until testimony G5055 teleo'd (Rev 11:7). Mat 24:14 "THEN shall the end come" = testimony finishing IS the trigger.

**Preconditions:** Event 2 — Birth pains active. Persecution begins after systemic shaking reaches individuals.

**Postconditions:** Testimony completion opens door to beast-action. Apostasia (G646 = covenant departure, 2Th 2:3) occurs WITHIN this period, creating vacancy counterfeit fills.

---

### MIDPOINT — THE HINGE

### EVENT 4: TESTIMONY COMPLETED / BEAST ACTS

**Rev 11:7:** "When they shall have FINISHED (teleo) their testimony, the beast... shall overcome them, and kill them." Mat 24:14 → 15: "THEN the end... WHEN ye see the abomination."

**Three things happen at the midpoint:**
(a) Witnesses killed — bodies lie 3.5 "days" = 3.5 prophetic years (Ezek 4:6 day-year principle) = the second half.
(b) Abomination installed — man of sin sits in naos (2Th 2:3-4). Beast ascends from abyss (Rev 11:7).
(c) Woman (Israel) flees — "WHEN ye see... THEN flee to the mountains" (Mat 24:15-16). Rev 12:6: woman flees to wilderness 1,260 days. Israel repents under judgment and flees.

**"Come Out" extraction:** Rev 18:4 = Jer 51:6,45. Remaining faithful exit Babylon. Gen 19:22 principle: "I cannot do anything till thou be come thither." No Jews remain in the system — all have fled.

---

### SECOND 1,260 DAYS: WOMAN IN WILDERNESS / BEAST AUTHORITY

### EVENT 5: WOMAN SHELTERED, BEAST REIGNS

**Rev 12:6,14:** Woman nourished in wilderness 1,260 days / time+times+half time. **Rev 13:5:** Beast exercises authority 42 months. **Rev 11:2:** Holy city trodden 42 months. All = the second half.

**Dragon's flood:** Rev 12:15 serpent spews G4215 potamos (river/flood) = army of nations pursuing the woman. = Dan 9:26 "end with a H7858 sheteph (flood)" — same concept: overwhelming military force. Water = nations (Rev 17:15). **Rev 12:16:** Earth opens mouth, swallows flood = EARTHQUAKE destroys pursuing army. May = Rev 11:13 earthquake (same hour witnesses rise).

**Rev 12:17:** Dragon gives up pursuing woman → turns to make war with "remnant of her seed, which keep commandments of God and have testimony of Jesus." = Rev 13:7 beast makes war with saints.

**Witnesses "dead":** The 3.5 "days" (= 3.5 years) of witnesses' bodies lying in the street = the second half. Word withdrawn (Amos 8:11 famine of hearing). Earth-dwellers celebrate the silence (Rev 11:10). The testimony IS dead during this period.

---

### EVENT 6: BABYLON FALLS / KINGDOM DECLARED — One Convergent Event

**7th trumpet = 7th bowl = 7th seal = Jubilee trumpet = ONE EVENT.**

Rev 11:15: "Kingdoms of this world become kingdoms of our Lord." Rev 16:17-19: "It is done" + greatest earthquake + "great Babylon came in remembrance." Rev 8:1,5: silence + fire cast to earth. Three 7th-events, one pattern: TRANSFER OF SOVEREIGNTY.

**The fall of Babylon IS the cosmic Jubilee.** Jubilee vocabulary saturates Jer 50-51:
- Trumpet/shout (50:15, 51:27) = Lev 25:9
- Redeemer H1350 gaal (50:34) = Lev 25:25,48-49
- Captives freed (50:33-34) = Lev 25:41,54
- Debts/sins cancelled (50:20 "iniquity NOT FOUND") = Lev 25:28
- Land returned (50:19 "bring Israel to his habitation") = Lev 25:13
- Rest for the land (50:34 H7280 raga) = Lev 25:4-5
- Return + perpetual covenant (50:4-5) = Lev 25:10

The Jubilee trumpet INITIATES — blown at the START (Lev 25:9 Day of Atonement). The kingdom is declared at the taking of Babylon, not after cleanup. Liberty proclaimed. Debts cancelled. Slaves freed. Land returned.

**Simultaneously at this event:** Kingdom transfers (Rev 11:15) + Babylon remembered/judged (Rev 16:19) + dead judged (Rev 11:18) + saints rewarded (Rev 11:18) + destroyers destroyed (Rev 11:18) + ark revealed (Rev 11:19) + terminal earthquake (Rev 16:18-20) + witnesses rise from 3.5-day death (Rev 11:11-12) + "It is done" (Rev 16:17).

**Mechanism:** Ten horns devour harlot (Rev 17:16-17) = self-consuming fire (Ezek 28:18). FIRE → SMOKE → DARKNESS: fire produces smoke; smoke darkens authority (Isa 13:10 Babylon oracle = source text for Mat 24:29). Son of Man appears THROUGH the smoke/cloud (Mat 24:30 = Dan 7:13).

---

### EVENT 7: GATHERING OF REMAINING ELECT

**Mat 24:31:** Angels gather elect from four winds with great trumpet. = 1Th 4:16-17 dead rise + living caught up. = Isa 27:13 great trumpet + worship at Jerusalem.

**G529 apantesis** = civic escort TOWARD earth. Citizens go out to meet arriving King, escort Him to His destination. Acts 28:15: brethren met Paul → escorted INTO Rome. Gathering converges on the literal Mountain — Mount Zion (Isa 27:13, Zech 14:4, Mic 4:1-2).

**= Isa 66:8** "her children" born through travail. Nation born in a day. The second delivery — through the pain, at the trumpet.

**= G1996 episunago** (Mat 24:31) — distinct from G3880 paralambano (Mat 24:40-41). Different word, different setting, different event. Episunago = post-trumpet, post-cosmic-signs. Paralambano = normalcy-era, pre-pain.

```

**Key structural change from Rev 1:** The man-child vanishing (Event 0) PRECEDES the birth pains, based on Isa 66:7, the wrath distinction (thlipsis ≠ orgé, saints not appointed to orgé), the Sodom principle (Gen 18-19), and the five witnesses to the vanishing (Isa 66:7, Rev 12:5, Dan 9:26 patched, 2Th 2:7, Gen 5:24). Mat 24's inclusio structure frames the vanishing (A/A') around the aftermath (B/B'). Two gatherings distinguished by vocabulary: paralambano (normalcy-era receiving) vs episunago (post-trumpet assembly).

**Timeline:** 70 jubilees from Jordan crossing (1406 BC + 3430 = ~2024 AD). Abraham's covenant (~1876 BC) + 3900 = ~2025 AD (kingdom declared) + 1000 (millennium) = 4900 = 70×70 (Dan 9:24 "seventy seventy"). Kingdom declared at START — Jubilee trumpet initiates.
