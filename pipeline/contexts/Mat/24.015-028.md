STRUCTURE: TRIGGER → FLIGHT → GREAT DISTRESS(thlipsis) → DECEPTION → RETURN → PROVERB. Five-movement sequence climactic between birth-pains + cosmic consummation.

ABOMINATION-OF-DESOLATION TRIGGER:
v15: "stand in holy place" (G40+G5117) activates three-part pattern: true worship removed → counterfeit installed → covenant place emptied
Mark 13:14 MASCULINE participle (hestekota) = abomination personified as HE
Luke 21:20 = "Jerusalem compassed with armies" = Roman eagles/Caesar's image = military mechanism

REV 11 ORDERING - BEAST EMERGES FROM SMOKE:
Rev 9:1-2: abyss opens → smoke rises → sun darkened → Rev 9:3: agents from smoke
Rev 11:7: beast ascendeth from abyss = same smoke-source
Mat 24:14→15 CAUSAL: gospel completion triggers abomination
Beast cannot act UNTIL testimony complete (Rev 11:7a-b)

"WHOSO READETH" (v15):
G3539 noeo = Jesus breaks fourth wall, addresses Daniel readers beyond 70 AD
Same principle Dan 12:10: wise shall understand

"FLEE TO MOUNTAINS" = FLEE TO KINGDOMS:
MOUNTAIN = KINGDOM (Dan 2:35, Rev 17:9) → plural "mountains" = nations
Luke 21:24: "led captive into ALL NATIONS"
Acts 8:1,4: scattered → preaching → Acts 11:19: to Phoenicia, Cyprus, Antioch
Flight mechanism FULFILLS v14: persecution → flight to kingdoms → gospel to all nations → end
COME OUT pattern: Lot/mountain (Gen 19:17) → Israel/Egypt → Christians/Jerusalem → Rev 18:4/Babylon

REV 12:6,14 CONNECTION:
Woman given eagle wings → wilderness 1,260 days = time/times/half time ≈ Dan 12:11 "1,290 days"
Flight FROM abomination lasts ≈ same duration AS abomination
Eagle wings = Ex 19:4 covenant transport

"NOT ON SABBATH" (v20):
Uniquely Matthean → Torah-observant audience assumed at fulfillment
Creates tension with purely-70-AD reading

"GREAT DISTRESS" (v21, G2347 thlipsis megalē — pressure/affliction, NOT a technical term):
Echoes Dan 12:1 + Jer 30:7 verbatim = three superlative claims
Jer 30:7b: "saved OUT OF it" not FROM it = G5278 hupomeno (remain under)
70 AD severe but superlative presses toward terminal fulfillment

ELECT POSITION (G1588 eklektos):
v22: present during distress (days shortened FOR elect)
v24: targets of deception DURING distress  
v31: gathered AFTER distress → post-distress sequence

FALSE CHRISTS + SIGNS (vv23-26):
v24: G4592 semeion + G5059 teras = supernatural counterfeiting
|| 2 Thess 2:9 lawless one with signs/lying wonders
Deception peaks with supernatural escalation

"SECRET CHAMBERS" vs "LIGHTNING" (vv26-27):
v26: desert (G2048) + secret chambers (G5009) = hidden Christ-claims
v27 CONTRAST: lightning (G796) east (G395) → west (G1424) = total visibility
Parousia (G3952) = universal + instantaneous + unmistakable + from heaven
Any pointed-out "Christ" = false by definition

G4430 PTOMA (v28):
"Carcass" = ptōma from G4098 piptō = fallen thing, not just corpse
Eagles (G105) gather where thing has FALLEN
Luke 17:37: don't need map → judgment messengers know fall location
Levels: 70 AD (Roman eagles/Jerusalem) + Rev 18:2 (Babylon FALLEN) + proverbial

LUKE 17:32 CONNECTION:
"Remember Lot's wife" → Gen 19:26 looked back, became salt
Total commitment to forward motion from falling system
Confirms Mat 24 flight → Gen 19 Sodom extraction → Rev 11:8 Babylon/Sodom parallel

FULFILLMENT AUDIT:
vv15-22: 70 AD strongest fit (trigger→flight→distress→shortening)
vv23-27: absent 70 AD (supernatural deception, visible parousia)
Confirms dual-horizon: near-historical pattern → eschatological consummation

SYMBOL INTEGRATION:
RAPTURE_GATHERING: absent vv15-28, elect IN distress (v22,24), gathering v31 post-distress
RETURN_OF_CHRIST: v27 defines parousia = lightning, universal, unmistakable
FALL_OF_BABYLON: flee = Jer 51:6/Rev 18:4, ptoma-gathering = fallen system
SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION: distress(thlipsis) = covenant judgment pressure, shortened for mercy
DAYS_OF_NOAH: Luke 17:26-37 parallel, Lot's wife = attachment to condemned world
MISSING: TRUMPET (v31), GATHERING (v31), DARKNESS (v29), SLEEP (urgency peaks), NAME (false claims vs true authority at parousia)
