## Context Integration

**SUBJECT:** Jesus's sequential roadmap: deception → tribulation signs → visible return → gathering
**spkr:** Jesus on Mt Olives **ctx:** disciples' question about timing/signs of coming + end of age

### Symbol Convergence (11/15 explicit in vv4-31):

**DECEIVE inclusio:** vv4-5,11,23-26 planao frames discourse → false christs/prophets bracket pre-return period
**BIRTH_PAINS sequence:** v8 explicit label for vv6-7 tetrad
**WARS_AND_RUMORS:** v6 polemos + nation≠nation v7 = 2Chr15:6 LXX verbatim
**NATION_AGAINST_NATION:** ethnos pattern → God troubles them (2Chr15:5-6 template)
**FAMINE + EARTHQUAKE:** v7 literal signs → v29 cosmic scale shift
**THE_END:** v6 "not yet" + v13 endurance goal + v14 gospel completion trigger
**RETURN_OF_CHRIST:** v27 lightning (instant/visible) + v30 clouds/power (Dan7:13)
**RAPTURE_GATHERING:** v31 angels episunago elect four winds → 2Th2:1 episunagoge
**SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION:** vv17-19 urgency (don't return for cloak) → immediate flight

### Structural Patterns:

**7-movement sequence:** DECEIVE warning → BIRTH_PAINS signs → persecution/gospel → abomination/flee → great tribulation + false signs → lightning return → cosmic signs + gathering

**Template overlays:**
- vv6-8 = Eze14:21 tetrad compressed
- v15 = Dan9:27/11:31/12:11 abomination markers
- vv29-30 = Isa13:10 (Babylon judgment) + Dan7:13 convergence
- v31 = Isa27:13 ingathering trumpet + Isa11:12 four winds

**Symbol chains:** DECEIVE → WARS → NATION/NATION → FAMINE → EARTHQUAKE → BIRTH_PAINS → THE_END → ABOMINATION → TRIBULATION → LIGHTNING → COSMIC_SIGNS → GATHERING (unbroken sequence)

**Role shifts:** EARTHQUAKE v7 literal seismic → v29 cosmic shaking (Hag2:6). THE_END "not yet" v6 → mission-complete v14

### Missing Elements (deferred to ch25 parables):
MARRIAGE/VIRGIN/OIL absent until vv37-39,ch25 → separation symbols follow roadmap completion
BABYLON unnamed but Isa13:10 vocabulary applied v29 → judgment template without identifier
FIRE absent despite NOAH context → 2Pet3:7 water→fire deferred

### Language Connections:
H2256 chebel (cord+pain) → v8 odin birth-pains = covenant cord tightening
G1996 episunago v31 = G1997 episunagoge 2Th2:1 (same gathering event)
"Great trumpet" v31 = Isa27:13 + Lev25:9 Jubilee ingathering marker

### Critical Convergence:
**Rev6:12-17 seals reproduce vv6-8,29 exactly:** wars→famine→death→earthquake→sun/moon/stars→tribes mourn
**This is the NEXUS passage generating most symbol patterns in NT eschatology**

**CONFIDENCE: HIGH** — 11+ loaded symbols converge; structural parallels multiple; Rev6 sequence confirms template status
