NEXUS: All seven roadmap events in three verses - no other passage concentrates all simultaneously
V29: [FALL_OF_BABYLON] + [EARTHQUAKE] → Isa 13:10 vocabulary + powers shaken (Hag 2:6)
V30: [RETURN_OF_CHRIST] → Son of Man in clouds (Dan 7:13) + mourning (Zech 12:10)
V31: [RAPTURE_GATHERING] → trumpet + four winds + elect gathered (Isa 27:13, 1Th 4:16-17)
Implicit: [SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION] = distress(thlipsis) just ended; [DAYS_OF_NOAH] = tribes mourn = those who rejected; [THIRD_DAY] = deliverance arrives; [DAY_AS_1000_YEARS] = appointed time fulfilled

"Immediately after" (G2112 eutheos) = straight, directly, at once + meta tēn thlipsin = after the distress/pressure of those days → cosmic signs begin with no gap
[DARKNESS]: Sun/moon/stars darkened quotes Isa 13:10 verbatim - "THE BURDEN OF BABYLON" (Isa 13:1)
Isa 13 context: v6 "day of LORD at hand, as destruction from Almighty" = [SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION]; v13 "I will shake heavens" = [EARTHQUAKE]
Joel 2:31 "sun to darkness, moon to blood, BEFORE the great + terrible day of LORD" → Acts 2:20 = entire church age as "before that day"
[EARTHQUAKE]: "Powers of heavens shaken" (G4531 saleuo) → Hag 2:6 + Heb 12:26-27 = removing shakeable authority-structures
Heb 12:28 "receiving kingdom which cannot be moved" = Dan 2:44 "kingdom which shall never be destroyed"

Literal vs symbolic: Both - OT prophets used identical language for historical events (Babylon 539 BC, Egypt fall)
Joel 2:31 + Acts 2:20 treat as FUTURE; Heb 12:26-27 treats final shaking as once-for-all
Pattern: Each historical instance = partial symbolic fulfillment; final instance may be literal + symbolic

"Sign of Son of Man in heaven" (v30): G4592 semeion - Son of Man's visible appearing ON clouds IS the sign
Dan 7:13-14 movement TOWARD God (enthronement in heaven) becomes VISIBLE on earth
"All tribes of earth mourn" = Zech 12:10-12 + Rev 1:7: G2875 kopto = beat breast
Zech 12:10 "look upon me whom they pierced" + "spirit of grace + supplications" = repentance not mere terror

[RAPTURE_GATHERING]: Trumpet + gathering = five-tradition convergence:
(1) 1Th 4:16 "trump of God" + dead rise + caught up; (2) 1Cor 15:52 "last trump" + dead raised; (3) Isa 27:13 "great trumpet" + gathered from Assyria/Egypt; (4) Lev 25:9 Jubilee trumpet; (5) Lev 23:24 Feast of Trumpets
G1996 episunago = G1997 episunagoge (2Th 2:1 "our GATHERING TOGETHER unto him")
2Th 2:1-3: apostasy + man-of-sin PRECEDE this gathering

[FOUR_WINDS]: Reversal of scattering - Deut 28:64 curse scattered → covenant curse reversed
Ezek 37:9 "Come from four winds, O breath" = dry bones re-gathered, resurrected
Mark 13:27 "from uttermost part of EARTH to uttermost part of HEAVEN" = living (earth) + dead (heaven)
= 1Th 4:16-17: dead rise FIRST, then living caught up TOGETHER

70 AD fulfillment fails: ZERO elements of vv29-31 have documented first-century fulfillment
Vv4-28 have strong 30-70 AD parallels; vv29-31 have NONE
Demands dual-horizon hermeneutic: historical pattern (vv4-28) → eschatological consummation (vv29-31)

[BIRTH_PAINS]: Vv4-8 = early contractions; vv9-14 = intensifying labor; vv15-28 = transition; vv29-31 = DELIVERY
Child = unshakeable kingdom (Heb 12:28), gathered elect (v31), visible King (v30)
Isa 66:7-9 + Rev 12:5 "man child caught up unto God + throne"

Cloud = smoke = judgment-produced theophany:
Ex 19:18 Sinai "smoke of furnace" when LORD descended = thick cloud IS smoke/fire
Rev 15:8 temple "filled with smoke from glory of God"; Rev 9:2 "smoke... sun + air DARKENED"
Rev 18:9,18 "smoke of her [Babylon's] burning"; Joel 2:30 "pillars of SMOKE" before day of LORD
Son of Man comes IN smoke of Babylon's collapse - judgment-fire → smoke/cloud → King appears

Sackcloth = smoke, not mourning: Rev 6:12 "sun black as sackcloth" = dark covering over sun
What IS dark covering? SMOKE - Rev 18:9 Babylon burns → Rev 19:3 smoke rises → Rev 9:2 smoke darkens sun
Rev 11:3 witnesses "clothed in sackcloth" = prophesy INSIDE smoke-darkness of Babylon's collapse

1,260-day convergence: Rev 11:3 (witnesses in sackcloth) = Rev 12:6 (woman nourished) = Rev 11:2 (holy city trodden 42 months) = Rev 13:5 (beast authority 42 months) = Dan 12:7
ALL describe SAME period: Babylon burns → smoke era → witnesses go out through smoke → beast exercises authority

Mat 24 → Revelation sequence: Rev 9:1-2 abyss opens → SMOKE rises → sun darkened
Rev 9:3 agents emerge "OUT OF SMOKE"; Rev 11:7 beast "OUT OF BOTTOMLESS PIT"
