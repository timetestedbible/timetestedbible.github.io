SWORD PANEL: earthquake (24:4-8) → sword (v9 "kill you"). System-shaking → personal persecution. Jer triad completion.

CAUSAL CHAIN (10 steps): persecution (v9) → G4624 skandalizo/TRAP (v10a) → G3860 paradidomi/betray (v10b) → hate (v10c) → G5578 pseudoprophetes rise (v11) → G4105 planao/DECEIVE (v11) → G458 anomia multiplies (v12a) → G26 agape G5594 psycho/breath-cools (v12b) → G5278 hupomeno saves (v13) → gospel completion (v14) → telos.

G3860 paradidomi = Judas vocabulary. Mat 26:15,21,23,24,25,46,48 same word. Judas-pattern scales: individual → communal → systemic betrayal.

NAME = COVENANT: v9 "hated for my NAME" = covenant loyalty. G1484 ethnos (all nations) = v7 nation-against-nation targeting covenant community.

G458 anomia = 2Th 2:7 "mystery of iniquity." V12 anomia plethuno = 2Th 2:3 "man of anomia" mechanism. False prophets → anomia multiplies → agape dies → man of anomia emerges.

Dan 11:32-35 structural twin: corrupt covenant → DECEIVE → FAITH endures → witness → persecution → skandalizo/refining → THE_END arrival. Dan 12:3,10 wisdom/righteousness connection.

G5278 hupomeno = remain-under-weight. Not extraction - persistent presence under pressure. FAITH-as-obedience posture. ≠ pre-trib RAPTURE_GATHERING.

G3625 oikoumene ≠ kosmos: v14 inhabited world, not created order. Luke 2:1 Roman empire. Col 1:23 + Rom 1:8 = first-century fulfillment. Dual-scope: 70 AD + Rev 14:6.

G3142 marturion = witness → martyrdom. Context: v9 killing + Rev 6:9-11 souls under altar. Witness-count completion before end.

Mat 10:17-22 = earlier identical warning: paradidomi + marturion + NAME + endure + saved + end. Olivet = expanded mission-discourse.

FULFILLMENT AUDIT: All elements pattern-recur 30-70 AD → post-70 → eschatological. V13 endure-to-end = structural each generation. V14 gospel-to-oikoumene = dual-scope. THE_END = synteleia total consummation.

ROADMAP CONNECTIONS:
RAPTURE_GATHERING - absent vv9-14, contradicts endurance-posture
RETURN_OF_CHRIST - THE_END (v14) = parousia condition, gospel-completion prerequisite  
FALL_OF_BABYLON - anomia multiplying = mystery iniquity = internal corruption mechanism
SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION - "then the end" (v14) → 1Th 5:3, witness-completion triggers telos
DAYS_OF_NOAH - persecution + anomia = Gen 6:5,11 violence/corruption + normalcy
THIRD_DAY - endurance through suffering → saved = Hos 6:2 death → resurrection pattern
DAY_AS_1000_YEARS - explains delay between gospel-preached + end-comes

TELOS/TELEO CHAIN: Mat 24:14 marturion complete → telos = Rev 11:7 testimony telesōsin = Rev 10:7 mystery telesthē = 1Cor 15:24 kingdom transfer. Same event.

SACKCLOTH = SMOKE: Rev 6:12 sun black as sackcloth = Rev 9:2 smoke-darkened = Rev 18:9,18 Babylon burning. Rev 11:3 witnesses clothed in sackcloth = prophesy inside smoke-darkness.

AMOS 8:9-12: witnesses die → word withdrawn → sun dark → sackcloth → famine of hearing. Darkening = testimony silenced, not just authority collapse.

MAT 24:9-14 = REV 11:3-7 WITNESS PERIOD: Gospel-to-nations (v14) = 1,260-day prophesying in smoke. Persecution (v9) = witnesses killed after completion. Anomia multiplying (v12) = holy city trodden 42 months. Scattering-to-mountains = witness-mechanism = sackcloth-period.

ABSENT: ABOMINATION (v15 trigger follows this panel). DARKNESS (v29, but seeded via marturion vocabulary). TRUMPET/GATHERING (v31). SLEEP (unnamed, psycho v12 = mechanism). COME_OUT (deferred v16). This = internal collapse enabling abomination. Anomia fills holy space before man of anomia stands in it.
