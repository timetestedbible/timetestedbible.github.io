SWORD PANEL: earthquake (24:4-8) → sword (v9 "kill you"). System-shaking → personal persecution. Jer triad completion.

CAUSAL CHAIN (10 steps): persecution (v9) → G4624 skandalizo/TRAP (v10a) → G3860 paradidomi/betray (v10b) → hate (v10c) → G5578 pseudoprophetes rise (v11) → G4105 planao/DECEIVE (v11) → G458 anomia multiplies (v12a) → G26 agape G5594 psycho/breath-cools (v12b) → G5278 hupomeno saves (v13) → gospel completion (v14) → telos.

G3860 paradidomi = Judas vocabulary. Mat 26:15,21,23,24,25,46,48 same word. Judas-pattern scales: individual → communal → systemic betrayal.

NAME = COVENANT: v9 "hated for my NAME" = covenant loyalty. G1484 ethnos (all nations) = v7 nation-against-nation targeting covenant community.

G458 anomia = 2Th 2:7 "mystery of iniquity." V12 anomia plethuno = 2Th 2:3 "man of anomia" mechanism. False prophets → anomia multiplies → agape dies → man of anomia emerges.

Dan 11:32-35 structural twin: corrupt covenant → DECEIVE → FAITH endures → witness → persecution → skandalizo/refining → THE_END arrival. Dan 12:3,10 wisdom/righteousness connection.

G5278 hupomeno = remain-under-weight. Not extraction - persistent presence under pressure. FAITH-as-obedience posture. ≠ pre-trib RAPTURE_GATHERING.

G3625 oikoumene ≠ kosmos: v14 inhabited world, not created order. Luke 2:1 Roman empire. Col 1:23 + Rom 1:8 = first-century fulfillment. Dual-scope: 70 AD + Rev 14:6.

G3142 marturion = witness → martyrdom. Context: v9 killing + Rev 6:9-11 souls under altar. Witness-count completion before end.

Mat 10:17-22 = earlier identical warning: paradidomi + marturion + NAME + endure + saved + end. Olivet = expanded mission-discourse.

FULFILLMENT AUDIT: All elements pattern-recur 30-70 AD → post-70 → eschatological. V13 endure-to-end = structural each generation. V14 gospel-to-oikoumene = dual-scope. THE_END = synteleia total consummation.

ROADMAP CONNECTIONS:
RAPTURE_GATHERING - absent vv9-14, contradicts endurance-posture
RETURN_OF_CHRIST - THE_END (v14) = parousia condition, gospel-completion prerequisite  
FALL_OF_BABYLON - anomia multiplying = mystery iniquity = internal corruption mechanism
SUDDEN_DESTRUCTION - "then the end" (v14) → 1Th 5:3, witness-completion triggers telos
DAYS_OF_NOAH - persecution + anomia = Gen 6:5,11 violence/corruption + normalcy
THIRD_DAY - endurance through suffering → saved = Hos 6:2 death → resurrection pattern
DAY_AS_1000_YEARS - explains delay between gospel-preached + end-comes

TELOS/TELEO CHAIN: Mat 24:14 marturion complete → telos = Rev 11:7 testimony telesōsin = Rev 10:7 mystery telesthē = 1Cor 15:24 kingdom transfer. Same event.

SACKCLOTH = SMOKE: Rev 6:12 sun black as sackcloth = Rev 9:2 smoke-darkened = Rev 18:9,18 Babylon burning. Rev 11:3 witnesses clothed in sackcloth = prophesy inside smoke-darkness.

AMOS 8:9-12: witnesses die → word withdrawn → sun dark → sackcloth → famine of hearing. Darkening = testimony silenced, not just authority collapse.

MAT 24:9-14 = REV 11:3-7 WITNESS PERIOD: Gospel-to-nations (v14) = 1,260-day prophesying in smoke. Persecution (v9) = witnesses killed after completion. Anomia multiplying (v12) = holy city trodden 42 months. Scattering-to-mountains = witness-mechanism = sackcloth-period.

ABSENT: ABOMINATION (v15 trigger follows this panel). DARKNESS (v29, but seeded via marturion vocabulary). TRUMPET/GATHERING (v31). SLEEP (unnamed, psycho v12 = mechanism). COME_OUT (deferred v16). This = internal collapse enabling abomination. Anomia fills holy space before man of anomia stands in it.

## Phase 2 Propagation

**Paths followed:** THE_END→Dan/12.001-013+Amos/8.001-014, WICKEDNESS→2Th/2.001-012, SUN_MOON_STARS→Amos/8.001-014, RAPTURE_GATHERING→2Th/2.001-012, RETURN_OF_CHRIST→Rev/11.001-019, NAME→Rev/6.009-011.

**New connections:**

1. **TELEO CHAIN REINFORCED VIA REV 11.** Rev 11 context: "beast CANNOT act until testimony teleo'd — witness-period PROTECTED." Mat 24:14 gospel→telos = Rev 11:7 telesōsin→beast kills witnesses. The 10-step causal chain (v9-14) IS the mechanism by which Rev 11:3-7's witness period unfolds. Completion OPENS the door to v15's abomination.

2. **ANOMIA = MYSTERY BABYLON SURFACING.** 2Th 2 context: "mystery of iniquity" (2Th 2:7) = "MYSTERY BABYLON" (Rev 17:5) — same covert principle. V12's G458 anomia plethuno is the mystery emerging visibly. Rev 18:23 "by thy sorceries all nations DECEIVED" = v11 false prophets at global scale.

3. **AMOS 8:9-12 = INVERSE OF MAT 24:14.** Amos 8 context: "word withdrawn → sun dark → famine → seek and not find." Mat 24:9-14 = testimony ACTIVE (gospel preached). These are opposite states of ONE mechanism. V14's completion triggers the Amos 8:11 transition: available→withdrawn. The telos IS the pivot between light and famine.

4. **REV 6:9-11 MARTYR-QUOTA = V9+V14 FILLING MECHANISM.** Fifth seal: martyrs' blood accumulates until "fellowservants fulfilled [G4137 pleroo]." V9 "kill you" + v14 "then the telos" = the witness that fills the quota. The "how long?" cry (Rev 6:10) is answered by the endurance-to-completion chain.

5. **2TH 2:1 SEQUENCING CONFIRMS POST-ANOMIA GATHERING.** Episunagōgē (2Th 2:1) CANNOT precede apostasia + man-of-sin. V12's anomia-multiplication IS the apostasia unfolding; gathering comes AFTER this panel, not during it.

**Convergence:** Mat 24:9-14 = the filling mechanism for BOTH Rev 6:9-11's martyr-quota AND Rev 11:7's teleo-trigger. The graph reveals vv9-14 aren't just "things that happen" — they're the testimony-completion engine that controls when the telos arrives.
