# Symbol Identification: Mat 24:4-8

# Scripture Analysis: Matthew 24:4-8

## Recalled Text (from memory)
Jesus answers the disciples' question about the sign of His coming and end of the age. He warns of deception, false Christs, wars/rumors of wars, nation rising against nation, famines, pestilences, and earthquakes — calling these "the beginning of sorrows/birth pains."

## Thought-Unit Boundary Assessment

RANGE: **Mat 24:3-14** (adjusted)

**Reasoning:** Verse 3 provides the essential framing question (disciples asking about the sign of His coming and the end of the age) — without it, vv.4-8 lack their prompt. The thought-unit continues through v.14 ("this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world... then shall the end come"), which completes the first block of Jesus' answer. Verses 4-8 are a sub-unit but not a complete thought — the "beginning of sorrows" in v.8 signals continuation. However, I will analyze **vv.4-8 as requested**, noting the boundary issue.

## KNOWN SYMBOLS FOUND

- **"be deceived" / "shall deceive" (G4105 — planaō)** → WAY/THE WAY connection — to be led astray from *the way*; deception is departure from Torah/God's commandments. The word appears three times in this sub-unit (vv.4, 5, implied in pattern), establishing a dominant theme.

- **"name" (G3686)** — v.5: "many shall come *in my name*" → NAME — Covenant / Covenant Relationship. Coming "in my name" means claiming covenant authority; the false claimants exploit the covenant relationship.

- **"nation" (G1484 — ethnos)** — v.7: "nation shall rise against nation" → TREE-adjacent concept. Ethnos is a people group, and cross-referencing with the TREE symbol (nation/people group) reveals patterned usage. Nations here function as identifiable people-groups in conflict.

- **"kingdom" (G932 — basileia)** — v.7: "kingdom against kingdom" → MOUNTAIN — Kingdom / Ruling Authority. Basileia maps directly to the MOUNTAIN symbol; kingdoms as ruling authorities clashing.

- **"famines" (G3042 — limos)** — v.7 → Thematically linked to BREAD (Word / Covenant Terms). Scripture patterns famine as absence of God's word (Amos 8:11). Physical famine symbolizes covenant-word deprivation.

- **"earthquakes" (G4578 — seismos)** — v.7 → Connected to MOUNTAIN/KINGDOM shaking. When mountains/kingdoms are shaken, the earth quakes — judgment on ruling authorities (cf. Hag 2:6-7, Heb 12:26-27).

## NEW SYMBOL CANDIDATES

- **"beginning of sorrows/birth pains" (G5604 — ōdin)** — v.8. This is a major candidate. Used across Scripture (Isa 13:8, 1 Thes 5:3, Jer 4:31, Mic 4:9-10). Birth pains consistently symbolize **covenant transition / the painful emergence of a new covenant reality**. Studying ōdin across all Scripture absolutely reveals a pattern: judgment that produces deliverance, travail preceding new creation.

- **"wars and rumors of wars" (G4171 — polemos)** — v.6. War language across prophetic Scripture patterns as **covenant conflict / judgment execution** (cf. Joel 2, Rev 19:11). The pairing of actual wars with *rumors* of wars suggests both visible and reported/distant covenant disruption.

- **"the end" (G5056 — telos)** — v.6: "the end is not yet." Telos across Scripture carries weight as **fulfillment / covenant completion** — not mere cessation but arrival at purpose (Rom 10:4, 1 Pet 1:9). Strong candidate.

- **"pestilences" (G3061 — loimos)** — v.7 (in some manuscripts). Pestilence in prophetic Scripture patterns as **covenant curse** (Deut 28:21, Ezek 14:21). Sent when covenant is broken.

- **"Christ" (G5547 — Christos)** — v.5: "I am the Christ." Christos = Anointed One, directly linked to OIL (anointing/G5548). False Christs claim **false anointing / counterfeit covenant authority**.

## SKIPPED (borderline, explaining why)

- **"divers places" (G5117 — topos)** — v.7. While "place" can carry weight in some contexts (John 14:2-3, Deut 12:5 — the chosen place), here it functions as geographic scaffolding ("in various places") rather than carrying independent symbolic weight.

- **"hear" (G191 — akouō)** — v.6: "ye shall hear of wars." Akouō can carry covenant weight (Shema tradition), but here it functions as narrative scaffolding describing the disciples' experience.

- **"troubled" (G2360 — throeō)** — v.6: "see that ye be not troubled." Borderline — emotional response language. Does not reveal a consistent cross-Scripture symbolic pattern.

- **"must come to pass" (G1163 — dei)** — v.6. Divine necessity language. Theologically significant but functions as structural/grammatical scaffolding rather than a symbol per se.
