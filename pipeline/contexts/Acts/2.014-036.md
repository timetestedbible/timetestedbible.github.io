## What the Pipeline Adds

**"THIS IS THAT" (v16) = PETER PLACES THE CHURCH AGE INSIDE JOEL'S "BEFORE THE GREAT DAY" WINDOW.** Peter does not say Joel is "partly fulfilled" or "analogous." He says τοῦτό ἐστιν (this IS that) — the Pentecost event IS the Joel 2:28-32 outpouring. This means EVERYTHING Joel 2:28-32 describes — Spirit poured out, blood+fire+smoke, sun darkened, moon→blood — is a SINGLE prophetic window that OPENS at Pentecost. The church age operates INSIDE the "before the great and notable day of the Lord" (v20) period. The signs are not future-only; they are the CHARACTER of the entire era launched at Pentecost.

### BLOOD + FIRE + VAPOUR OF SMOKE = JOEL'S SIGNS APPLIED TO CURRENT ERA (v19)

v19 "blood (G129 haima), fire (G4442 pur), vapour (G822 atmis) of smoke (G2586 kapnos)." BLOOD study: life of flesh made visible — when taken, accuses; when displayed, marks judgment. FIRE study: God's covenant standard in active contact. SMOKE study: visible ascending evidence of fire's application; the BRIDGE between fire and darkness (Rev 9:2 smoke darkens sun). The Joel 2 context already established the production chain: fire → pillars of smoke → authority-darkening. Peter quotes this chain at Pentecost, not as distant future but as inaugurated reality.

The SMOKE study's critical finding: FIRE→SMOKE→DARKNESS→SON OF MAN APPEARS IN CLOUDS. If Peter says "this is that," the smoke-era has BEGUN. Acts 2:3 "cloven tongues like as of fire" = the fire that launches the smoke-era. The Spirit-fire at Pentecost BEGINS the period whose smoke progressively obscures the governing authorities until the Son of Man appears through/in the smoke-clouds.

### SUN→DARKNESS, MOON→BLOOD = AUTHORITY COLLAPSE IN PROGRESS (v20)

v20 "sun shall be turned into darkness (G4655 skotos), moon into blood." SUN_MOON_STARS study: sun = supreme authority, moon = derivative authority, darkening = authority collapse/removal under God's judgment (NOT literal astronomy). 15 darkening oracles identified, all tied to specific nation-judgments (Babylon Isa 13:10, Egypt Ezek 32:7, etc). The Joel 2 context notes: the army IS what darkens (vv2-11) — the invading force IS the smoke-cloud that blots out governing authorities.

Peter's quotation places this darkening process BEFORE "the great and notable day" (v20b). The DARKNESS study: darkness = concealed disobedience. The authority-darkening = governing systems increasingly operating in hidden disobedience. The moon turning to blood (blood study: life of flesh made visible, accusing) = derivative/reflected authorities becoming testimony of shed innocent blood. Rev 6:12 same language: moon as blood at 6th seal.

The sun-moon-stars study notes: "Babylon burns → smoke rises → sun black-as-sackcloth → Christ appears in clouds/smoke." Peter says this PROCESS started at Pentecost. The entire church-age witness-period is the progressive darkening between Pentecost and parousia.

### SPIRIT OUTPOURING = WITNESS PERIOD LAUNCHED (vv17-18)

v17-18 quotes Joel 2:28-29: Spirit poured on ALL flesh → sons/daughters PROPHESY → servants/handmaidens prophesy. The Joel 2 context identified: witness period opens with Spirit-poured-out (Joel 2:28/Acts 2) and closes with witnesses-killed (Rev 11:7). Between these bookends: the 1,260-day sackcloth/smoke period. Rev 11:3-4 witnesses = lampstands + olive trees = oil (proven works) + lamp (commandment) = Spirit-filled testimony.

Peter CHANGES Joel's "afterward" (H310 acharey) to "in the last days" (G2078 eschatos + G2250 hemera). Interpretive insertion: the Spirit-era IS the last days. Not preliminary to eschatology — it IS the eschatological period. The "last days" = the entire era between Pentecost and the "great and notable day."

v18 "and they shall PROPHESY" — added emphasis not in Joel's Hebrew. Peter underscores: the Spirit's purpose = testimony/witness (marturion, cf Mat 24:14 "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness"). The Spirit-outpouring is the engine of the witness-period.

### DAVID'S TESTIMONY → RESURRECTION → EXALTATION (vv25-36)

Peter quotes Ps 16:8-11 (vv25-28) and Ps 110:1 (vv34-35). Two Davidic psalms framing one argument: (1) Ps 16: God will not leave His soul in hades or allow His Holy One to see corruption → THIRD_DAY study: covenant restoration / God's decisive act completing judgment-to-life transition. Hos 6:2 "third day raise up" (LXX anistēmi = resurrection). Christ's resurrection = the defining 3rd-day event that all prior 3rd-day patterns (Gen 22:4 Isaac, Jonah, Exod 19:11 Sinai) pointed toward.

v29 Peter's argument: David IS dead and buried (tomb still here) → David spoke NOT of himself but of Christ. v30 "being a prophet" — David's words are PROPHETIC, not autobiographical. v31 "seeing this BEFORE" (G4275 proeido) = foresaw. The Psalms are prophetic testimony, not merely devotional.

(2) Ps 110:1 "LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, UNTIL I make thy foes thy footstool." RETURN_OF_CHRIST study: the "until" establishes the current session as a WAITING PERIOD — Christ reigns at God's right hand while enemies are progressively subdued. The "footstool" completion = the parousia. v33 "by the right hand of God exalted" + "received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit" + "shed forth this" — the Spirit-outpouring IS evidence of Christ's current exaltation. Pentecost proves the resurrection-and-session.

v36 "God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ." The conclusion = the KINGDOM IS ALREADY TRANSFERRED to Christ. Rev 11:15 "kingdoms become the Lord's" is the PUBLIC manifestation of what Acts 2:36 declares as already accomplished in the heavenly register. The trumpet (Isa 27:13, Mat 24:31) announces what is already true — not the beginning of Christ's reign but its VISIBLE manifestation.

### STRUCTURAL ARC: PENTECOST → JOEL → RESURRECTION → SESSION → PAROUSIA

vv14-21: Joel quotation = places NOW inside eschatological window.
vv22-28: Jesus' ministry + death + resurrection = 3rd-day fulfillment.
vv29-31: David's prophecy = this was foreknown, not accidental.
vv32-36: Therefore exalted → Spirit poured → Lord and Christ NOW.

The logic: resurrection PROVES exaltation → exaltation PRODUCES Spirit-outpouring → Spirit-outpouring IS Joel's prophecy → Joel's prophecy includes blood+fire+smoke+darkening → therefore the entire sign-sequence is INAUGURATED, not merely predicted.

### ROADMAP

(1) **RETURN_OF_CHRIST** — v20 "before the great and notable day of the Lord" = the parousia is the CLOSING EVENT of the window opened at Pentecost. v35 "until I make thy foes thy footstool" = the session-period before visible return.
(2) **RAPTURE_GATHERING** — v21 "whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" = Joel 2:32 covenant deliverance. The Name study: NAME = COVENANT. Calling on the name = invoking covenant relationship for the gathering.
(3) **FALL_OF_BABYLON** — v19-20 blood+fire+smoke+darkening = the Babylon-burning sequence (Rev 18:8-9,18) applied to the entire era, not a single event. Smoke from Babylon's burning obscures the sun → authorities collapse.
(4) **THIRD_DAY** — vv24-32 resurrection as the decisive 3rd-day act. Hos 6:2 fulfilled. The entire Spirit-era is launched FROM the 3rd day.

## Recommended Studies

- **Joel 2:1-32 Context** — Peter quotes Joel 2:28-32, but the Joel context reveals the FULL STRUCTURE Peter is invoking: army=smoke=darkening (vv2-11), northern army=Babylon (v20), dual trumpet warning+gathering (v1+v15), restoration of years the locust ate (v25). Peter's audience would know the whole chapter. The blood+fire+smoke signs are not isolated — they sit inside Joel's invasion→repentance→restoration→Spirit→deliverance arc. Acts 2 = the SPIRIT stage; the DELIVERANCE stage is still ahead.

- **SMOKE** — v19 "vapour of smoke" connects to the study's central discovery: smoke is the BRIDGE between fire (judgment applied) and darkness (authority obscured). The chain FIRE→SMOKE→DARKNESS→SON OF MAN APPEARS explains why Peter lists these signs BEFORE the "great day" — the smoke-producing era IS the church age. Rev 9:2 sun darkened "by reason of smoke" + Rev 11:3 witnesses prophesy in sackcloth (= smoke-covering) for 1,260 days = the witness period IS the smoke period.

- **SUN_MOON_STARS** — v20 sun→darkness + moon→blood. The study identifies 15 darkening oracles, ALL tied to specific governance collapses (not astronomical events). Peter's application places this darkening in the "before the great day" window = the progressive collapse of governing authority during the church age. Key finding: Babylon burns → smoke rises → sun-as-sackcloth → Christ appears in clouds/smoke. The darkening is not one catastrophic moment but the cumulative effect of the smoke-era.

- **Mal 4:1-6 Context** — Malachi's "great and dreadful day of the LORD" (Mal 4:5) = Peter's "great and notable day of the Lord" (Acts 2:20) = SAME EVENT. Malachi sends Elijah BEFORE it; Peter says the Spirit IS the "before" period. Mal 4:5 Elijah turning hearts = Acts 2:38 Peter calling for repentance. The church-age witness-period IS the Elijah-function. If Elijah's mission fails: cherem (Mal 4:6). If it succeeds: hearts turn, covenant restored, gathering follows.
