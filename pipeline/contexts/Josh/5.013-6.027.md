## What the Pipeline Adds

**7/7 SYMBOL CONVERGENCE — FIRST CHEREM EXECUTION = BABYLON-FALL TEMPLATE.** Josh 6 is the ORIGIN narrative for the fall-of-babylon pattern. Structure: 7 priests + 7 trumpets + 7 days + 7th-day 7-fold circuit → shout → walls collapse → total cherem. Rev 8-11's 7 trumpet sequence IS this pattern at cosmic scale: sequential trumpet blasts culminating in kingdom-transfer (Rev 11:15 "kingdoms of this world become kingdoms of our Lord"). Josh 6:20 wall falls H5307 naphal = same root-concept as Isa 21:9/Rev 14:8/Rev 18:2 "fallen, fallen is Babylon." Jericho doesn't merely foreshadow Babylon — it IS the first Babylon-fall enacted in covenant history.

**CAPTAIN WITH DRAWN SWORD (5:13-15) = COMMANDER OF CHEREM.** The "man" with H2719 chereb (sword) drawn identifies as "captain of the host of the LORD" (H6635 tsaba = army). Joshua falls on face → told to remove sandals → holy ground. Exact replay of Exod 3:5 (Moses at burning bush). Sword study: chereb from H2717 charab = desolation-maker. The drawn sword BEFORE the battle means the cherem verdict is already decreed. The 7-day circuit is not siege warfare — it's ceremonial execution of a pre-issued sentence. 5:15 holy ground = ground under cherem jurisdiction transfers holiness-danger (same reason Uzzah died touching the ark, 2Sam 6:7).

**SEVEN TRUMPETS = COVENANT SIGNAL, NOT MILITARY TACTIC.** H7782 shophar × 14 occurrences in Josh 6 (7 trumpets mentioned twice per circuit). Trumpet study: shophar = authoritative signal initiating kingdom transfer. Josh 6:4-5 seven H3548 priests bearing seven H7782 shophars before the H727 ark = the LITURGICAL procession, not a battle formation. Silence commanded (6:10) until the shout — the people are WORSHIPPERS, not soldiers. The walls fall by obedient process + divine action, not human force. Heb 11:30 "by FAITH [G4102 pistis] the walls of Jericho fell down." Faith-as-weapon = trumpet-as-weapon: the instrument is covenant obedience, the power is God's.

**CHEREM CONTAGION — THE CENTRAL WARNING (6:17-18).** V17 H2764 cherem: city + everything in it = devoted to LORD. V18 "keep yourselves FROM the cherem, lest ye make yourselves cherem." Cherem study: H2764 = physical enclosure (net) + irrevocable divine claim. Contagion principle: TOUCHING cherem MAKES YOU cherem. Josh 7:1,11-12 Achan proves it — took cherem goods → Israel became cherem → defeated at Ai. This is the mechanism behind Rev 18:4 "come out of her, lest ye be PARTAKERS of her plagues." Babylon = cherem-system. Remaining in it transfers the ban. Jericho establishes the principle; Revelation applies it globally.

**RAHAB EXTRACTION = "COME OUT OF HER" PATTERN.** V17 "only Rahab the harlot shall live." V22-23 spies extract Rahab + entire household BEFORE fire (v24). Sequence: extraction → cherem → fire. Identical to Gen 19:16,22 (Lot extracted → Sodom burned), Jer 51:45 ("my people, go ye out"), Rev 18:4 ("come out of her, my people"). Rahab's scarlet cord (Josh 2:18,21) marks her house for extraction — covenant-blood marker amid cherem-zone. Scarlet study: H8144 shaniy = blood/covenant marker. The H8615 tiqvah ("line" = literally "hope/cord") is the same word translated "hope" in Ruth 1:12 and Job 4:6. Her CORD of hope = her covenant-marker.

**FIRE AS FINAL ACT (V24).** "Burnt the city with fire [H784 esh] and all therein." Fire study: fire = God's holy standard consuming what violates covenant. Sequence: trumpet → walls fall → sword (v21 "edge of sword") → fire (v24). This is the EXACT sequence in Rev 18-19: trumpet announcement (Rev 11:15) → fall (Rev 18:2) → sword (Rev 19:15,21) → fire (Rev 18:8, 19:20). Josh 6 writes the template that Rev 18-19 fulfills.

**FIRSTBORN CURSE (V26).** "Cursed be the man that buildeth Jericho: lay foundation in firstborn, set up gates in youngest son." 1Kgs 16:34 Hiel of Bethel rebuilt Jericho — lost firstborn Abiram (foundation) + youngest Segub (gates). Cherem-city CANNOT be rebuilt without covenant-cost. Babylon rebuilt = covenant-death. This is why Rev 18:21 "shall be found NO MORE" — the cherem is permanent. Rebuilding what God has devoted = paying with your seed.

## Recommended Studies

- **CHEREM** — V17-18 uses H2764 three times in two verses — the densest cherem cluster outside Lev 27. The cherem study reveals the net-meaning (H2764 = both "devoted thing" AND "net"): God's cherem is a NET that encloses everything within its boundary. Josh 6:18 "lest ye make yourselves cherem" establishes contagion as a physical law, not a metaphor. This is the operating principle behind EVERY "come out" command in Scripture — from Jer 51:45 through Rev 18:4. Without understanding cherem-contagion, the extraction-urgency of Rev 18:4 reads as optional advice rather than survival protocol.

- **TRUMPET** — 14 shophar references in one chapter is the highest density in any narrative passage. The trumpet study maps the arc: Sinai (covenant given, Exod 19:16) → Jericho (covenant executed) → Jubilee (Lev 25:9, liberty proclaimed) → Mat 24:31 (gathering) → 1Cor 15:52 (last trumpet) → Rev 11:15 (7th trumpet = kingdom transfer). Josh 6's 7 trumpets are the narrative KEY to Rev 8-11's 7 trumpets: both are liturgical sequences ending in total regime change. The silence before the shout (6:10) = Rev 8:1 silence before the trumpets.

- **FALL-OF-BABYLON** — Jericho IS the first Babylon: fortified city, shut up against God's people, destroyed by divine action not siege. The study traces "fallen, fallen" from Isa 21:9 → Jer 51:8 → Rev 14:8 → Rev 18:2, but the PATTERN begins here. Josh 6:20 naphal (wall fell flat) is the verb-root of every subsequent "fallen." The 7-day process → sudden collapse pattern reappears as Rev 8-11's trumpet sequence → Rev 18 sudden destruction. Jericho = template; Babylon the Great = final fulfillment.

## Phase 2 Propagation

**REV 11:15 → 7TH TRUMPET = JERICHO'S 7TH CIRCUIT.** Rev 11:15 "seventh angel sounded" → "kingdoms of this world become kingdoms of our Lord." Josh 6:16 seventh circuit + seventh trumpet → "LORD hath given you the city." Both: 7th trumpet = transfer of sovereignty. The trumpet study notes this but the NARRATIVE template is Josh 6. Rev 8:1 silence in heaven for half hour → Josh 6:10 silence until "I bid you shout." Silence→trumpet→shout→fall = identical sequence.

**JOSH 7:1-26 → CHEREM CONTAGION PROVEN.** Achan took H2764 cherem from Jericho → Israel became H2764 cherem (7:12 "neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the cherem from among you"). One man's violation infected the entire camp. 36 died at Ai because of Achan's private theft. The cherem study references this but the Josh 6→7 SEQUENCE is what proves the warning of 6:18 is physical law, not hyperbole.

**HEB 11:30-31 → FAITH SEQUENCE.** Heb 11:30 "by faith walls fell" + 11:31 "by faith the harlot Rahab perished not." Two faiths, one event: Israel's corporate obedience (circling in silence) + Rahab's individual trust (scarlet cord in window). Both saved from the cherem by faith — but through different mechanisms: Israel by executing the cherem, Rahab by being extracted from it. This dual-faith pattern maps to Rev 18:4-20: God's people called OUT of Babylon (Rahab-pattern) while Babylon itself falls (Jericho-pattern).
