## ENTIRE OLIVET DISCOURSE COMPRESSED TO 19 VERSES
v1-2 measuring temple = defining covenant community = Mat 24:4-8
v3 witnesses prophesy 1,260 days in sackcloth = Mat 24:14 gospel to all nations
v7 beast kills witnesses after FINISH = Mat 24:15 abomination triggered by testimony completion
vv9-10 bodies lie 3.5 days = Mat 24:21-22 distress(G2347 thlipsis) shortened  
vv11-12 resurrection + ascent in cloud = Mat 24:31 gathering
v13 earthquake, tenth of city falls = Mat 24:29 powers shaken
v15 seventh trumpet, kingdoms transfer = Mat 24:30 Son of Man in power
v18 wrath, judgment, rewards = Mat 24:31 consummation
v19 ark revealed = covenant unveiled

## TELEO/TELOS CHAIN - THE LINCHPIN
v7 "hotan telesōsin tēn marturian" [G5055] = when they FINISH testimony
Rev 10:7 "mystery telesthē" [G5055] = Mat 24:14 "then the telos" [G5056] = 1Cor 15:24 "then telos"
Testimony/mystery completion → telos arrives → kingdom transferred [v15]
FINISHING witness = trigger for end

## 7TH TRUMPET = LAST TRUMP CONVERGENCE
v15 seventh angel sounds = 1Cor 15:52 "last trump" = 1Th 4:16 "trump of God" = Mat 24:31 "great trumpet" = Isa 27:13
Same event: kingdom transferred [v15] || dead judged [v18] || saints rewarded [v18] || destroyers destroyed [v18] || ark revealed [v19] || earthquake [v19]

## BEAST FROM ABYSS = BEAST FROM SMOKE  
v7 "beast from bottomless pit" [G12 abussos] = Rev 9:1-2 abyss opens + smoke darkens sun
Sequence: Babylon burns → smoke covers sun → beast emerges from smoke → kills witnesses AFTER finish
Mat 24:14→15 causal: gospel completion triggers abomination

## SACKCLOTH = SMOKE = BABYLON'S BURNING
v3 witnesses "clothed in sackcloth" = Rev 6:12 "sun black as sackcloth" = Rev 9:2 "sun darkened by smoke"
Same period [1,260 days], same word [G4526 sakkos], same physical reality
Witnesses prophesy INSIDE smoke atmosphere of burning Babylon
When witnesses die [v7], word withdrawn, sun fully dark [Amos 8:9-12]

## "GREAT CITY, SPIRITUALLY SODOM AND EGYPT" [v8] = BABYLON
Sodom + Egypt + where Lord crucified = functional Babylon-system
Names = FUNCTIONAL, not geographic
Jerusalem becomes Babylon when operating as worldly system

## 3.5 DAYS = THIRD-DAY PATTERN COMPRESSED  
vv9-11 dead 3.5 days → "Spirit of life entered" → "stood upon feet"
Direct resurrection pattern = Hos 6:2 "third day raise us up"
Half of 7 = incomplete death period before restoration
"Great fear" = recognition moment [Zech 12:10]

## ASCENT IN CLOUD = GATHERING
v12 "Come up hither...ascended in cloud" = 1Th 4:17 "caught up in clouds"
Cloud = smoke they prophesied through [v3] now carries them up
Ascend to MEET descending Lord [apantēsis]

## "DESTROY DESTROYERS" [v18] = JER 51:25
G1311 diaphtheirō x2 = execute judgment on Babylon [destroying mountain]
7th trumpet = active execution of "fallen fallen" announcements

## ARK REVEALED [v19] = COVENANT/NAME UNVEILED
Temple opens, ark seen = covenant revealed [name = covenant]
Lightnings + voices + thunderings + earthquake + hail = Sinai theophany [Ex 19:16-18] repeated
Bookend: Sinai → 7th trumpet

## 1,260 DAYS/42 MONTHS CONVERGENCE
v2 [42 months trodden] = v3 [1,260 days witnesses] = Rev 12:6,14 = Rev 13:5 = Dan 12:7  
Six vantage points, one period: city trodden || witnesses prophesy || woman sheltered || beast reigns - ALL CONCURRENT

## TWO OLIVE TREES + LAMPSTANDS [v4] = OIL + LAMP
Zech 4:2-3,11-14 source: olive branches supply lampstand through pipes
Witnesses = both oil source [proven works] + lampstand [commandment]
Production chain: tree → pressing → oil → lamp → light
"Standing before God" = priestly function [Deut 10:8]

## FIRE FROM MOUTH [v5] = WORD AS FIRE  
Jer 5:14 "words in mouth fire" + Jer 23:29 "word like fire"
Not literal flame but covenantal authority - word tests everything

## 7-EVENT ROADMAP CONVERGENCE
Rapture [v12 ascent] || Return [v15 kingdoms] || Fall Babylon [v18 destroyers] ||
