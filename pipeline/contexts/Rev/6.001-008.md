CONVERGENCE: Rev 6 = Zech 6 = Zech 1 = Ezek 14:21 = Mat 24:4-8 (same four-agent mechanism)
Zech 6:5 → chariots+horses = "four spirits (H7307 ruach) of heavens" = four winds of Jer 49:36, Dan 7:2, Rev 7:1
Structural tetrad alignment: conquest/deception → war → famine → death/pestilence across all passages
Ezek 14:21 tetrad (sword H2719, famine H7458, beast H2416, pestilence H1698) = Rev 6:8 kill-list (sword G4501, hunger G3042, death G2288, beasts G2342)

REORDERING: Zech order (red-black-white-grisled) → Rev order (white-red-black-pale) follows Mat 24 sequence
White first ∵ deception = archē G746 (ruling principle) → causal cascade: counterfeit authority → peace removed → economic disruption → death
Mat 24:4-8 archē = birth-pains ROOT, not chronological start

SEAL MECHANISM = WIND-RESTRAINT: Rev 5:1 scroll sealed (G4973 sphragis) → Rev 6:1 seals opened → horsemen released
Rev 7:1-3 four angels HOLD four winds || servants SEALED (G4972 sphragizo) - same root
Inverse operations concurrent: covenant curses unleashed || covenant protection applied
Timing ≠ sequential, = simultaneous restraint+release

FOUR ZOON AS DISPATCHERS: Rev 4:6-8 lion-calf-man-eagle = Ezek 1:10 cherubim faces
Each zoon commands "Come!" (G2064 erchomai imperative) → horseman dispatched
Command chain: Lamb opens → zoon commands → horseman rides
Divine sovereignty at every level

DELEGATED AUTHORITY: "given" (G1325 didomi) passive - crown given (6:2), power given (6:4), sword given (6:4), authority given (6:8)
∅ independent action - matches Zech 6:5 "go forth from standing before Lord" + Job 1:12 Satan's permission
Covenant judgment = sovereign, ≠ chaotic

RESTRAINT WITHIN JUDGMENT: 6:6 "hurt not (G91 adikeo) oil + wine" during famine
Oil = Spirit/anointing, wine = covenant blood/joy
|| Rev 7:3 "hurt not...till sealed" - four horsemen/winds operate under LIMITS
Echoes Ezek 14:20 Noah-Daniel-Job deliver own souls - judgment respects covenant faithfulness

FOURTH HORSEMAN = SUMMARY: Pale (chloros G5515) = Death (thanatos G2288) + Hades following
Authority over "fourth part (tetartos G5067) of earth"
Kills with ALL four methods: sword+hunger+death+beasts = Ezek 14:21 tetrad in one figure
Structure: horsemen 1-3 individual agents, horseman 4 = composite consequence

PATTERN-RECUR STATUS: Jerusalem 586 BC + 70 AD + ongoing cycles → future/final
70 AD = strongest first-century match (false messiahs Acts 5:36, Roman wars, Acts 11:28 famine, 1.1M dead)
Birth pains intensify through cycles - seals ≠ single-event but recurring escalation

ROADMAP: Four horsemen = pre-gathering judgment mechanism of Babylon's fall
Rev 19:11 white horse (Christ) ANSWERS counterfeit 6:2 white horse
Horsemen ride during "peace+safety" (1Th 5:3) period - their effects = birth pains → sudden destruction
Pre-trumpet timing (trumpets begin Rev 8:1-2), pre-cosmic darkening (seal 6), pre-fire judgments

G5115 toxon (bow) ONLY NT occurrence - weapon of distance/deception, strikes at range ≠ face-to-face sword
H5117 nuach (quieted) Zech 6:8 - horsemen's mission satisfies/avenges God's spirit = covenant equilibrium
Chloros G5515 = green/life-color on DEATH agent = inversion: apparent life masking active death
Anonymous first three horsemen (only Death named) - deception/war/famine operate without announcing

MISSING ELEMENTS: trumpet, darkness, sea domain, fire, named identity (first 3)
Sea explicitly withheld Rev 7:1 - horsemen operate earth domain only
Anonymity itself = clue to stealth operation mode
