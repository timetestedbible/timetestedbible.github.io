# Daniel 9:26 — Consonantal Analysis

## The Problem

> "And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah **be cut off**, **but not for himself**: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy **the city and the sanctuary**..." — KJV

This translation reflects the Masoretic vowel pointing — added by Jewish scribes between 600-900 CE, centuries after Daniel wrote and centuries after Christ's life. The original Hebrew text was **consonantal only** — no vowel points, no pronunciation guides.

When we examine the consonantal text, three words in Daniel 9:26 are **ambiguous** — each one capable of a dramatically different reading from what the Masoretes chose. And all three alternative readings point in the same direction.

---

## The Consonantal Text

The second half of Daniel 9:26 in consonantal Hebrew:

**יכרת משיח ואין לו והעיר והקדש ישחית עם נגיד הבא**

The Masoretic pointing produces:

> יִכָּרֵת מָשִׁיחַ וְאֵין לוֹ וְהָעִיר וְהַקֹּדֶשׁ יַשְׁחִית עַם נָגִיד הַבָּא

> "Messiah shall be cut off, and have nothing; and the city and the sanctuary — the people of the coming prince shall destroy..."

But without vowel points, three key words can be read differently.

---

## Ambiguity #1: יכרת — "Be Cut Off" or "Cut a Covenant"?

### Masoretic Reading

**יִכָּרֵת** (yikkarét) — Niphal imperfect 3ms of כָּרַת (H3772)
Meaning: "shall **be cut off**" (passive — something is done TO Messiah)

### Alternative Reading

**יִכְרֹת** (yikhról) — Qal imperfect 3ms of כָּרַת (H3772)
Meaning: "shall **cut**" (active — Messiah does the cutting)

### The Evidence

The consonantal form **יכרת** (yod-kaf-resh-tav) is **identical** for both Niphal and Qal. Only the vowel points distinguish them:

| Form | Pointed | Consonantal | Meaning |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| Niphal impf 3ms | יִכָּרֵת | יכרת | "shall be cut off" |
| Qal impf 3ms | יִכְרֹת | יכרת | "shall cut" |

The Qal imperfect 3ms is attested in Job 41:4:

> "Will he **cut** (הֲ/יִכְרֹת — Qal impf 3ms) a **covenant** (בְּרִית) with thee?" (Job 41:4)

Same consonants. Same person/number/gender. The distinction is purely in the vowel pointing.

### Why "Cut a Covenant" Fits

כָּרַת (H3772) is **THE** standard verb for covenant-making in Hebrew. It appears alongside בְּרִית (covenant, H1285) **78 times** in the Old Testament:

- **Genesis 15:18** — "the LORD **made** (כָּרַת) a **covenant** with Abram"
- **Deuteronomy 5:2** — "the LORD our God **made** (כָּרַת) a **covenant** with us in Horeb"
- **Jeremiah 31:31** — "I will **make** (כָּרַת) a **new covenant** with the house of Israel"

And the **very next verse**, Daniel 9:27, explicitly uses the word covenant:

> "he shall confirm the **covenant** (בְּרִית) with many for one week"

The covenantal meaning of כָּרַת is already the subject of the passage.

### The Physical Connection

In Genesis 15:17, when God "cut" (כָּרַת) the covenant with Abraham, animals were **physically cut in half** and God passed between the pieces. The cutting IS the covenant — the physical act of cutting establishes the agreement. Jesus being "cut" (crucified) IS the covenant-cutting — His body broken, His blood poured out: "this is my blood of the **new covenant**" (Matthew 26:28).

## Ambiguity #2: ואין לו — "Have Nothing" or "Vanish to Himself"?

### Masoretic Reading

**וְאֵין לוֹ** — "and nothing to him" / "and have nothing"
KJV renders this interpretively as "but not for himself"

### Alternative Reading

**וְאֵין לוֹ** — "and he is אַיִן (not/vanished) to himself"

### The Evidence

The word אֵין (H369) is used throughout Scripture for persons who are **divinely removed**:

- **Genesis 5:24** — "Enoch walked with God: and he **was not** (אַיִן); for God **took** him"
- **Genesis 37:30** — "The child **is not** (אַיִן)" — Joseph, alive in glory elsewhere
- **Isaiah 57:1** — "the righteous is **taken away** (אָסַף)... **none** (אַיִן) considering"

When אַיִן is applied to a person in a divine-action context, it means "removed from this realm" — not "ceased to exist." (See the full study: [H369 — The אַיִן Pattern](/reader/words/H369))

The phrase "אֵין לוֹ" — "he is not to himself" — parallels the Enoch pattern: Messiah cuts the covenant and then vanishes, is taken, ascends. From the world's perspective, He "is not." The לוֹ ("to himself") indicates He vanishes *to His own place* — He returns to the Father.

The LXX of Genesis 5:24 rendered Enoch's אַיִן as "**was not found**" — and the NT uses this exact phrase for the **empty tomb**: "they **did not find** the body of the Lord Jesus" (Luke 24:3). The empty tomb IS the Enoch pattern: Messiah was אַיִן — not found — because God took Him.

---

## The והקדש Question — Dual Meaning

### Masoretic Reading

**וְהַקֹּדֶשׁ** (ve-ha-qódesh) — conjunction + article + noun
Meaning: "and the holy place / sanctuary"

### Does It Also Carry a Verbal Meaning?

The consonants **הקדש** can also be read as a verb — the Hiphil of קדש (H6942), meaning "to sanctify/consecrate." This form appears in **Judges 17:3** (הַקְדֵּשׁ — same consonants, read as a verb meaning "to dedicate"). Hebrew consonantal texts often carry **layered meanings** — the ambiguity is a feature of the language, not a defect.

However, the primary alternative reading does **not** depend on reading והקדש as a verb. "The holy place" works perfectly in the alternative translation:

> "Messiah shall cut [a covenant] and vanish — to himself, **and the city, and the holy place**"

All three become אַיִן — Messiah vanishes (ascension), the city vanishes (70 AD destruction of Jerusalem), and the holy place vanishes (70 AD destruction of the temple). This matches history precisely and preserves the natural Hebrew pair "the city and the sanctuary."

The verbal resonance ("and he will sanctify") may be an additional layer packed into the consonants — as is common in Hebrew prophetic literature — but the argument does not rest on it.

---

## The Word-Order Problem: Who Destroys Whom?

### Masoretic / Traditional Reading

The KJV and most translations **rearrange the word order** to produce:

> "the people of the prince that shall come **shall destroy the city and the sanctuary**"

This makes "the people of the prince" the **subject** (the destroyers) and "the city and sanctuary" the **object** (what is destroyed).

### The Actual Hebrew Word Order

The consonantal text reads:

**והעיר והקדש ישחית עם נגיד הבא**

Word by word:

| # | Hebrew | Meaning |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | והעיר | "and the city" |
| 2 | והקדש | "and the holy place" |
| 3 | **ישחית** | **"he will destroy"** (Hiphil impf 3ms) |
| 4 | עם | "people of" |
| 5 | נגיד | "ruler/prince" |
| 6 | הבא | "the coming" |

The verb ישחית (yashchit) is **3rd person masculine singular** — "**he** will destroy," not "**they** will destroy." This is a single actor, not a group.

### Two Readings of the Same Words

**Traditional (rearranged):** "[The city and the sanctuary] — the people of the coming prince shall destroy [them]"
- Subject: the people of the prince
- Object: the city and sanctuary
- Problem: The verb is **singular** ("he will destroy") but the subject is **plural** ("the people")

**Alternative (word order preserved):** "...and the city and the holy place — **he** [Messiah] **will destroy the people of the coming ruler**"
- Subject: Messiah (the "he" who has been the subject throughout — cutting, vanishing)
- Object: the people of the coming ruler
- The singular verb matches a singular subject (Messiah), not a plural one (people)

In the alternative reading, "the city and the holy place" belong to the previous clause (what Messiah vanishes from), and "he will destroy the people of the coming ruler" is the next statement — **Messiah will destroy the antichrist's forces**.

This is not destruction of Jerusalem by an invading army. It is Messiah's ultimate victory over the enemy.

## The Alternative Reading — Full

### Consonantal Text
**יכרת משיח ואין לו והעיר והקדש ישחית עם נגיד הבא**

### Masoretic (KJV basis)
"Messiah shall **be cut off**, and **have nothing**; and **the city and the sanctuary** — the people of the coming prince shall **destroy**..."

Note: The traditional translation **reorders the Hebrew words** to make "the people of the prince" the subject who destroys "the city and the sanctuary." The Hebrew word order does not require this.

### Alternative
"Messiah shall **cut** [a covenant] and **vanish** — to himself and the city and the holy place; **he will destroy the people of the coming ruler**..."

| Word | Consonantal | Masoretic | Alternative |
|------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| יכרת | יכרת | "shall be cut off" (Niphal) | "shall cut [a covenant]" (Qal) |
| משיח | משיח | "Messiah" | "the Anointed One" |
| ואין | ואין | "and nothing" | "and vanish" (Enoch pattern) |
| לו | לו | "to him" | "to himself" (to His own place) |
| והעיר | והעיר | "and the city" | "and the city" (also becomes אַיִן) |
| והקדש | והקדש | "and the holy place" | "and the holy place" (also becomes אַיִן) / possibly also "and he will sanctify" |
| ישחית | ישחית | "shall destroy" (subj: people of prince) | "**he** [Messiah] will destroy" (singular verb, singular subject) |
| עם | עם | "people of" | "the people of" (object, not subject) |
| נגיד הבא | נגידהבא | "the prince that shall come" | "the coming ruler" (the antichrist) |

### What This Describes

In the alternative reading, Daniel 9:26 describes a sequence:

1. **Messiah cuts a covenant** — the crucifixion IS the covenant-cutting (His body broken, His blood poured out as "the blood of the new covenant")
2. **Messiah vanishes (אַיִן) — to Himself, and the city, and the holy place** — the ascension; He returns to the Father. From the world's perspective, He "is not" (the empty tomb, the Enoch pattern). The city and sanctuary also become אַיִן — fulfilled in 70 AD when Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed.
3. **He will destroy the people of the coming ruler** — Messiah will ultimately destroy the antichrist and his forces. The singular verb "he will destroy" (ישחית) matches Messiah as subject, not a plural "people."

This reading connects seamlessly to Daniel 9:27 — and to the Jewish marriage covenant.

## Daniel 9:26-27 and the Marriage Covenant

### Two Verbs, One Covenant

Daniel 9:26 uses **כרת** (karath) — "to cut" a covenant.
Daniel 9:27 uses **גבר** (gabar, H1396, Hiphil: הִגְבִּיר) — "to strengthen/confirm" a covenant.

These are not two different covenants. They are **two stages of one covenant** — and the pattern matches the Jewish marriage precisely.

### The Jewish Marriage Pattern

In ancient Jewish custom, marriage had two distinct stages:

1. **Betrothal (erusin)** — The groom initiates the covenant, often by offering a cup of wine. If the bride accepts the cup, the covenant is sealed. The bride price is paid. They are legally bound, but the marriage is not yet consummated.

2. **The groom departs** — He goes to his father's house to prepare a dwelling place for his bride. The bride waits, not knowing the exact day or hour of his return.

3. **The groom returns** — He comes back, often at night with a shout, to take his bride to the place he has prepared. The marriage is consummated. The covenant is brought to fullness — **strengthened**.

### The Daniel 9:26-27 Sequence

| Stage | Jewish Marriage | Daniel 9:26-27 | Fulfillment |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Cut the covenant** (כרת, v.26) | Groom offers the cup; bride accepts | Messiah cuts a covenant | The Last Supper: "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20) |
| **Vanish** (אַיִן, v.26) | Groom departs to prepare a place | Messiah vanishes to Himself | "I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2); the ascension |
| **The bride waits** | She does not know the day or hour | — | "Of that day and hour knoweth no man" (Matthew 24:36) |
| **Strengthen the covenant** (גבר, v.27) | Groom returns; marriage consummated | He confirms the covenant with many | The marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9) |

Notice: the word in Daniel 9:27 is NOT כרת (cut) again. He does not cut a *new* covenant. He **strengthens** (הִגְבִּיר) the one already cut in v.26. The engagement and the wedding are one covenant, two stages. The cutting is the cross; the strengthening is the return.

### Jesus Used This Exact Pattern

At the Last Supper, Jesus:

1. **Offered the cup** — "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20) — the betrothal proposal
2. **Said He would not drink again** — "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come" (Luke 22:18) — the groom abstains until the wedding feast
3. **Promised to go and return** — "I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again, and receive you unto myself" (John 14:2-3) — the groom departs and promises to return
4. **The word "receive" is παραλαμβάνω (G3880)** — the same word used in Matthew 24:40: "one is **taken**" — the groom taking the bride to himself

Daniel 9:26-27 prophesies this entire sequence: cut the covenant, vanish, strengthen the covenant. The Last Supper was the betrothal. The ascension was the departure. The return will be the wedding.

## Why the Traditional Translation Rearranges the Words

The Masoretic vowel pointing was finalized between 600-900 CE by Jewish scribes who **did not accept Jesus as Messiah**. If the consonantal text of Daniel 9:26 describes Messiah cutting a new covenant, ascending to heaven, and destroying the antichrist — exactly what Christians claim Jesus did and will do — the Masoretes would have had theological motivation to point the text in a way that obscures this reading.

The traditional translation makes three moves that deflect from this christological reading:

1. **Niphal pointing** ("be cut off") — makes Messiah the victim rather than the covenant-maker
2. **Word reordering** — rearranges "he will destroy the people of the coming ruler" into "the people of the coming prince shall destroy [the city]" — reversing who destroys whom
3. **Noun reading of הקדש** — makes it about a building (the sanctuary) rather than leaving open the verbal resonance (sanctify)

This is not to accuse the Masoretes of dishonesty — they were preserving a tradition. But the vowel points are an **interpretation** of the consonantal text, not the text itself. And the word reordering in English translations goes even further — rearranging the Hebrew to fit the Masoretic interpretation. The consonantal text — the text Daniel actually wrote — supports an alternative reading that deserves serious consideration.

## Connection to the אַיִן Pattern

Daniel 9:26 is a key link in the chain traced in the [H369 Pattern Study](/reader/words/H369):

| # | Person | Event | אַיִן Usage |
|---|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Enoch** | God took him | "he was not (אַיִן)" — Gen 5:24 |
| 2 | **Elijah** | Spirit took him up | "found him not" — 2 Kgs 2:17 |
| 3 | **Joseph** | Removed to Egypt | "the child is not (אַיִן)" — Gen 37:30 |
| 4 | **Messiah** | Cut covenant + ascended | "and אַיִן to himself" — Dan 9:26 |
| 5 | **The Righteous** | Gathered from evil | "none (אַיִן) considering" — Isa 57:1 |
| 6 | **Jesus (tomb)** | Risen | "did not find the body" — Luke 24:3 |
| 7 | **Jesus (Emmaus)** | Vanished | "became invisible" — Luke 24:31 |
| 8 | **Philip** | Spirit caught away | "saw him no more" — Acts 8:39 |

The alternative reading of Daniel 9:26 places Messiah's vanishing (אַיִן) directly into this pattern — He cuts the covenant and then does what Enoch did: He "is not," because God takes Him.
