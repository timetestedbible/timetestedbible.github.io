# Daniel 9:24-27 — A Fresh Look at the Hebrew

## The Most Debated Four Verses in Scripture {#introduction}

Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most studied — and most debated — passages in all of Scripture. It contains the famous "70 weeks" prophecy, and entire theological systems have been built on how these four verses are translated.

Yet for all the study, there is remarkably little agreement:

- **When does the 70th week happen?** Some say it was fulfilled at the cross. Others say it's still future — a 2,000+ year "gap" between the 69th and 70th weeks.
- **Who is the "he" in verse 27?** Some say Messiah confirms the covenant. Others say the antichrist makes a treaty. The text doesn't name the subject — interpreters choose.
- **What does "cut off" mean in verse 26?** The KJV adds "but not for himself," which is not in the Hebrew. The NIV says "and will have nothing." Neither is a straightforward translation.
- **Who destroys the city?** Traditional translations rearrange the Hebrew word order to make "the people of the prince" the subject. But the verb is singular ("he will destroy"), not plural.

What if much of this confusion comes not from Daniel, but from **translation choices**?

This study walks through the Hebrew of Daniel 9:24-27 **one word at a time**, with no assumption that you know Hebrew. Every word is shown, transliterated, and explained. The goal is not to tell you what to believe, but to show you what the text actually says — and let you decide.

But first, let's understand why Daniel was asking, and why the traditional answers don't fully satisfy.

---

## The Context: Daniel's Perplexity {#context}

### The Historical Situation

Daniel was taken captive to Babylon around **598 BC** during Nebuchadnezzar's siege. By the time of Daniel 9, it is the **first year of Darius** — approximately **522 BC**. Daniel has been in captivity for roughly **77 years** (inclusive).

He reads Jeremiah's prophecy:

> "I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish **seventy years** in the desolations of Jerusalem." — Daniel 9:2

Daniel is perplexed. He has been counting. Jeremiah promised 70 years — and those 70 years are nearly complete (or already past, depending on the starting point). Yet **Jerusalem is still desolate**. Why?

Historically, there IS a clean 70-year fulfillment: the First Temple was destroyed in **586 BC**, and the Second Temple was completed in the **6th year of Darius** (516 BC) — exactly 70 years. So Jeremiah's prophecy was literally fulfilled in terms of the physical temple.

But Daniel's prayer in chapter 9 goes far beyond bricks and mortar. He confesses the sins of the nation, pleads for restoration, and asks about the **desolation of Jerusalem**. His question isn't just "when will the building be rebuilt?" — it's "when will everything be made right?"

### Gabriel's Answer Goes Further

The angel Gabriel arrives and says:

> "I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding." — Daniel 9:22

What follows (verses 24-27) is **Gabriel's explanation** of what Jeremiah's "70" truly means. This is not a separate prophecy dropped from nowhere — it is an answer to Daniel's question about Jeremiah's timeline.

But notice: Jeremiah said "70 years." Gabriel says "70 sevens." Gabriel is **unpacking** the "70" — revealing that Jeremiah's prophetic "years" are not simple solar years but **sevened periods** whose scope encompasses the full plan of redemption.

The physical temple was rebuilt in 70 years. But the desolation Daniel is grieving over — the transgression, the sin, the broken covenant — requires far more than 70 years to resolve. It requires "70 sevens" — however long that turns out to be.

### Jerusalem: Not Just a City {#jerusalem-symbol}

Daniel prays about "Jerusalem" and "thy holy city." Gabriel's answer is determined upon "thy holy city." But is this only about the physical city in Judea?

Throughout Scripture, Jerusalem carries symbolic weight far beyond its geography — it represents the **covenant community**, the **bride** of God:

- **Galatians 4:26** — "But **Jerusalem which is above** is free, which is the **mother** of us all"
- **Hebrews 12:22-23** — "Ye are come unto **mount Zion**, and unto the **city of the living God**, the **heavenly Jerusalem**... the **general assembly** and church of the firstborn"
- **Revelation 21:2** — "the holy city, **new Jerusalem**, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a **bride** adorned for her husband"
- **Revelation 21:9-10** — The angel says "I will shew thee the **bride**, the Lamb's wife" — and shows John **Jerusalem**

Jerusalem IS the bride. The bride IS the covenant community. When the angel shows John "the bride," he shows him a city made of people, not stones. *(For the full evidence, see the [JERUSALEM Symbol Study](/reader/symbols/JERUSALEM).)*

If "thy holy city" includes the **heavenly Jerusalem** — the bride, the covenant community — then the prophecy's scope extends beyond the physical reconstruction of a city in Judea. It encompasses the full restoration of God's people, culminating in the New Jerusalem descending from heaven (Revelation 21:2).

This is why a purely historical reading (Jerusalem rebuilt in 70 years, done) doesn't satisfy Daniel's question — and why Gabriel's answer reaches so much further.

## The Elephant in the Room: Messiah or Antichrist? {#messiah-or-antichrist}

In the traditional reading of Daniel 9:26-27, there is an unnamed "he" who:
- Confirms (or makes) a covenant
- Causes sacrifices to cease
- Brings desolation

**One camp** says this "he" is the **antichrist** — a future ruler who will make a treaty with Israel, break it halfway through, and desecrate the temple. This requires a "gap" of 2,000+ years between the 69th and 70th weeks — a gap the text never mentions.

**The other camp** says this "he" is **Messiah** — Jesus, who established the new covenant, whose sacrifice ended the need for temple sacrifices, and who predicted Jerusalem's desolation. But if Messiah "is cut off and has nothing," He sounds like a victim, not a king.

Both camps struggle because the traditional translation is genuinely ambiguous about the subject. Entire theological systems — dispensationalism, covenant theology, historicism — have been built on different answers to this single question.

But what if the ambiguity is in the **translation**, not in Daniel? What if the original consonantal Hebrew is far clearer than the English suggests?

To see how that's possible, we need to understand one thing about how Hebrew works.

---

## How Hebrew Words Work {#hebrew-primer}

### The Homonym Problem

In English, the same word can mean completely different things depending on context:

> "I will **present** a **present** in the **present**."

Three meanings — "give" (verb), "gift" (noun), "now" (time) — all from the same spelling. You know which meaning is intended because of context, not because the word itself changes.

Hebrew has this same feature, but more intensely. Hebrew words are built from **consonant roots** (usually three letters), and the same root can produce nouns, verbs, adjectives — all spelled the same way in the original consonantal text.

### Vowel Points: Added Later

When Daniel wrote (around 530 BC), Hebrew was written with **consonants only** — no vowel marks. Readers supplied the vowels from context, just as you supply the meaning of "present" from context.

Between 600-900 AD — over a thousand years after Daniel — Jewish scribes called the **Masoretes** added a system of dots and dashes (vowel points) to the consonantal text. These points are a valuable tradition, but they are an **interpretation**, not the original text. Where the consonants are ambiguous, the Masoretes had to choose one reading — and that choice sometimes obscures other valid readings.

This matters in Daniel 9 because several key words are spelled identically as consonants but mean very different things depending on which vowels you supply. As we walk through the text, we'll see exactly where these ambiguities lie — and how resolving them differently can turn a confusing, debated passage into a coherent prophecy with a clear subject.

## Daniel 9:24 — The Seventy Sevens {#verse-24}

> "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy." — KJV

### The Two Words That Are Really One {#seventy-and-weeks}

Here is something most translations hide completely. The first two words of Daniel 9:24 are:

| Word | Masoretic Pointing | Consonants | Strong's | Meaning |
|------|-------------------|------------|----------|---------|
| 1st | שָׁבֻעִים (*shavu'im*) | **שבעים** | H7620 | "weeks" / "sevened-periods" |
| 2nd | שִׁבְעִים (*shiv'im*) | **שבעים** | H7657 | "seventy" |

Look at the consonants column. **They are identical.** The same four Hebrew letters — שבעים — appear twice in a row. Without vowel points, Daniel 9:24 opens with:

> **שבעים שבעים**

The same word, repeated. The only thing that makes the first one "weeks" and the second one "seventy" is the vowel pointing added over a thousand years later by the Masoretes.

### Why the Repetition Matters {#repetition}

In Hebrew, repeating a word is not redundancy — it is a literary device with specific force:

**It means the thing is divinely established.** Joseph explained this principle to Pharaoh:

> "And for that the dream was **doubled** unto Pharaoh **twice**; it is because the thing is **established by God**, and God will **shortly bring it to pass**." — Genesis 41:32

When God repeats something, it is fixed. It is certain. It will happen. Gabriel opening with שבעים שבעים — the same consonants twice — signals that this timeframe is **divinely decreed and will certainly come to pass**.

**It creates the superlative — the ultimate form:**

- קָדוֹשׁ קָדוֹשׁ קָדוֹשׁ — "Holy, holy, holy" (Isaiah 6:3) = the MOST holy
- שִׁיר הַשִּׁירִים — "Song of Songs" (Song of Solomon 1:1) = the greatest song
- שבעים שבעים — "sevens of sevens" = the **ultimate covenantal timeframe**

**It carries distributive/multiplicative force:**

- יוֹם יוֹם — "day day" = "day by day" / "each day"
- שבעים שבעים — "seventy of seventy" = 70 x 70

So the opening of Daniel 9:24 is not a flat number ("seventy weeks"). The repetition of identical consonants declares: **this is the supreme, divinely established, covenantal timeframe — and God will bring it to pass.**

### "Weeks" Is Spelled Differently Everywhere Else

This gets more striking when you look at how "weeks" (H7620) is spelled in the rest of the Bible:

| Location | Hebrew | Consonants | Plural Ending |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Exodus 34:22 — Feast of Weeks | שָׁבֻע**ֹת** | שבע**ת** | **-ות** (feminine) |
| Deuteronomy 16:9-16 — Feast of Weeks | שָׁבֻע**וֹת** | שבע**ות** | **-ות** (feminine) |
| 2 Chronicles 8:13 — Feast of Weeks | הַשָּׁבֻע**וֹת** | השבע**ות** | **-ות** (feminine) |
| Jeremiah 5:24 — appointed weeks | שְׁבֻע**וֹת** | שבע**ות** | **-ות** (feminine) |
| **Daniel 9:24-26** | שָׁבֻעִ**ים** | שבע**ים** | **-ים** (masculine) |

Every other occurrence of "weeks" in Scripture uses the **feminine plural** ending -וֹת (*-ot*). The Feast of Weeks is always **שָׁבֻעוֹת** (*Shavuot*) — never שָׁבֻעִים.

Every **plural** occurrence of "weeks" outside Daniel uses the **feminine** ending -וֹת (*-ot*). Daniel is the only book that uses the **masculine plural** ending -ים (*-im*). And with that ending, "weeks" becomes **consonantally indistinguishable** from "seventy."

(Note: Leviticus 12:5 also has consonants שבעים, but that is the **dual** form — meaning exactly "two weeks" of uncleanness after bearing a **daughter**. The dual ending -ַיִם looks like -ים in consonants but is a different grammatical form than Daniel's plural.)

The Leviticus connection is symbolically rich: throughout Scripture, Jerusalem and Zion are called "the **daughter**" — "daughter of Zion" (Isaiah 52:2, Zechariah 9:9), "daughter of Jerusalem" (Lamentations 2:15, Zephaniah 3:14). The only non-Daniel use of שבעים for H7620 describes the purification period after bearing a **daughter** — and Daniel's prophecy is about the period determined upon the holy city, which Scripture consistently calls the daughter. For a son, the uncleanness is one שבוע (7 days). For a daughter, it is שבעים — double. The daughter-city undergoes a doubled period of purification, measured in the same word Daniel uses, ending when transgression is finished and she is made clean.

If Daniel meant ordinary "weeks," why use a unique plural form — one that happens to produce the exact same consonants as the word "seventy"?

**Independent witness:** Smith's Literal Translation (SLT) already reads this as **"Seventy seventy"** — not "seventy weeks." This is not a new invention; at least one established English translation saw the same thing in the Hebrew.

### What the Word Actually Means

Strong's defines H7620 not as "week" but as: **"literally, sevened"** — a passive participle from H7650 שָׁבַע (*shava*, "to seven oneself / to swear an oath"). The word literally means "a thing that has been sevened" — a completed seven-cycle.

The **plural** שבעים means "groups of sevens" — not just one seven, but multiple completed seven-cycles bundled together. Since the plural requires at least two, the minimum "group of sevens" is 7 x 7 = 49 — which is a **jubilee cycle**.

### The Feast of Weeks and the Jubilee Pattern

The word שָׁבוּעַ (*shavua*) is the **same word** used for the **Feast of Weeks** — **Shavuot** (שָׁבוּעוֹת). And Shavuot itself is structured as a **miniature jubilee**:

- Count **7 weeks** (49 days) from Firstfruits
- The **50th day** is Shavuot — the day of harvest, of covenant, of the giving of Torah at Sinai

This is the same pattern as the **Jubilee cycle**: count **7 sevens** (49 years), and the **50th year** is the Jubilee — liberty, restoration, return.

So when Gabriel says "שבעים שבעים," the word itself **embeds the jubilee pattern**. "Seventy groups-of-sevens" most naturally reads as **70 jubilee cycles**.

### What "שבעים שבעים" Could Mean

Since the consonants are identical and the word means "groups-of-sevens," Daniel 9:24 opens with a phrase that can mean:

- **"Seventy groups-of-sevens"** — 70 jubilee cycles (70 x 49 = 3,430 years)
- **"Seventy seventy"** — 70 x 70 = 4,900 years
- **"Seventy weeks"** — the traditional reading (70 x 7 = 490) — **but note:** this reading requires the Masoretic vowel points to distinguish the two identical consonantal words as different. It also treats each "sevened" as a simple 7 rather than a "group of sevens" (which is what the plural form means). Of the possible readings, this one relies most heavily on the later vowel pointing.

The ambiguity is not a defect. It is in the consonants Daniel wrote. The Masoretes chose one reading. The consonantal text favors the larger numbers.

### The Math: How Long — and From When? {#the-math}

The calculation depends on two questions: what is a "שבעים" (group-of-sevens), and **when does the count start?**

The starting point is not specified in verse 24 — it says only that the period is "determined upon thy people and thy holy city." The starting point must come from context: the beginning of the covenant community, the giving of the law, the Jordan crossing, or some decree.

Using the dates established in the app's [timeline](/timeline):

| Reading | Calculation | From Abraham's Covenant (1876 BC) | From the Jordan Crossing (1406 BC) |
|---------|-------------|------|------|
| 70 jubilees (70 x 49) | 3,430 years | 1554 AD | 2024 AD |
| 70 x 70 | 4,900 years | 3024 AD | 3494 AD |
| 70 x 7 (Masoretic) | 490 years | 1386 BC | 916 BC |

The 490-year reading, starting from Abraham, ends before David — long before any of the six requirements are fulfilled. Starting from the Jordan crossing, it ends in the divided kingdom. Neither reaches even the Babylonian exile, let alone "everlasting righteousness."

The 70-jubilee reading from the Jordan crossing lands in our generation. The 70 x 70 reading extends through what could be the millennial reign.

The question "when does the count start?" is as important as "how long is each unit?" — and the six items that must be accomplished (see below) constrain the answer. Whatever combination of starting point and unit length you choose, it must reach far enough to contain **all six requirements**.

### Who Are "Thy People"? {#daniels-people}

Gabriel says this prophecy is "determined upon **thy people** and upon **thy holy city**." Most readers assume "thy people" means ethnic Israel during a narrow historical window. But who does Scripture say Daniel's people are?

Daniel's people are the **seed of Abraham** — the covenant community that begins with God's promise:

> "I will make of thee a great nation... and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." — Genesis 12:2-3

> "And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and **thy seed** after thee in their generations for an **everlasting covenant**." — Genesis 17:7

> "In **thy seed** shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." — Genesis 22:18

Paul confirms that this "seed" is ultimately Christ and all who are in Him:

> "Now to Abraham and his **seed** were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy **seed**, which is Christ." — Galatians 3:16

> "And if ye be Christ's, then are ye **Abraham's seed**, and heirs according to the promise." — Galatians 3:29

So "thy people" is not merely ethnic Israel during the Second Temple period. It is the **entire covenant community** — from Abraham's call (Genesis 12) through every generation of his seed, culminating in Christ and all who are grafted in (Romans 11:17-24).

This covenant begins in **1876 BC** with Abraham. If the "seventy sevens" is determined upon this people from their beginning to their completion — when every promise is fulfilled, every transgression finished, everlasting righteousness established — then the timeframe must span from Abraham to the very end.

If "thy people" are the seed of Abraham, and the covenant starts with Abraham, then the 70 x 70 reading (4,900 years from 1876 BC = 3024 AD) naturally spans from the Abrahamic covenant through the millennial reign — the point where "everlasting righteousness" is finally and fully established.

### What Must Be Accomplished {#six-things}

Look at what these "seventy sevens" must accomplish — six things:

1. **Finish the transgression**
2. **Make an end of sins**
3. **Make reconciliation for iniquity**
4. **Bring in everlasting righteousness**
5. **Seal up the vision and prophecy**
6. **Anoint the most Holy**

Ask yourself honestly: **have these been fulfilled?**

Items 1-3 (finish transgression, end sins, reconcile iniquity) — one could argue these were accomplished *positionally* at the cross. But has transgression actually been *finished*? Have sins actually *ended*? Not yet — not in any observable sense.

Items 4-6 are even harder to place in the past:

- **Bring in everlasting righteousness** — Has everlasting righteousness arrived? The world is not yet living in everlasting righteousness. This sounds like it requires the completion of all things — possibly the end of the millennial reign described in Revelation 20.

- **Seal up the vision and prophecy** — Have vision and prophecy been sealed? If Revelation was written after 70 AD (as most scholars hold), prophecy continued well beyond the 490-year window. Sealing up "the vision and prophecy" suggests a point where prophecy is no longer needed — because everything has been fulfilled.

- **Anoint the most Holy** — This could refer to Christ's anointing at His baptism (27 AD). But "the most Holy" (*qodesh qodashim* — literally "holy of holies") could also refer to the anointing of the final, eternal temple — the dwelling place of God with man (Revelation 21:3).

**The test:** If your proposed timeframe cannot contain all six items — if "everlasting righteousness" hasn't been brought in and "the vision and prophecy" hasn't been sealed up — then the "seventy sevens" period isn't finished yet. The 490-year reading (ending around 33 AD) leaves at least three items unfulfilled. Even the 3,430-year jubilee reading pushes into the near future. The 4,900-year reading (70 x 70) extends to encompass the millennial reign and its conclusion.

Whatever the precise calculation, the scope of these six requirements demands a timeframe that reaches to the **very end** — not merely to the cross or to 70 AD.

### Jeremiah's "Years" as Prophetic Units

Remember: Gabriel is explaining Jeremiah's "70 years." Throughout prophetic literature, "days" and "years" function as **abstract units** that stand for larger periods:

- Ezekiel 4:6 — "I have appointed thee each **day for a year**"
- Numbers 14:34 — "each **day for a year**, shall ye bear your iniquities, forty years"

If Jeremiah's "years" are prophetic units — and Gabriel is revealing that each "year" is actually a "seven" (a jubilee cycle) — then the scope of the prophecy expands dramatically. Gabriel isn't correcting Jeremiah; he's **unpacking** what Jeremiah's "70" truly contains.

## Daniel 9:25 — Which Order? Which Jerusalem? {#verse-25}

> "Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times." — KJV

### The Starting Point Question {#which-order}

Most readers assume the count starts "from the going forth of the commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem." But **which commandment?** There are at least four candidates:

| Decree | Date | Issued By | What It Authorized |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Cyrus decree | 539 BC | Cyrus of Persia | Rebuild the temple (Ezra 1:1-3) |
| Artaxerxes to Ezra | 458 BC | Artaxerxes I | Restore worship and law (Ezra 7:11-13) |
| Artaxerxes to Nehemiah | 445 BC | Artaxerxes I | Rebuild the walls (Nehemiah 2:1-8) |
| Suleiman's order | 1535 AD | Sultan Suleiman (Ottoman) | Rebuild Jerusalem's walls and plaza |

Traditional interpretations pick one of the BC decrees and calculate forward. But Daniel 9:25 may describe **two separate counts from two separate decrees** — not one continuous timeline.

### Two Rebuildings Prophesied in Scripture {#two-rebuildings}

Scripture explicitly describes Jerusalem being rebuilt **twice** — and in very different ways:

**The first rebuilding — by Jews alone, rejecting foreign help:**

> "The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but **ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem**." — Nehemiah 2:20

> "They which builded on the wall... every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand **held a weapon**." — Nehemiah 4:17

This is the Ezra/Nehemiah rebuilding: Israelites doing it themselves, armed, in troubled times, explicitly rejecting help from foreigners. Daniel 9:25 describes exactly this: "built again with **plaza and moat**, even in **troublous times**."

**The second rebuilding — by foreigners and their kings:**

> "And the **sons of strangers** shall build up thy walls, and **their kings** shall minister unto thee." — Isaiah 60:10

This was not fulfilled by any of the BC-era rebuildings — Jews built their own walls under Nehemiah. But in **1535 AD**, the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman ordered Jerusalem's walls rebuilt. The walls, gates, and the plaza (the Temple Mount platform as it exists today) were constructed by **foreign workers under a foreign king** — exactly as Isaiah prophesied. A stone plaque commemorating this construction is still visible in Jerusalem today.

### Two Counts in Daniel 9:25 {#two-counts}

The verse gives two numbers separated by a distinct break:

1. **Seven שבעים** — from the decree to restore Jerusalem **until Messiah the Prince**
2. **Sixty-two שבעים** — and it will be rebuilt "with plaza and moat, in troubled times"

The traditional reading collapses these into one continuous count (7 + 62 = 69). But the Hebrew separates them with distinct clauses. They may be **two different periods triggered by two different decrees**:

- **Seven שבעים from a BC decree → Messiah** — whichever unit and starting point places this at Jesus' anointing
- **Sixty שבעים and a second [decree] → Jerusalem rebuilt by foreigners** — the 60th jubilee from the Jordan crossing (1406 BC + 60 x 49 = 1534 AD) lands precisely at Suleiman's order in 1535 AD

If the second rebuilding is by foreigners (Isaiah 60:10), and the 60th jubilee from the Jordan crossing falls in 1534 AD, and Suleiman's order is historically documented at exactly that date — the convergence is striking.

### What This Means for Verse 26

Daniel 9:26 opens with "**and after** the sixty-two [שבעים] **and the second**..." — traditionally read as "after the sixty-two weeks." But if verse 25 established two separate counts, verse 26 is picking up after the **second** count — after the 60th jubilee, after the foreign rebuilding. What follows (Messiah cuts a covenant, vanishes, destroys the enemy) would then be **near-future or end-times events**, not events from 33 AD.

*The detailed chronological calculations are discussed in the [Timeline](/timeline) section. This study focuses on establishing that the text supports two separate decrees and two separate timelines, not one collapsed count.*

---

## Daniel 9:26 — Word by Word {#verse-26}

This is where careful attention to each word matters most. We'll take it one word at a time.

---

### Word 1: "shall cut" {#word-cut}

**Hebrew consonants:** יכרת (*y-k-r-t*)
**Strong's:** H3772 — כָּרַת (*karath*)
**Basic meaning:** to cut

Most translations render this as "**shall be cut off**" — a passive form meaning something is done *to* Messiah. He is the victim.

But the consonants יכרת can equally be read as "**shall cut**" — an active form meaning Messiah *does* the cutting.

How can the same four letters mean both? In Hebrew, the difference between "he will cut" (active) and "he will be cut" (passive) is entirely in the **vowels** — which, remember, were added over a thousand years after Daniel wrote. The consonants are identical.

**Why "cut" matters:** The word כָּרַת (*karath*) is THE standard Hebrew verb for making a covenant. The phrase "cut a covenant" (*karath berit*) appears **78 times** in the Old Testament:

- "The LORD **made** a covenant with Abram" (Genesis 15:18) — literally "cut a covenant"
- "I will **make** a new covenant with the house of Israel" (Jeremiah 31:31) — literally "cut a new covenant"

And the **very next verse** (Daniel 9:27) explicitly discusses "the covenant." The covenantal context is already established.

**The two readings:**

| Reading | Meaning | Messiah's role |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| "shall be cut off" (traditional) | Messiah is killed/removed | Victim |
| "shall cut [a covenant]" (alternative) | Messiah establishes a covenant | Covenant-maker |

Both are linguistically valid. The consonants do not favor one over the other. The question is: which fits the context better?

---

### Word 2: "Messiah" {#word-messiah}

**Hebrew consonants:** משיח (*m-sh-y-ch*)
**Strong's:** H4899 — מָשִׁיחַ (*mashiach*)
**Meaning:** anointed one

This word is the same in both readings. The Anointed One — the Messiah — is the subject of the sentence.

---

### Word 3: "and vanish" {#word-vanish}

**Hebrew consonants:** ואין (*v-'-y-n*)
**Strong's:** H369 — אַיִן (*'ayin*) with the prefix ו (*vav* = "and")
**Basic meaning:** and nothing / and is not / and there is not

The KJV renders the phrase ואין לו as "but not for himself" — which is an interpretation, not a translation. The NIV has "and will have nothing." Neither captures what אַיִן means when applied to a **person**.

Throughout Scripture, when someone is described as אַיִן, it means they are **gone — removed from the scene**:

- **Genesis 5:24** — "Enoch walked with God: and he **was not** (*'ayin*); for God **took** him." Enoch didn't die. He vanished. God removed him.
- **Genesis 37:30** — "The child **is not** (*'ayin*)." Jacob's sons tell him Joseph is gone. But Joseph wasn't dead — he was alive in Egypt, exalted at the right hand of Pharaoh.
- **Isaiah 57:1** — "The righteous perishes, and no man (*'ayin*) lays it to heart... the righteous is **taken away** from the evil to come." The righteous are removed before judgment — and no one notices.

When the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated Enoch's אַיִן, they chose the phrase "**was not found**" — implying someone searched but the person was no longer locatable. The New Testament uses this exact Greek phrase for the **empty tomb**: "they **did not find** the body of the Lord Jesus" (Luke 24:3).

*(For the full pattern of אַיִן applied to persons across Scripture, see the [H369 Pattern Study](/reader/verse-studies/H369).)*

**The two readings:**

| Reading | Meaning | What happens to Messiah |
|---------|---------|------------------------|
| "and will have nothing" (traditional) | Messiah is left with nothing | Defeat, loss |
| "and vanish" (alternative) | Messiah is divinely removed | Ascension — the Enoch pattern |

---

### Word 4: "to himself" {#word-to-himself}

**Hebrew:** לו (*lo*)
**Meaning:** to him / for him / to himself

In the traditional reading, this is part of "have nothing" — "nothing to him."

In the alternative reading, this indicates **where** Messiah vanishes *to*: He returns to Himself, to His own place. Compare John 14:2 — "I go to prepare a place for you."

---

### Words 5-6: "and the city and the holy place" {#word-city-sanctuary}

**Hebrew consonants:** והעיר והקדש (*v-h-'-y-r v-h-q-d-sh*)
**Strong's:** H5892 עִיר (*'ir*, city) and H6944 קֹדֶשׁ (*qodesh*, holy place/sanctuary)

In the traditional reading, "the city and the sanctuary" are the **objects** that get destroyed in the next clause.

In the alternative reading, "the city and the holy place" belong to the **previous** clause — they are part of what becomes אַיִן (vanishes/is gone):

> "Messiah shall cut [a covenant] and vanish — to himself, **and the city, and the holy place**"

All three become אַיִן. Messiah vanishes (the ascension). The city and the holy place also vanish — fulfilled in 70 AD when Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed.

**A possible additional layer:** The consonants הקדש can also be read as a verb meaning "he will sanctify" (attested in Judges 17:3 with these exact consonants). If this verbal resonance is intended, it adds: "and he will sanctify [those taken]." Hebrew prophetic texts often pack multiple meanings into the same consonants. The primary reading ("the holy place") stands on its own; the verbal echo ("sanctify") is a possible enrichment.

### Word 7: "he will destroy" {#word-destroy}

**Hebrew consonants:** ישחית (*y-sh-ch-y-t*)
**Strong's:** H7843 — שָׁחַת (*shachat*), Hiphil imperfect
**Meaning:** he will destroy / he will corrupt

This verb is **3rd person masculine singular** — "**he** will destroy." Not "**they** will destroy."

This is critical. Traditional translations **rearrange the word order** to produce:

> "the people of the prince that shall come **shall destroy** the city and the sanctuary"

But this makes a **plural** subject ("the people") govern a **singular** verb ("he will destroy"). The grammar doesn't naturally fit.

In the alternative reading, the subject of "he will destroy" is the same "he" who has been the subject all along — **Messiah**. He cuts a covenant, He vanishes, and He will destroy the people of the coming ruler.

---

### Words 8-10: "the people of the coming ruler" {#word-people-ruler}

**Hebrew consonants:** עם נגיד הבא (*'-m n-g-y-d h-b-'*)
**Strong's:** H5971 עַם (*'am*, people), H5057 נָגִיד (*nagid*, ruler/prince), H935 בּוֹא (*bo'*, to come)

In the traditional reading, "the people of the prince that shall come" are the **subject** — they do the destroying.

In the alternative reading, they are the **object** — they are what gets destroyed. Messiah destroys the people of the coming ruler. This is not the destruction of Jerusalem by Rome. It is Messiah's ultimate victory over the antichrist's forces.

**The two readings side by side:**

| Traditional (words rearranged) | Alternative (word order preserved) |
|------|------|
| *The people of the prince* shall destroy *the city and sanctuary* | *He* [Messiah] will destroy *the people of the coming ruler* |
| Plural subject, singular verb (grammatical tension) | Singular subject, singular verb (grammatically clean) |
| Rome destroys Jerusalem | Messiah destroys the antichrist |

## Daniel 9:26 — The Two Translations {#verse-26-summary}

### Traditional (KJV)
> "And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah **be cut off**, **but not for himself**: and **the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary**; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined."

### Alternative
> "And after the sixty-two [jubilees] and the second [decree], Messiah **shall cut** [a covenant] **and vanish** — to himself, and the city, and the holy place. **He will destroy the people of the coming ruler**. The end thereof with a flood, and unto the end of the war, desolations are decreed."

## Daniel 9:27 — The Marriage Covenant {#verse-27}

> "And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease..." — KJV

### Two Verbs, One Covenant

Notice that Daniel 9:27 uses a **different verb** for the covenant than 9:26:

- **Verse 26** uses כרת (*karath*, H3772) — "to **cut**" a covenant (initiation)
- **Verse 27** uses גבר (*gabar*, H1396, Hiphil: הִגְבִּיר) — "to **strengthen/confirm**" a covenant (consummation)

He does not cut a *new* covenant in verse 27. He **strengthens** the one already cut in verse 26. These are two stages of one covenant.

### The Jewish Marriage Pattern {#marriage-pattern}

This two-stage covenant matches the ancient Jewish marriage exactly:

**Stage 1 — Betrothal (*erusin*):** The groom initiates the covenant by offering a cup of wine. If the bride accepts, the covenant is sealed. The bride price is paid. They are legally bound, but the marriage is not yet consummated.

**Stage 2 — The groom departs:** He goes to his father's house to prepare a dwelling place. The bride waits. She does not know the exact day or hour of his return.

**Stage 3 — The groom returns:** He comes back — often at night, with a shout — to take his bride to the place he has prepared. The covenant is brought to fullness. The marriage is **strengthened**.

### How Jesus Enacted This Pattern

At the Last Supper, Jesus followed the Jewish betrothal sequence precisely:

1. **He offered the cup** — "This cup is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20). This is the betrothal proposal. The cup of wine is the covenant offer.

2. **He said He would not drink again** — "I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come" (Luke 22:18). The groom abstains until the wedding feast.

3. **He promised to go and return** — "I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again, and receive you unto myself" (John 14:2-3). The groom departs to build the bridal chamber.

4. **He vanished** — The ascension. From the bride's perspective, the groom is אַיִן (gone). She waits.

5. **"No one knows the day or hour"** — (Matthew 24:36). The bride does not know when the groom will return. This is a standard feature of Jewish betrothal — the father decides when the son may go collect his bride.

6. **"One is taken"** — The word "receive" in John 14:3 is παραλαμβάνω (G3880) — the **same Greek word** used in Matthew 24:40: "one is **taken**, and the other left." The groom takes the bride to himself.

### Daniel 9:26-27 Maps to This Sequence

| Stage | Jewish Marriage | Daniel | Fulfillment |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------------|
| **Cut the covenant** | Groom offers the cup | v.26: Messiah cuts a covenant | Last Supper: "This cup is the new covenant" |
| **Vanish** | Groom departs to prepare a place | v.26: Messiah is אַיִן to himself | "I go to prepare a place for you"; the ascension |
| **The bride waits** | She doesn't know the day or hour | — | "Of that day and hour knoweth no man" |
| **Strengthen the covenant** | Groom returns; marriage consummated | v.27: He confirms the covenant with many | The marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:7-9) |

The cutting is the cross. The vanishing is the ascension. The strengthening is the return.

## The Messiah Question — Resolved? {#messiah-resolved}

Recall the debate from the [beginning of this study](#messiah-or-antichrist): is the "he" in Daniel 9:26-27 the Messiah or the antichrist?

In the traditional translation, the ambiguity is genuine — the unnamed "he" could be either. This has fueled centuries of disagreement.

But in the alternative reading, the ambiguity largely disappears:

| Action | Traditional (ambiguous) | Alternative (clear) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Cuts/is cut off | Messiah is cut off (victim) | Messiah cuts a covenant (actor) |
| Vanishes | Has nothing (passive) | Vanishes to Himself (ascension) |
| Destroys | "People of the prince" destroy the city | Messiah destroys the people of the coming ruler |
| Confirms covenant | Ambiguous "he" | Same Messiah — strengthens the covenant He cut |

In the alternative reading, **Messiah is the subject throughout**. He cuts. He vanishes. He destroys. He strengthens. There is no unnamed antichrist figure doing these things. The passage is about Messiah's work from first coming to second coming.

The antichrist appears only as the "coming ruler" (נָגִיד הַבָּא) whose *people* Messiah will destroy — not as the actor in the passage.

## Second Witness: Jeremiah {#jeremiah-witness}

Jeremiah describes the same sequence of events using remarkably similar language:

> "In those days, and in that time... they will ask the way to **Zion**... saying, Come, let us join ourselves to the LORD in a **perpetual covenant** that shall not be forgotten." — Jeremiah 50:4-5

> "**Remove out** of the midst of Babylon... and be as the he goats before the flocks." — Jeremiah 50:8

> "The LORD hath brought forth our **righteousness**: come, and let us declare in **Zion** the work of the LORD our God." — Jeremiah 51:10

> "In those days, and in that time, says the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will **pardon** them whom I reserve." — Jeremiah 50:20

The parallels to Daniel 9:26-27 (alternative reading):
- A **perpetual covenant** (cf. "cut a covenant")
- **Remove out** of Babylon (cf. "vanish" / rapture)
- Brought to **Zion** (cf. "to himself and the city")
- **Pardoned / sanctified** (cf. "he will sanctify")
- Iniquity **not found** (cf. the אַיִן pattern — "not found")

## Summary {#summary}

Daniel 9:26-27, read from the consonantal Hebrew without later vowel point assumptions, describes a coherent sequence:

1. **Messiah cuts a covenant** — the crucifixion as covenant-cutting, sealed at the Last Supper
2. **Messiah vanishes** — to Himself, and the city, and the holy place (ascension + 70 AD)
3. **Messiah will destroy** the people of the coming ruler (final victory)
4. **Messiah strengthens the covenant** — the return, the marriage consummation

This reading resolves the long-standing debate about whether the "he" is Messiah or antichrist. It is Messiah throughout — acting, not acted upon. The covenant is not the antichrist's treaty. It is the new covenant in Messiah's blood, cut at the cross and strengthened at the return.

The traditional translation is not wrong in every detail — but its vowel-point choices and word reordering create ambiguities that the consonantal text does not require. The alternative reading deserves serious consideration alongside the tradition.
