## Why This Study?

This is not a standard symbol study. אַיִן is a negative particle — a function word meaning "there is not" or "does not exist." You cannot substitute a single symbolic meaning into all 657 occurrences. In most uses (~63%), it is mundane negation: "there was no water," "she had no child."

However, Scripture uses אַיִן in a **specific pattern** — when applied to persons in the context of divine action — that carries deep theological significance. This study traces that pattern from Genesis through the New Testament.

**The pattern:** When a person is described as אַיִן ("is not" / "was not" / "gone"), and the context involves God's action, it does not mean the person ceased to exist. It means the person was **removed from this realm by God** — taken, translated, caught away. The world sees them as "not" (gone), but they are alive elsewhere.

This is the biblical vocabulary of what the New Testament calls the "catching away" (1 Thessalonians 4:17).

## Part 1: The Enoch Prototype

### Genesis 5:24 — The Pattern Established

> "And Enoch walked with God: and he **was not** (אֵינֶנּוּ, H369); for God **took** (לָקַח, H3947) him."

This is the foundational verse. The Hebrew does NOT say "he died." It says he "was not" (אַיִן) — and then explains WHY: because God **took** (לָקַח) him. The particle אַיִן describes Enoch's status from the perspective of those left behind. He simply was not there anymore.

### The LXX Translation — A Deliberate Choice

The Septuagint translators (3rd-2nd century BCE) had to render Enoch's אַיִן into Greek. They could have written οὐκ ἦν ("he was not") — a flat existential statement. Instead they chose:

> "And Enoch was well-pleasing to God, and **was not found** (οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο, G2147), because God **translated** (μετέθηκεν, G3346) him."

The choice of "**was not found**" (εὑρίσκω) is interpretive and deliberate. It implies someone *searched* and the person was *not locatable*. He still exists — he just cannot be found by those left behind. This Greek word becomes the bridge into the New Testament.

### Hebrews 11:5 — The NT Confirmation

> "By faith Enoch was **translated** (μετετέθη, G3346) that he should not see death; and **was not found** (οὐχ εὑρέθη, G2147), because God had **translated** (μετέθηκεν, G3346) him."

Hebrews follows the LXX exactly. The word μετατίθημι (G3346) means "to transport, to transfer, to translate." Enoch was physically relocated by God. And from the human perspective: he "was not found."

**The Enoch pattern:**
1. A person walks with God
2. God takes/translates them
3. From the left-behind perspective: the person "is not" (אַיִן) / "was not found" (εὑρίσκω)
4. The person is alive — elsewhere, with God

## Part 2: The Elijah Confirmation

### 2 Kings 2:1-17 — The Same Pattern, Same Words

> "when the LORD would **take up** (H5927) Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind" (2 Kings 2:1)

> "if thou see me **taken** (לֻקָּח, H3947 — same word as Enoch!) from thee... but if **not** (אַיִן, H369)" (2 Kings 2:10)

> "the **Spirit** (רוּחַ, H7307) of the LORD hath **taken him up** (H5375)" (2 Kings 2:16)

> "they sought three days, but **found him not**" (2 Kings 2:17)

The same vocabulary as Enoch:
- H3947 לָקַח (laqach, "took") — used for both Enoch (Gen 5:24) and Elijah (2 Kgs 2:10)
- H369 אַיִן — appears in the Elijah passage (2 Kgs 2:10)
- The search-and-not-found pattern: 50 men searched for 3 days and "found him not"
- The **Spirit** (רוּחַ) is identified as the mechanism of taking (2 Kgs 2:16)

### The LXX of 2 Kings 2 confirms:

> "Dost thou know that the Lord this day is going to **take** thy lord **away** from thy head?" (2 Kgs 2:3,5 LXX)

> "they sought three days, and **found him not**" (2 Kgs 2:17 LXX — same εὑρίσκω as Enoch)

---

## Part 3: The Joseph Type — אַיִן but Alive in Glory

Joseph provides a different angle on the pattern. He is described as אַיִן repeatedly — but he was never dead. He was alive, exalted at the right hand of the ruler, in another realm:

> "Joseph **was not** (אַיִן) in the pit" (Genesis 37:29)

> "The child **is not** (אֵינֶנּוּ, H369)" (Genesis 37:30)

> "the youngest is this day with our father, and one **is not** (אֵינֶנּוּ, H369)" (Genesis 42:13)

> "Joseph **is not** (אֵינֶנּוּ), and Simeon **is not** (אֵינֶנּוּ)" (Genesis 42:36)

His family declared him אַיִן — yet he was alive in Egypt, elevated to the right hand of Pharaoh. He was in a position of glory in another realm, from where he would eventually **reveal himself** and **save his family** from death.

**The Joseph parallel to Christ:**
- Declared אַיִן ("is not") by his own people
- Actually alive and exalted at the right hand of the ruler
- Will reveal himself to those who mourned him
- Will save them from death

## Part 4: The Spirit, the Grass, and the People

### Isaiah 40:6-7 — The Explicit Equation

> "All **flesh** is **grass**, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The **grass** withereth, the flower fadeth: because the **Spirit** (רוּחַ, H7307) **of the LORD bloweth** upon it: surely **the people is grass**."

Scripture explicitly defines: **PEOPLE = GRASS**. And the mechanism of the grass/people withering is the **Spirit (רוּחַ) of the LORD**.

### Psalm 103:15-16 — The Wind, the Grass, and אַיִן

> "As for man, his days are as **grass**: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the **wind** passeth over it, and it is **gone** (אַיִן, H369), and the place thereof shall know it **no more**."

The chain:
- **GRASS = PEOPLE** (Isaiah 40:7 states this explicitly)
- **WIND/SPIRIT (רוּחַ)** passes over the grass/people
- The grass/people become **אַיִן** (gone)
- "The place thereof shall know it no more" — the place they occupied is empty

Now compare with the Elijah event: "the **Spirit** (רוּחַ) of the LORD hath **taken him up**" (2 Kings 2:16). The Spirit/Wind is the mechanism of divine removal in both cases. When the Spirit of the LORD acts on people (grass), they become אַיִן.

The primary meaning of the grass metaphor is human transience — people wither and die. But the **mechanism** is identical to the Elijah taking: the Spirit/Wind (same word רוּחַ) causes a person to become אַיִן (gone). The symbol operates on multiple levels: mortality on the surface, divine taking at the deeper level.

## Part 5: Isaiah 57:1 — The Righteous Gathered Before Judgment

> "The righteous perisheth, and **no man** (אַיִן, H369) layeth it to heart: and merciful men are **taken away** (H622 אָסַף = gathered), **none** (אַיִן, H369) considering that the righteous is **taken away** (H622) **from the evil to come**."

This is arguably the strongest single verse for the divine-removal pattern:

1. The righteous are **gathered away** (אָסַף, H622) from coming evil
2. **No one** (אַיִן) **notices** — the world is unaware
3. **No one** (אַיִן) **understands** what happened
4. The purpose: to remove them **from the evil to come**

The word אַיִן appears twice — describing both the *event* (the righteous are removed) and the *world's blindness* to it.

Verse 2 continues: "He shall enter into **peace**: they shall **rest** in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness."

---

## Part 6: Jeremiah 31:15-17 — They "Are Not" but Will Return

> "Rachel weeping for her children... because they **were not** (אֵינֶנּוּ, H369)." (Jeremiah 31:15)

> "Refrain thy voice from weeping... they shall **come again** from the land of the enemy." (Jeremiah 31:16)

> "There is hope in thine end... thy children shall **come again** to their own border." (Jeremiah 31:17)

Rachel's children are declared אַיִן — yet God promises they will **return**. They are not permanently destroyed. They have been removed, and they will come back.

---

## Part 7: The Dual אַיִן — Righteous vs. Wicked

The same word describes two opposite destinies:

### The Righteous אַיִן — Taken BY God

| Verse | Text |
|-------|------|
| Genesis 5:24 | Enoch "was not (אַיִן); for God **took** him" |
| 2 Kings 2:10-17 | Elijah — Spirit **took him up**, "found him not" |
| Genesis 37-42 | Joseph "is not (אַיִן)" — alive in glory at the right hand |
| Isaiah 57:1 | The righteous "**taken away** from the evil to come" |
| Jeremiah 31:15-17 | "Are not (אַיִן)" but will "**come again**" |

### The Wicked אַיִן — Destroyed by God

| Verse | Text |
|-------|------|
| Psalm 37:10 | "Yet a little while, and the wicked **shall not be** (אַיִן)" |
| Psalm 37:36 | "He passed away, and, lo, **he was not** (אַיִן)" |
| Psalm 104:35 | "Let the sinners be consumed... let the wicked be **no more** (אַיִן)" |
| Proverbs 10:25 | "As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked **no more** (אַיִן)" |
| Proverbs 12:7 | "The wicked are overthrown, and **are not** (אַיִן)" |
| Job 8:22 | "The dwelling of the wicked shall **come to nought** (אַיִן)" |
| Ezekiel 28:19 | "Thou shalt be a terror, and **never** shalt thou be **any more** (אַיִן)" |

**From the outside, both look the same** — the person "is not." But the cause, destination, and permanence are opposite:

| | Righteous אַיִן | Wicked אַיִן |
|---|---|---|
| **Cause** | God takes them | God destroys them |
| **Destination** | With God / in glory | Permanent non-existence |
| **Reversible?** | Yes — they return / are revealed | No — permanent |
| **World's perception** | "They are not" | "They are not" |

### The Whirlwind Detail

Proverbs 10:25 — "As the **whirlwind** passeth, so is the wicked **no more** (אַיִן): but the righteous is an everlasting foundation."

The whirlwind makes the wicked אַיִן (destroyed). But the whirlwind is the very vehicle that takes Elijah to heaven (2 Kings 2:1-11) — making him אַיִן in the *positive* sense. Same mechanism, opposite outcomes.

---

## Part 8: The LXX Bridge — "Not Found" in the New Testament

The LXX's rendering of Enoch's אַיִן as "was not found" (εὑρίσκω, G2147) creates a keyword that runs through the NT:

### Righteous "Not Found" — Divine Removal

| Verse | Event | Text |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Hebrews 11:5** | Enoch | "**was not found** (G2147), because God had translated him" |
| **Luke 24:3** | Empty tomb | "they **did not find** (G2147) the body of the Lord Jesus" |
| **Luke 24:23** | Empty tomb | "**not having found** (G2147) the body of Him" |
| **Luke 2:45** | Boy Jesus | "**not having found** (G2147) Him, they returned to Jerusalem" |
| **Acts 5:22** | Apostles freed | "the officers **did not find** (G2147) them in the prison" |
| **John 7:34-36** | Jesus foretells | "You will seek Me and **not find** (G2147) Me" |

The **empty tomb** uses the exact same Greek word as Enoch's אַיִן. The women come searching and Jesus is "not found" — because, like Enoch, God translated Him. The explanation parallels Enoch: "He is not here; He is risen" = "he was not found; God translated him."

### Wicked/Babylon "Not Found" — Destruction

| Verse | Event | Text |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Revelation 18:21-22** | Babylon | "shall **not be found** (G2147) any more" |
| **Revelation 20:11** | Final judgment | "place **not was found** (G2147) for them" |
| **Revelation 20:15** | Book of life | "if anyone **not was found** (G2147) in the book of life" |

The same "not found" language — but for destruction, not translation.

---

## Part 9: Explicit NT Vanishing Events

The NT records multiple events where persons become invisible or are relocated by divine action — the experiential reality of אַיִן:

### Luke 24:31 — Jesus Became Invisible

> "He **vanished** (ἄφαντος, G855 — literally 'became un-apparent/invisible') from them."

The only NT use of ἄφαντος. Jesus did not walk away. He became imperceptible — the experiential reality of אַיִן from the observer's perspective.

### Acts 8:39-40 — Philip Caught Away

> "the **Spirit** (πνεῦμα, G4151) of the Lord **caught away** (ἁρπάζω, G726) Philip, that the eunuch **saw him no more**"

> "Philip **was found** (εὑρέθη, G2147) at Azotus"

Philip is explicitly taken by the Spirit (same mechanism as Elijah) and the eunuch "saw him no more" (the left-behind perspective = אַיִן). Then Philip "was found" at Azotus — relocated, not destroyed. The word ἁρπάζω (G726) here is the same word used for the rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.

### Luke 4:30 — Jesus Through the Crowd

> "He, having passed through the midst of them, went away."

A mob intends to throw Him off a cliff. He simply moves through them unseen and departs.

### John 20:19-26 — Through Shut Doors

> "the doors having been shut... came Jesus and stood in the midst"

The reverse of vanishing — He appears where there is no physical entry.

### John 6:21 — The Boat Teleportation

> "immediately the ship was at the land whither they went"

Corporate teleportation — the entire boat with disciples is instantly relocated.

### Acts 1:9-11 — The Ascension

> "He was **taken up** (G1869), and a **cloud** hid Him from their eyes"

> "This Jesus, having been **taken up** (G353) from you into heaven, shall **so come** in like manner"

The cloud conceals. He becomes אַיִן to those on earth. And the promise: He will return the same way.

## Part 10: The OT-to-NT Vocabulary Map

| OT Hebrew | NT Greek | Meaning | Key Verses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **אַיִן (H369)** "is not / gone" | **ἄφαντος (G855)** "invisible/vanished" | Person ceases to be perceived | Gen 5:24, Luke 24:31 |
| **לָקַח (H3947)** "took" | **ἁρπάζω (G726)** "caught away/seized" | God seizes/takes the person | Gen 5:24, Acts 8:39, 1 Thess 4:17 |
| **נָשָׂא (H5375)** "lifted up" | **ἐπαίρω (G1869)** / **ἀναλαμβάνω (G353)** "taken up" | Physically raised/removed | 2 Kings 2:16, Acts 1:9-11 |
| **אָסַף (H622)** "gathered away" | **παραλαμβάνω (G3880)** "taken alongside/received" | Collected/received by God | Isa 57:1, Matt 24:40, **John 14:3** |
| **רוּחַ (H7307)** "Spirit/Wind" | **πνεῦμα (G4151)** "Spirit" / **νεφέλη (G3507)** "cloud" | The divine mechanism of taking | Isa 40:7, 2 Kgs 2:16, Acts 8:39, 1 Thess 4:17 |
| "found him not" (2 Kgs 2:17) | **οὐχ εὑρίσκω (G2147)** "was not found" | The search perspective of the left-behind | Heb 11:5, Luke 24:3 |

### John 14:3 — The Promise

> "I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go... I am coming again and will **receive you to Myself** (παραλαμβάνω, G3880), that where I am, you also may be."

This is the **same Greek word** used in Matthew 24:40-41 — "one is **taken** (παραλαμβάνω), one is left." Jesus promises to do exactly what was done to Enoch and Elijah — to take them to Himself. From the perspective of those left behind, the taken ones simply "are not" (אַיִן).

---

## Part 11: Daniel 9:26 — The Consonantal Connection

> "And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself" (KJV)

The Hebrew word אֵין (H369) appears in this verse. The Masoretic text reads: "Messiah shall be cut off (יִכָּרֵת) and have nothing (וְאֵין לוֹ)." But the consonantal text (without vowel points added by the Masoretes in 600-900 CE) is ambiguous in three places. See the companion study: **[Daniel 9 — The Seventy Sevens](/reader/words/DANIEL-9)** for the full argument that this verse may describe Messiah cutting a covenant and vanishing (the Enoch pattern), rather than being cut off and having nothing.

---

## Summary: The אַיִן Pattern

H369 אַיִן is not a symbol with a single substitutable meaning. It is a **pattern marker** — a word that, in the specific configuration of *person + divine action*, signals that someone has been divinely removed from this realm.

The pattern:
1. **Established** by Enoch (Gen 5:24) — "he was not; for God took him"
2. **Confirmed** by Elijah (2 Kgs 2) — Spirit took him; found him not
3. **Typified** by Joseph (Gen 37-42) — "is not" but alive in glory
4. **Symbolized** by grass and wind (Isa 40:7, Ps 103:16) — Spirit/Wind passes over people, they become אַיִן
5. **Prophesied** in Isaiah 57:1 — righteous gathered away from evil, no one notices
6. **Bridged** by the LXX — "was not found" (εὑρίσκω) becomes the keyword
7. **Fulfilled** in Christ — the empty tomb ("did not find the body"), the ascension, the vanishings
8. **Enacted** in Acts — Philip caught away by the Spirit, Paul caught to third heaven
9. **Promised** for the future — "one is taken (παραλαμβάνω), one is left" (Matt 24:40); "caught away (ἁρπάζω) in the clouds" (1 Thess 4:17)

The world says they "are not." But they are with God.
