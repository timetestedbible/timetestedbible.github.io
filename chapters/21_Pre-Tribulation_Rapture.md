# Before Her Pain Came

Many people have different understandings of the timing of the gathering, with honest seekers arriving at pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, pre-wrath, and post-tribulation conclusions. The disagreement stems from reading prophetic discourse as a chronological timeline rather than recognizing the Hebrew literary structures and symbol connections that govern how the text is organized.

This study builds an argument entirely from precondition and postcondition chains — the "TILL," "WHEN," "THEN," "BEFORE," and "CANNOT...UNTIL" language that locks one event behind another. The conclusion is not assumed; it emerges from tracing the connections.

## The Two Births of Isaiah 66

> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child. Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.
> — Isaiah 66:7-9

Two deliveries. Not one.

Verse 7 uses two different Hebrew verbs for what happens to the man child:

- **H3205 yalad** — "brought forth" (birth)
- **H4422 malat** — "was delivered" (escape, slip away)

That second word, *malat*, appears four times in the story of Lot's extraction from Sodom:

> Escape (malat) for thy life... I cannot escape (malat) to the mountain... let me escape (malat) thither... Escape (malat) thither; for **I cannot do anything till thou be come thither.**
> — Genesis 19:17-22

Isaiah chose the Sodom-escape word for the man child's delivery. This is extraction language, not generic birth language.

The text describes two stages with two different products, two different timings, and two different mechanisms:

| | Verse 7 — Before Pain | Verse 8 — Through Pain |
|---|---|---|
| **Timing** | BEFORE travail | AS SOON AS Zion travailed |
| **Product** | Man child (singular) | Children (plural) |
| **Nature** | Miraculous ("who hath heard such a thing?") | Expected (labor produces offspring) |
| **Mechanism** | Escape/extraction (malat) | Birth through process (yalad) |

Verse 9 confirms God is the actor in both: "Shall **I** bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?"


## Who Is the Man Child?

> And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.
> — Revelation 12:5

The man child is not Jesus individually. Jesus was born during Roman suffering — not "before her pain came." And Isaiah 66:8 explicitly defines the man child as a nation: "shall a **nation** be born at once?"

The overcomers receive the same authority as the man child:

> And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: And he shall rule them with a rod of iron.
> — Revelation 2:26-27

Rod of iron. Power over nations. The same language as Revelation 12:5 and Psalm 2:9. The man child is the covenant nation — the overcomers — and Revelation 12:5 says this company is **caught up** (G726 harpazo, the same word as 1 Thessalonians 4:17) to God's throne.

### The Woman, the Child, and the Remnant

The woman of Revelation 12 is not the same group as the man child. The child comes **out of** the woman. The woman IS the mother — Israel/Zion — identified by Genesis 37:9-10's imagery: sun (Jacob), moon (Rachel), twelve stars (twelve tribes).

> And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.
> — Revelation 12:1

Revelation 12 presents three distinct groups from this mother:

- **Rev 12:5** — The **man child** is caught up to God's throne (BEFORE the dragon acts) = the overcomers, delivered before pain
- **Rev 12:6** — The **woman herself** flees to the wilderness for 1,260 days = Israel, who repents under judgment and flees when the abomination is installed
- **Rev 12:17** — The **remnant of her seed** = those who "keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus" = believers who come to faith during the tribulation and face the dragon's war

The child is not the mother. The child comes out and is caught up. The mother remains, and when judgment strikes, she repents and flees. The remnant of her seed are those who emerge during the tribulation period itself.

This maps precisely onto Isaiah 66:7-8: the man child is delivered before pain (v7). Then the mother travails, and through the travail her children are born (v8) — "shall a nation be born at once?" The judgment itself causes Israel to repent and become the nation born in a day.

### The Two 1,260-Day Periods

The timeline is not a single 1,260-day period but two halves of a seven-year span:

**First 1,260 days — Testimony:**
- Two witnesses prophesy in sackcloth (Rev 11:3)
- Gospel preached to all nations for a witness (Mat 24:14)
- Witnesses protected — beast cannot act until they finish (Rev 11:7)

**Midpoint — The Hinge:**
- Witnesses finish testimony (Rev 11:7 "when they shall have finished")
- Beast kills the witnesses (Rev 11:7-10)
- Abomination installed (Mat 24:15 / 2Th 2:3-4)
- "When ye see... THEN flee" (Mat 24:15-16)

**Second 1,260 days — Woman in Wilderness:**
- Woman flees to wilderness where she is nourished (Rev 12:6,14)
- Beast exercises authority 42 months (Rev 13:5)
- Holy city trodden by Gentiles 42 months (Rev 11:2)
- No faithful Israelites remain in the land — all have fled

The total: approximately seven prophetic years, split at the midpoint by the abomination. Daniel 9:27's "midst of the week" marks this hinge — sacrifice ceases, the counterfeit is installed, and the woman flees.

### The Dragon's Flood = Daniel 9's Flood

When the woman flees, the dragon pursues:

> And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood (G4215 potamos) after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood.
> — Revelation 12:15-16

Water = nations and peoples (Revelation 17:15). The "flood" from the dragon's mouth is an army — nations sent to pursue and destroy the fleeing woman. The earth swallows this army, protecting Israel in the wilderness.

Now connect this to Daniel 9:26: "the end thereof shall be with a **flood** (H7858 sheteph)." The same concept — an overwhelming military force. Daniel 9:26's "flood" and Revelation 12:15's "flood" describe the same event: the beast-system sending armies after the covenant people who have fled.

The dragon cannot destroy the woman directly. He spews nations after her. Then:

> And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood.
> — Revelation 12:16

The earth opening its mouth = an **earthquake**. The pursuing army is swallowed by seismic upheaval — the same pattern as Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16:32: "the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up"). This earthquake may be the same event as Revelation 11:13: "the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand" — which occurs at the moment the witnesses rise from their 3.5-day death.

The timeline matters. The earthquake swallows the dragon's army. The dragon **gives up** pursuing the woman — she is now beyond his reach in the wilderness. Frustrated, he turns to the only targets he can still reach:

> And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
> — Revelation 12:17

The earthquake ends the dragon's direct pursuit of Israel. After his army is swallowed, he cannot reach the woman, so he redirects his war to the remaining believers — the "remnant of her seed" who are still within Babylon's reach. This is why Revelation 13 follows immediately with the beast exercising 42-month authority and making war with the saints (Rev 13:7).

### Mountains: Literal, Symbolic, and Literal Again

The command to "flee to the mountains" operates at different scales in different eras, because history is enacted parable — literal events walk out symbolic truth simultaneously.

**70 AD — Mountains = Nations (symbolic):**

> When ye shall see the abomination of desolation... then let them which be in Judaea flee to the mountains.
> — Matthew 24:15-16

The mountain study establishes: mountain = kingdom/ruling authority (Daniel 2:35, Revelation 17:9). In 70 AD, Christians literally fled Jerusalem and scattered among the **nations**. Luke 21:24 confirms: "led away captive into **all nations**." Acts 8:1,4 shows the earlier pattern: "scattered abroad... went every where preaching." The flight to the "mountains" was fulfilled as flight to the kingdoms/nations of the world — and the scattering itself became the mechanism of the gospel reaching all nations (Matthew 24:14).

**Lot — Mountains = Literal:**

> Escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
> — Genesis 19:17

Lot literally fled to the physical mountains above Zoar. The prototype operates at the most concrete level — feet on rock, climbing upward, away from the burning plain below.

**At the Return — Mountains = Literal again:**

> And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives.
> — Zechariah 14:4

> In the last days... the mountain of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the mountains... and people shall flow unto it.
> — Micah 4:1

> The great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish... and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.
> — Isaiah 27:13

The pattern inverts. The scattering sent God's people TO the nations (symbolic mountains). The gathering brings them FROM the nations to the **literal** Mountain — Mount Zion, Jerusalem, the physical mountain where God's feet will stand. The scatter was symbolic; the regathering is concrete. The nations served as the temporary wilderness-shelter; the Mountain is the permanent destination.

This is why the apantesis (G529, 1 Thessalonians 4:17) is a civic escort **toward** earth: the gathered elect are not departing from the planet but converging on the Mountain — the kingdom established "in the top of the mountains" where "all nations shall flow unto it" (Micah 4:1-2).


## Five Witnesses to the Vanishing

The man child's extraction before pain is not an isolated verse. Five independent texts describe the same event using different vocabulary:

### 1. Isaiah 66:7 — Delivered Before Pain

> Before her pain (H2256 chebel = birth pang) came, she was delivered (H4422 malat = escape) of a man child.

The birth pangs of Matthew 24:4-8 use the same concept (G5604 odin = birth pang). The man child escapes before the birth pangs begin.

### 2. Revelation 12:5 — Caught Up to Throne

> Her child was caught up (G726 harpazo) unto God, and to his throne.

The same G726 harpazo used in 1 Thessalonians 4:17: "caught up together with them in the clouds." The man child is harpazo'd to God's throne before the dragon can act, before the 1,260-day tribulation of verse 6.

### 3. Daniel 9:26 — Messiah Cuts and Vanishes

The standard translation reads "Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself." But the Hebrew tells a different story.

The consonantal **כרת** (karath) is the standard covenant-making verb — the word used to CUT covenants (Genesis 15:18: "the LORD **karath** a covenant with Abram"). And **H369 ayin** means "is not" — the word used for Enoch's departure:

> Enoch walked with God: and he was not (H369 ayin); for God took him.
> — Genesis 5:24

With these meanings restored, Daniel 9:26 reads: "Messiah **cuts** (a covenant) and **vanishes** — to himself." The same vanishing as Enoch. God takes him. And the singular verb that follows — "**he** will destroy the people of the coming ruler" — points to God as the agent of destruction, not the people destroying the city.

The sequence: Messiah cuts the covenant. Messiah vanishes. God destroys the wicked.

### 4. 2 Thessalonians 2:7 — The Restrainer Removed

> He who now letteth (G2722 katecho = restrains) will let, until he be taken out of the way. And THEN shall that Wicked be revealed.

Something restrains the wickedness from being visible. That restrainer is removed. And THEN — after the removal — the wicked one is uncovered.

### 5. Genesis 5:24 — The Enoch Prototype

> Enoch walked with God: and he was not (H369 ayin); for God took him.

Enoch didn't die. He vanished. God took him. And the flood came after him — not before. He is the first prototype of pre-judgment extraction.

Five texts. Five vocabularies. One event: the righteous vanish, and then judgment falls.

| Text | Word | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Isaiah 66:7 | H4422 malat | Escape (Lot's Sodom word) |
| Revelation 12:5 | G726 harpazo | Caught up / forcefully seized |
| Daniel 9:26 | H369 ayin | Vanish ("was not") |
| 2 Thessalonians 2:7 | "taken out of the way" | Restrainer removed |
| Genesis 5:24 | H369 ayin | Vanish ("was not, for God took him") |


## The Restrainer: Why the Righteous Must Leave First

### The Sodom Principle

Abraham negotiated with God over Sodom's fate: fifty righteous? God will spare. Forty-five? Spare. Forty, thirty, twenty, ten? God agreed at every threshold. The constraint was never God's willingness — it was the absence of righteous persons.

> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
> — Genesis 18:25

There weren't even ten righteous in Sodom. So individual extraction replaced corporate preservation. And the angel gave Lot the governing principle of all end-time prophecy:

> Haste thee, escape thither; for **I cannot do anything till thou be come thither.**
> — Genesis 19:22

Judgment is structurally locked behind extraction. God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked. The righteous must be out before fire falls.

### Every Prototype Confirms It

| Prototype | Extraction | Then Judgment |
|---|---|---|
| Enoch vanishes (Gen 5:24) | Then flood (Gen 6-7) |
| Noah sealed in ark (Gen 7:1,16) | Then waters close |
| Blood on doorposts (Exod 12:7) | Then destroyer passes |
| Lot extracted from Sodom (Gen 19:16) | Then fire from heaven |
| Rahab extracted from Jericho (Josh 6:22-23) | Then city burned with fire |
| Israel crosses Red Sea (Exod 14:29) | Then waters close on Egypt |

Zero counter-examples. The extraction-before-judgment pattern has no exceptions in all of Scripture.

### The Righteous Presence IS the Restraint

If righteous people in a city restrain God's judgment (Genesis 18), and judgment cannot fall until they leave (Genesis 19:22), then the presence of the righteous is the restraining force.

Revelation 7:1-3 applies this principle directly:

> Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, **till** (G891 achri) we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.
> — Revelation 7:3

The four winds — which are the four horsemen, which are the four executing spirits of Zechariah 6:5 — are already dispatched but **restrained**. They cannot ride until the servants are secured.

And 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7 names this restraint explicitly:

> Ye know what withholdeth (G2722 katecho = restrains)... he who now letteth will let, **until he be taken out of the way.** And then shall that Wicked be revealed.

The restrainer is removed. Then the wicked is revealed. Then judgment rides. The same sequence as Genesis 18-19: righteous presence restrains judgment — righteous removed — judgment falls.


## The Wicked Revealed by Absence

The Greek word for "revealed" in 2 Thessalonians 2:8 is G601 **apokalypto** — "to uncover, unveil." The same word used for Christ's revelation. The apocalypse = the unveiling.

The man-of-sin study shows this is not just one individual:

> Many antichrists... even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.
> — 1 John 2:18

The "mystery of iniquity **already works**" (2 Thessalonians 2:7). The wickedness is already present — mixed in, hidden among the righteous like tares among wheat.

When the righteous are removed, the wickedness that was concealed becomes visible. There's no more contrast. No more light to expose. No more wheat obscuring the tares. What remains is the wicked — and their wickedness is now **uncovered**. They are "revealed" not because they step forward but because the righteous stepped out.

The departure of the righteous IS the revelation of the wicked — by absence.


## Tribulation Is Not Wrath

This distinction is critical. Two Greek words describe two different experiences:

**G2347 thlipsis** (tribulation/pressure) — Saints HAVE this:

> In the world ye shall have thlipsis.
> — John 16:33

> These are they which came out of great thlipsis.
> — Revelation 7:14

**G3709 orgé** (wrath/judicial sentence) — Saints do NOT have this:

> God hath **NOT appointed** us to orgé, but to obtain salvation.
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:9

> Jesus which **delivered** us from the orgé to come.
> — 1 Thessalonians 1:10

> Justified by blood — **saved from** orgé through him.
> — Romans 5:9

Tribulation **refines** covenant-keepers. Wrath **destroys** covenant-breakers. Same fire, different material.

### The Fall of Babylon IS God's Wrath

This is not ambiguous. Revelation uses both wrath words for Babylon's fall:

> Great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the **fierceness** (G2372 thymos) of his **wrath** (G3709 orge).
> — Revelation 16:19

The seven bowls ARE the wrath. The seventh bowl IS Babylon's fall. Saints are not appointed to wrath. Therefore saints are not present when Babylon falls. The extraction-before-fire pattern is not optional — it is the mechanism by which God keeps His promise.


## The Four Horsemen: God's Instrument of Destruction

> These are the four spirits (H7307 ruach) of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
> — Zechariah 6:5

The angel explicitly decodes the four horses and chariots: they are God's four executing spirits. They bring deception, war, famine, and death — the birth pains of Matthew 24:4-8, the seal judgments of Revelation 6:1-8.

They are the spiritual force that dismantles Babylon. And they are restrained until the righteous are protected:

> Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, **till** we have sealed the servants of our God.
> — Revelation 7:3

The four winds cannot ride while God's people are unprotected — for the same reason fire could not fall while Lot was inside Sodom.

And the elect are ultimately gathered **from** these four winds:

> He shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect **from the four winds.**
> — Matthew 24:31

The four winds = the four horsemen = the four spirits. The elect are gathered from the domain where these destroying forces have been operating — from Babylon's collapse zone. They are gathered out of the territory the horsemen have been riding through.


## Matthew 24 Is a Ring, Not a Timeline

The Olivet Discourse is commonly read as a chronological sequence from verse 4 to verse 51. But it is structured as a Hebrew literary inclusio — opening and closing with the main event, with elaboration in the middle.

### The Structure

```
A  — v3:        The QUESTION — "What is the sign of thy coming?"

  B  — vv4-14:    What the world looks like after — birth pains,
                   persecution, testimony, "then the end"

    C — vv15-28:   The crisis — abomination, flight, great distress,
                   false Christs

  B' — vv29-31:   The CLIMAX — darkening, Son of Man appears,
                   trumpet, gathering of remaining elect

A' — vv32-51:   The MAIN EVENT REVISITED — Days of Noah,
                   one taken/one left, thief, faithful servant
```

**A and A'** both describe the sudden, unexpected separation during ordinary life — the vanishing. **B and B'** describe the aftermath: what happens to the world between the vanishing and the climactic return.

### The Evidence

**The Days of Noah describe normalcy, not tribulation.** "Eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage" (v38) is not a description of wars, famine, and pestilence (vv4-8). It is peace and safety — 1 Thessalonians 5:3's exact condition. Luke 17:28 adds six activities for Lot's era: eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building — a complete economic cycle at full operation. This is Babylon at its peak, not Babylon collapsing.

**Two different gathering vocabularies.** Verse 31 uses G1996 **episunago** (gather together) — angels sent with a trumpet after cosmic signs. Verses 40-41 use G3880 **paralambano** (receive alongside) — the same word Jesus used in John 14:3: "I will come again and **receive** (paralambano) you unto myself." Two different Greek words. Two different settings. Two different events.

**"No man knows the day or hour" applies to the vanishing.** The return (vv29-31) has identifiable preconditions: cosmic darkening, Babylon's smoke, the trumpet. You can see those coming — that's the whole point of the fig-tree parable ("when you see these things, know that it is near"). But the initial vanishing has no preceding signs. It happens during normalcy, as a thief in the night.

**The thief comes during sleep.** The householder doesn't know the watch (v43). The thief operates during peace and darkness. But vv29-31 happen after visible cosmic disruption — that's the opposite of a thief. The thief imagery fits the initial vanishing, not the climactic return.

The discourse doesn't proceed chronologically from v4 to v51. It states the main event (v3 question), elaborates on what follows (vv4-28), reaches the climax (vv29-31), and circles back to the main event with application (vv32-51).


## Revelation Is Parallel, Not Sequential

A critical structural point: the seals, trumpets, and bowls in Revelation are not three sequential series stacked end-to-end. They are three **perspectives** on the same period — and the 7th of each converges on a single event.

| 7th Seal (Rev 8:1,5) | 7th Trumpet (Rev 11:15,19) | 7th Bowl (Rev 16:17-19) |
|---|---|---|
| Silence → fire cast to earth | "Kingdoms become our Lord's" | "It is done" |
| Voices, thunderings, earthquake | Temple opened, lightning, earthquake | Greatest earthquake ever |
| — | "Destroy them which destroy the earth" | "Great Babylon came in remembrance" |

Three 7th-events. One pattern: **the transfer of sovereignty from Babylon to God's kingdom.** The 7th trumpet declares the kingdom. The 7th bowl triggers Babylon's fall. They are the same moment.

This means the kingdom is not declared at the end of a long sequence after Babylon has already burned. The kingdom is declared **at the taking of Babylon** — the fall itself IS the kingdom transfer. When the system collapses, the authority shifts. Simultaneously. Joshua 6:16 at Jericho: "Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city" — the shout and the taking are one event.

The seals reveal the period from heaven's perspective (the scroll opened). The trumpets announce it from the witness perspective (warnings and declarations). The bowls pour it from the judgment perspective (wrath executed). All three are looking at the same events from different angles, converging at the 7th on a single moment: Babylon falls, the kingdom transfers, "it is done."


## The Cosmic Signs Are Babylon's Smoke

The source text for Matthew 24:29 — "the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light" — is Isaiah 13:10. And Isaiah 13:1 opens with: "**The burden of Babylon.**"

The cosmic signs are not a separate astronomical event. They are caused by the smoke of Babylon's burning:

> And the smoke of her burning... the sun and the air were darkened **by reason of** the smoke.
> — Revelation 18:9, 9:2

The causal chain: **FIRE** (Babylon burns, Ezekiel 28:18 "fire from the midst of thee") **→ SMOKE** (Revelation 18:9 "smoke of her burning") **→ DARKNESS** (Revelation 9:2 "sun darkened by reason of the smoke"). The sackcloth of Revelation 6:12 ("sun became black as sackcloth") is what the smoke looks like from below.

This means vv29-31 are the smoke report — the visible aftermath of the fire that burned throughout vv4-28. The Son of Man appears **through** that smoke/cloud (v30). The smoke of Babylon's judgment IS the cloud of Christ's appearing.


## "Before" Means "Facing"

> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, **before** the great and terrible day of the LORD come.
> — Joel 2:31 / Acts 2:20

The Hebrew word is **H6440 liphnei** — literally "to the **face** of." It is built on the word for face (paniym). It can mean "prior to" in time, or it can mean "**in the presence of**" — facing, in front of.

If "before" means **temporal** (prior to), the cosmic signs are advance warnings you can watch for.

If "before" means **facing** (in the presence of), the cosmic signs ARE the day of the LORD unfolding. There is no gap. No countdown. The darkening and the blood-moon happen facing the great day — they are part of it, not precursors to it.

Peter's Pentecost quote settles this. In Acts 2:16-20, Peter says:

> **This IS that** which was spoken by the prophet Joel... the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, **before** that great and notable day of the Lord come.

Peter declared that the church age — from Pentecost forward — is already inside the "before the great day" window. If "before" meant a narrow time gap just prior to the day, Peter could not say "this is that" about events 2,000+ years earlier. But if "before" means **facing** — the entire period from Pentecost onward is facing the great day. Standing in front of it. In the presence of its approach.

There are no advance cosmic warnings before the day. The signs and the day are one. The only event that happens during normalcy, with no preceding signs and no warning, is the vanishing.


## The 144,000: The Witness Commission

The 144,000 are commonly treated as a mysterious number. But the pattern is visible in Jesus's own ministry:

> After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place.
> — Luke 10:1

Some manuscripts read seventy-two. Either way: 72 sent in pairs = 72 × 2 = **144** witnesses. The 144,000 are this same witness commission multiplied to kingdom scale — 144 × 1,000 = the full measure of the covenant witness community.

And the two witnesses of Revelation 11:3 are the representative pair — sent two by two, like the 72, to prophesy for 1,260 days. The two are the visible embodiment of the 144,000 commission: olive trees (oil source) and lampstands (commandment-bearers), doing the same work the 72 did — going before His face into every city and place.

The 144,000 appear again in Revelation 14:1-5 standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion, with the Father's name on their foreheads. They are called **firstfruits** (G536 aparche) — the first harvest. They "follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." These are the man-child company: the overcomers, the firstfruits, caught up to God's throne before the pain came.

### The Three Eagles Declare

In Revelation 8:13, an eagle (G105 aetos — some manuscripts read "angel," and the eagle study confirms eagle = angel/messenger) flies through heaven declaring:

> Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

Three woes. Three remaining trumpets. Three angel-messengers with escalating declarations:

- **5th trumpet / 1st woe** — The abyss opens, smoke darkens the sun, tormenting agents emerge (Rev 9:1-12)
- **6th trumpet / 2nd woe** — The Euphrates army, one-third of men killed (Rev 9:13-21)
- **7th trumpet / 3rd woe** — "The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever" (Rev 11:15)

Then in Revelation 14:6-11, three more angels declare:

1. "Fear God... the hour of his **judgment** is come" (v6-7)
2. "**Babylon is fallen**, is fallen" (v8)
3. Warning: those who take the **mark** drink the wine of God's wrath (v9-11)

The eagles/angels are the heralds of the sequence. They announce judgment, they announce Babylon's fall, they announce the kingdom transfer. The same messengers who carried Israel on eagles' wings (Exodus 19:4) now declare the consummation of what began at Sinai.

### 3.5 Days = 3.5 Prophetic Years

The two witnesses prophesy for 1,260 days (Revelation 11:3) — the first 3.5 years. Then the beast kills them. Their bodies lie in the street for **3.5 days** (Rev 11:9,11).

Ezekiel 4:6 establishes the day-year principle: "I have appointed thee each day for a year." If 3.5 days = 3.5 prophetic years, then the witnesses' "death" period IS the second half of the seven-year span — the same 1,260 days when the beast exercises authority (Rev 13:5) and the woman hides in the wilderness (Rev 12:6).

The witnesses prophesy alive for the first 3.5 years. Their bodies lie dead for the second 3.5 years (= 3.5 "days"). Then:

> After three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet... and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud.
> — Revelation 11:11-12

They rise. They ascend. And the **seventh trumpet** sounds immediately after (Rev 11:15) — the kingdom is declared. The resurrection of the witnesses marks the end of the full seven-year period and the transfer of the kingdom.

The 3.5 days of death are not a brief interlude. They are the second half of the tribulation experienced as death by the witness community — the word withdrawn (Amos 8:11), the famine of hearing, the earth celebrating the silence of the prophets (Rev 11:10). And their resurrection IS the kingdom arriving.


## The Kingdom Must Be Declared at the Start

Two independent calculations converge on why the kingdom declaration falls at the **beginning**, not the end.

### 1. The Jubilee Trumpet Initiates

> Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land.
> — Leviticus 25:9-10

The Jubilee trumpet is blown at the **start** of the Jubilee year, not at the end. The trumpet **initiates** the return:
- Debts cancelled
- Slaves freed
- Land returned to its original owner

These are not things that happen gradually over the Jubilee year and are then declared at the end. The trumpet IS the declaration. The declaration IS what starts the process. The "last trump" of 1 Corinthians 15:52 = the 7th trumpet of Revelation 11:15 = the Jubilee trumpet. And the Jubilee trumpet says: the kingdom transfers NOW. All things return to their rightful owner. Liberty is proclaimed. The trumpet doesn't summarize what happened — it commands what begins.

### 2. Seventy Seventy = 4,900 Years

Daniel 9:24's "seventy seventy" (שבעים שבעים — identical consonants repeated) can be read as 70 × 70 = **4,900 years**. The Daniel 9 study traces this calculation:

| From Abraham's Covenant (~1876 BC) | Years | Event |
|---|---|---|
| Abraham → Kingdom Declared | 3,900 | ~2025 AD |
| Kingdom Declared → End of Millennium | 1,000 | ~3025 AD |
| **Total: Abraham → End of Millennium** | **4,900** | **= 70 × 70** |

The 4,900 years only work if the kingdom is declared at the **start** of the millennial reign — 3,900 years from Abraham — with the 1,000-year reign completing the 70 × 70 total.

This aligns with the independent calculation from the Jordan crossing:

> 70 jubilees (70 × 49 = 3,430 years) from the Jordan crossing (1406 BC) = **~2024 AD**

Two paths. Same destination. The 70-jubilee count from when Israel entered the land, and the 70 × 70 count from Abraham's covenant, both converge on our generation — with the kingdom declaration at the start, not at some distant future endpoint.

The kingdom is declared at the taking of Babylon because the Jubilee trumpet doesn't wait for everything to be cleaned up. It proclaims liberty. The 1,000-year reign is the Jubilee itself — the era in which the debts are actually cancelled, the slaves actually freed, the land actually returned. The trumpet starts it. The 70 × 70 contains it. And the total — from Abraham's covenant through the millennial reign — completes Daniel 9:24's six purposes: finish transgression, seal sins, atone for iniquity, bring everlasting righteousness, seal vision and prophecy, anoint the holy of holies.


## The Fall of Babylon IS the Jubilee

The word-cloud of the Jubilee (Leviticus 25:9-55) and the word-cloud of Jeremiah 50-51 are the same vocabulary. Every major Jubilee concept appears in the Babylon-fall oracle:

| Jubilee (Lev 25) | Jeremiah 50-51 |
|---|---|
| **Trumpet** blown to initiate (Lev 25:9) | "**Shout** against her round about" (50:15); "Blow the **trumpet** among the nations" (51:27) |
| **Liberty** proclaimed (Lev 25:10) | "**Come out** of her, my people" (51:45); "**Remove** out of the midst of Babylon" (50:8) |
| **Redeemer** (H1350 gaal) acts (Lev 25:25,48-49) | "Their **Redeemer** (H1350 gaal) is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name" (50:34) |
| **Slaves freed** — bondservants released (Lev 25:41,54) | "All that took them **captives** held them fast; they **refused to let them go**... their Redeemer is strong" (50:33-34) |
| **Debts cancelled** — obligations released (Lev 25:28) | "The **iniquity** of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be **none**; the sins of Judah, they shall **not be found**: for I will **pardon** them whom I reserve" (50:20) |
| **Land returned** to original owner (Lev 25:13,28) | "I will bring Israel again to **his habitation**, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan" (50:19) |
| **Rest** for the land (Lev 25:4-5) | "That he may give **rest** (H7280 raga) to the land" (50:34) |
| **Return** to family and possession (Lev 25:10,13,41) | "Children of Israel shall **come**... seek the LORD... **Come**, let us join ourselves to the LORD in a **perpetual covenant**" (50:4-5) |
| **Perpetual** — Jubilee resets the covenant cycle | "A **perpetual covenant** that shall not be forgotten" (50:5) |

The concentration is remarkable. Jeremiah 50:33-34 alone contains **four** Jubilee terms in two verses: captives held (slavery) → redeemer (H1350 gaal, THE Jubilee redemption word) → plead their cause (legal release) → give rest to the land (Sabbath/Jubilee rest).

And Jeremiah 50:20 is the Jubilee of debts applied to **sin**: "the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none." The debt is not just forgiven — it **cannot be found**. Total cancellation. This is not fulfilled at 539 BC, when Israel's sin continued. It awaits the cosmic Jubilee — the fall of Babylon the Great.

**The fall of Babylon IS the Jubilee enacted at cosmic scale.** The 7th trumpet of Revelation 11:15 ("the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord") IS the Jubilee trumpet of Leviticus 25:9. The same trumpet. The same event. The kingdom transfers because Babylon falls. Babylon falls because the Jubilee trumpet sounds. Liberty is proclaimed. Slaves freed. Debts cancelled. Land returned. The Redeemer is strong.

This is why the kingdom must be declared at the **start**: the Jubilee trumpet initiates. And this is why the fall of Babylon and the kingdom declaration are simultaneous — they are the same event described in different vocabularies. Leviticus calls it Jubilee. Jeremiah calls it the fall of Babylon. Revelation calls it the 7th trumpet. One event. One trumpet. One cosmic reset.


## The Similitude of Jericho

The fall of Jericho is the enacted pattern of Babylon's fall:

1. Yeshua appears as captain of the LORD's host with drawn sword (Joshua 5:13-15)
2. Rahab, the harlot who guarded the messengers, is marked with a scarlet cord (Joshua 2:18) — the blood-covenant marker
3. Seven days of circling in silence = the bounded testimony period
4. On the seventh day, the seventh circuit — the trumpet blast and the shout (Joshua 6:20)
5. Rahab and her household **extracted** from the city (Joshua 6:22-23) — brought outside the camp
6. **Then** the city burned with fire (Joshua 6:24)

The extraction happens BEFORE the fire. Rahab is brought out, and then Jericho burns. The same sequence as Sodom: Lot out, then fire. The same sequence as the man child: delivered before pain, then birth pangs.

> For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.
> — 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17

The shout and trumpet of Jericho. The extraction of Rahab. The burning of the city. The pattern is walked out in real history and repeated at eschatological scale.


## The Similitude of Lot

> It was the same in the days of Lot: People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building. But on the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. It will be just like that on the day the Son of Man is revealed.
> — Luke 17:28-30

Yeshua explicitly identifies the Lot story as the pattern for His revealing. The angels physically seized Lot's hand and carried him out — harpazo in narrative form. Destruction was not permitted until Lot was safe:

> I cannot do anything till thou be come thither.
> — Genesis 19:22

And the passage continues immediately with the separation:

> I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed: one will be taken and the other left.
> — Luke 17:34

This is not the climactic return after cosmic signs. This is the night-time vanishing during normalcy — eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building. And on the **same day** the righteous are extracted, fire falls.

  "Great Babylon came in remembrance before God" (Rev 16:19)

  Last trump = kingdom transfer = dead raised (1 Cor 15:52)
        │
GATHERING OF REMAINING ELECT — Apantesis Escort
  "Gather together his elect from the four winds" (Mat 24:31)
  Civic escort toward earth (G529 apantesis, 1Th 4:17)
  Converging on the literal Mountain — Mount Zion (Isa 27:13)
  "Her children" born through travail (Isa 66:8)
  Nation born in a day
```

The man child is delivered before the pain. The mother repents under judgment and flees. The children are born through the travail. Three groups from the same mother. Same God. Different timings.

The overcomers vanish during normalcy — eating, drinking, farming, milling. No cosmic signs. No trumpet. No warning. As a thief in the night. Their removal releases the restraint. The horsemen ride.

For the first 1,260 days, two witnesses prophesy in sackcloth while Babylon collapses around them. At the midpoint, the beast acts — the witnesses are killed, the abomination is installed, and Israel flees to the wilderness. The dragon sends armies (the "flood" of Daniel 9:26 and Revelation 12:15) after the fleeing woman, but the earth swallows the flood. For the second 1,260 days, the beast exercises authority while the woman is nourished in hiding.

Then Babylon burns. The smoke rises. The authorities darken. The King appears through the smoke. The trumpet sounds. The remaining elect — those who endured through the tribulation, the remnant of her seed — are gathered at the great trumpet with a civic escort toward earth.

The nation is born in a day. The kingdom that cannot be shaken receives those whose names are written in the book.
