# Blood Moon Over the Moon City

On the first day of the twelfth month — just weeks from now — a total lunar eclipse will turn the full moon blood-red. The keseh will become blood. For those who know what Scripture says about this date, this moon, and this year, the convergence is difficult to dismiss.


## The Moon and the Throne Share a Root

The Hebrew word for full moon is **keseh** (H3677), from the root H3680 *kasah* = "to fill up." The Hebrew word for throne is **kissé** (H3678) — from the same root. When the moon reaches fullness, the throne is filled. When the king takes his seat, the moon is full.

> Blow the horn at the new moon, at the **full moon** for our feast-day.
> — Psalm 81:3 (JPS)

Trumpet + full moon bound in one command.

The shofar and the full moon are bound in the same command.

> He hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the **full moon**.
> — Proverbs 7:20 (JPS)

The husband departs. He returns at the keseh — the full moon. The bride knows the season but not the exact day or hour. The bridegroom returns when the throne is filled.

And Psalm 89 states the equation outright:

> His seed shall endure for ever, and his **throne** as the sun before me. It shall be established for ever as the **moon**, and as a faithful witness in heaven.
> — Psalm 89:36-37

The throne IS the sun. Established AS the moon. The moon = a faithful witness (H539 aman).


## The Same Word

It goes deeper than a shared root. Remove the vowel points — the nikud added by the Masoretes roughly 600-900 AD — and look at the consonants alone:

- **כֶּסֶא** (keseh) = full moon — consonants: **כסא**
- **כִּסֵּא** (kissé) = throne — consonants: **כסא**

**Identical.** כסא = כסא. Kaf-samekh-aleph. The only difference is the vowel points. Without the pointing, the unpointed text כסא reads BOTH "full moon" AND "throne" simultaneously. The Masoretic pointing forces a choice. The consonantal text holds both.

There is a strong case that Revelation was originally written in Hebrew, not Greek (hebrewgospels.com). The Hebrew text of Revelation 4:2 reads:

> וְרָאִיתִי **כִּסֵּא** אֶחָד יֹשֵׁב בַּשָּׁמַיִם וְעַל הַ**כִּסֵּא** יֹשֵׁב אֶחָד
> — Revelation 4:2

Without vowel points:

> וראיתי **כסא** אחד ישב בשמים ועל ה**כסא** ישב אחד

"I saw a **כסא** set in heaven, and one sat on the **כסא**."

Throne or full moon? The consonantal text says *both*. If Hebrew was the original language, John didn't use a word that *resembles* the full moon — he used the same word. Every כסא in Revelation — all 47 of them — carries both readings in the unpointed text:

- Rev 12:5 — Man child caught up to his **כסא** = to his throne / to his full moon
- Rev 14:3 — 144,000 sing before the **כסא** = before the throne / before the full moon
- Rev 16:17 — "It is done" from the **כסא** = from the throne / from the full moon
- Rev 20:11 — A great white **כסא** = a great white throne / a great white full moon

The great white throne IS the great white full moon. The man child is caught up to the full moon. "It is done" is declared from the full moon. The consonantal text doesn't distinguish between them because they ARE the same concept: the place of fullness, the seat of authority, the appointed time of the king.

And it is not unusual for the כסא to speak. Psalm 19 already established that the heavens have a voice:

> **Night unto night showeth knowledge.** There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
> — Psalm 19:2-4

Night unto night — that is the moon's domain. The moon *shows knowledge*. Its voice is heard in every language. Its line reaches all the earth. So when Revelation 16:17 says "a great voice from the כסא, saying, *It is done*" — the full moon has been speaking since Genesis. It is a faithful witness (Psalm 89:37). It shows knowledge. And on the appointed day, it declares the kingdom.

A Greek reader sees *thronos*. An English reader sees "throne." A Hebrew reader sees כסא — and hears the full moon.


## The כסא Through Hebrew Scripture

Once you hear it, you cannot unhear it. Every כסא in the Old Testament carries the keseh overtone. Some verses transform entirely:

> Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his **כסא**.
> — Psalm 97:2

Clouds and darkness surrounding the כסא. Read as throne: poetic atmosphere. Read as full moon: a lunar eclipse — clouds and darkness literally surrounding the full moon. This verse describes what a blood moon looks like. And it says this is the *habitation* of His כסא — the clouds and darkness are not a disruption. They are where the כסא dwells.

> I saw the LORD sitting on his **כסא**, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.
> — 1 Kings 22:19

The כסא surrounded by the host of heaven. Read as full moon: the full moon at center, the stars arrayed on every side. That is literally what you see on the 15th of the month.

> The king made a great **כסא** of ivory, and overlaid it with gold. The **כסא** had six steps, and the top of the **כסא** was **round** behind.
> — 1 Kings 10:18-19

Solomon's כסא is **round**. The full moon is round. White ivory overlaid with gold — white and luminous. Six steps ascending to it. Two lions guarding. The physical throne was built in the shape of what כסא already means.

> The **heaven** is my **כסא**, and the earth is my footstool.
> — Isaiah 66:1

Heaven IS the כסא. Not "the כסא is in heaven" — heaven itself is the seat. The sky IS the full-moon throne.

> The LORD's **כסא** is in heaven: his **eyes** behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
> — Psalm 11:4

The כסא in heaven has eyes that watch. The full moon in heaven, surrounded by stars, watches the earth.

> I beheld till the **כסאות** were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was **white as snow**, and the hair of his head like the **pure wool**: his **כסא** was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.
> — Daniel 7:9

Multiple כסאות overturned — the old authority-moons ended. Then the Ancient of Days takes His כסא. White as snow. Pure wool. White and radiant — the brightest object in the night sky.

> I will exalt my **כסא** above the stars of God.
> — Isaiah 14:13

The counterfeit: Satan wants his כסא above the stars. His full moon above the host of heaven. The false keseh.


## Eyes = Stars

Revelation makes the equation explicit through a three-link chain:

- Rev 5:6 — The Lamb has seven **eyes**, which are the seven **Spirits** of God
- Rev 3:1 — He that hath the seven **Spirits** of God, and the seven **stars**
- Rev 1:20 — The seven **stars** are the angels of the seven churches

Seven **eyes** = seven **Spirits** = seven **stars**. Eyes ARE stars. The Spirits are the link.

Now re-read the Hebrew of Revelation 4:6,8:

> וּבְתוֹךְ הַכִּסֵּא וְסָבִיב לְהַכִּסֵּא אַרְבַּע חַיּוֹת **מָלֵא עֵינַיִם** מִלִּפְנֵיהֶם וּמֵאַחֲרֵיהֶם
> — Revelation 4:6,8

**מָלֵא עֵינַיִם** — "full of eyes." But eyes = stars. Full of eyes = full of stars. The living creatures around the כסא are covered in stars. That IS the night sky around the full moon — the כסא at center, the עֵינַיִם filling the space in every direction, before and behind, within and without.

Daniel 10:6 confirms: "his **eyes as lamps of fire**" — eyes = lamps = lights. The eyes around the כסא are the lights around the full moon.


## Ancient of Days — The Keseh Presider

> The **Ancient of days** did sit, whose garment was **white as snow**, and the hair of his head like the **pure wool**: his **כסא** was like the fiery flame.
> — Daniel 7:9

White as snow. Pure wool. Radiant. Sitting on the כסא. This is the description of the brightest white object in the night sky — the full moon at its seat.

On a calendar where months begin at the full moon, the **first day** of every month IS the keseh. The "Ancient of days" — the One who has presided over the beginning of days since creation — sits at the כסא that marks every month's start. Every full moon is His seat. He is the ancient one who has been at the keseh since God appointed the moon for mo'edim:

> He appointed the moon for seasons [H4150 mo'edim = appointed times].
> — Psalm 104:19

And at the last keseh:

> One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came **to** the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom.
> — Daniel 7:13-14

The Son of Man approaches the כסא. The kingdom is given AT the keseh. At the full moon, the throne is filled, and dominion transfers.


## Twelve כסאות — Twelve Full Moons

> Ye also shall sit upon **twelve thrones**, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
> — Matthew 19:28

Twelve כסאות. Twelve months. Twelve full moons. If כסא = keseh, then twelve thrones = twelve keseh-days per year. Each month has its full-moon throne-day. Twelve tribes judged by twelve monthly keseh-seats.

The **last** of the twelve = the 12th month = Adar = where the blood moon falls.

> Round about the throne were four and twenty seats [thronoi]: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting.
> — Revelation 4:4

24 כסאות around THE כסא. 24 = the priestly courses (1 Chronicles 24:1-19). Two courses served per month = 24 per year = 12 months of keseh-service.

> And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them.
> — Revelation 20:4

Plural כסאות for judgment. Keseh-days for judgment. The saints sit at the full-moon seats.


## The Throne Room IS the Night Sky

Read Revelation 4:2-8 as a single scene, with every כסא as keseh and every עין as star:

- A **כסא** was set in heaven — *the full moon set in the sky*
- and one sat on the **כסא** — *the Ancient of Days, white and radiant*
- a rainbow round about the **כסא**, like an emerald — *the lunar halo, a ring of light around the full moon*
- four and twenty **כסאות** round about — *24 priestly course-seats, 12 months of service*
- lightnings and thunderings and voices from the **כסא** — *the moon speaks (Psalm 19:2)*
- seven lamps of fire before the **כסא** — *the seven visible planets*
- a sea of glass like crystal — *the clear night sky, or the sea reflecting the moon*
- four living creatures **full of eyes** — *four directions of sky, full of stars*

> — Revelation 4:2-8

This is not a metaphor. It is what you **see** when you look up at a full moon on a clear night. The כסא at center, radiant and white. A halo of light around it. The stars filling every direction — eyes watching, before and behind, within and without. The planets arrayed as lamps. The sky itself as a sea of glass. And the whole scene speaking, night unto night showing knowledge, its line gone out through all the earth.

John did not describe an alien room in another dimension. He described the sky. In Hebrew. And the word he used for the seat at the center — כסא — is the same word, in the same consonants, as the full moon that sits there.


## Every Sign of His Coming Is a Full-Moon Phenomenon

> As the lightning [G796 astrapē = bright shining, glare] cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
> — Matthew 24:27

The full moon is the only body that rises east and illuminates west all night.

> Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed.
> — Joshua 10:12-13

Sun west, moon east = opposition = full moon only.

> The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy glittering spear.
> — Habakkuk 3:11

Same full-moon opposition. Same prophetic battle.

> At evening time it shall be light.
> — Zechariah 14:7

Evening light = full moon rising at sunset.

> The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before [liphnei = facing] the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.
> — Joel 2:31

Must be full to see blood-color.


## Before the Trumpet — Silence

> But the LORD is in his holy temple: **let all the earth keep silence before him**.
> — Habakkuk 2:20

Earth commanded to silence. The very next chapter: sun and moon stand still.

> And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, **Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice**, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.
> — Joshua 6:10

Silence before the trumpet at the moon city.

> And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was **silence in heaven** about the space of half an hour.
> — Revelation 8:1

Silence before the seven trumpets.

> **Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD**: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.
> — Zechariah 2:13

All flesh still. Then come the horsemen visions.

Silence is not passive waiting. It is commanded stillness before God acts. Heaven goes quiet. The earth holds its breath. All flesh is still. Then the shofar. Then the shout. Then the walls fall.


## The Moon City

Jericho (H3405) comes from H3394 **yareach** = "moon." The moon city — the city of borrowed light. It sits 800 feet below sea level, the lowest city on earth. Going *down* to Jericho = descent from God's presence. And Jericho is the first city God devotes entirely to destruction — the prototype of how He topples fortified systems.

> So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets... and the wall fell down flat.
> — Joshua 6:20

Silence → trumpet → walls fall.

> And Joshua said unto the two men... Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath... And they brought out Rahab... And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein.
> — Joshua 6:22-24

Extraction THEN fire.

> And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
> — Revelation 11:15

7th trumpet = kingdom transfers = Babylon falls.

> Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
> — Revelation 18:4

> Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.
> — Revelation 18:8


## The Date: First of the Twelfth Month

> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month... I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee.
> — Ezekiel 32:1,7-8

The ONLY darkening oracle that names the covering agent: cloud = smoke.

> The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.
> — Matthew 24:29

Source text: Isaiah 13:10 = "the burden of BABYLON."


## Five Days Before: The Horsemen Scout

> Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month... We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
> — Zechariah 1:7,11

False peace. 5 days before the darkening oracle of Adar 1.

> For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
> — 1 Thessalonians 5:3


## The Fall of Babylon IS the Jubilee

> Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month... And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout all the land.
> — Leviticus 25:9-10

> Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
> — Jeremiah 50:8

> In those days... the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
> — Jeremiah 50:20

Debts cancelled. Sins not found.

> Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land.
> — Jeremiah 50:34

H1350 gaal = THE Jubilee redemption word. + Rest for the land.


## Are the Sun and Moon the Two Witnesses?

The two witnesses of Revelation 11 prophesy for 1,260 days "clothed in sackcloth." The sun becomes "black as sackcloth" (Rev 6:12). Same word. Same covering. And the parallels run deeper than the garment:

> The heavens declare the glory of God... Day unto day uttereth speech, night unto night showeth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.
> — Psalm 19:1-4

Paul quotes this in Romans 10:18 for the gospel going to all nations.

Consider what matches:

- **Two** witnesses (Rev 11:3) — **Two** great lights (Gen 1:16)
- Two **lampstands** standing before God (Rev 11:4) — Two celestial **lamps** standing in the heavens
- Clothed in **sackcloth** (Rev 11:3) — Sun black as **sackcloth** (Rev 6:12)
- **Fire** from their mouths (Rev 11:5) — The sun IS fire
- Power to shut heaven that it **rain not** (Rev 11:6) — The sun drives the water cycle
- Power to turn **waters to blood** (Rev 11:6) — Waters = peoples (Rev 17:15). Peoples to blood = the nations under judgment
- Testimony reaches all nations (Mat 24:14) — "Their line gone out through **all the earth**" (Ps 19:4)
- A **faithful witness** — The moon IS a "faithful witness in heaven" (Ps 89:37)

Not everything maps cleanly. The two olive trees also represent Israel (Rom 11:17-24). The death and resurrection after 3.5 days doesn't have an obvious astronomical parallel — unless the 3.5 "days" are 3.5 years of total darkness (the second half when the beast reigns), after which the luminaries are restored. And the beast "killing" the witnesses (Rev 11:7) works better as authority-collapse than literal extinction of the sun.

The connection may not be one-to-one identity but typological resonance: the sun and moon are the PATTERN for what the two witnesses do. They testify to all the earth. They wear sackcloth. Their testimony is faithful. Their light goes dark. And their restoration signals the kingdom.


## Moses Vanished on This Date

The timeline places Moses' death on **Adar 1** — the first day of the twelfth month. The same calendar date as Ezekiel's darkening oracle. Here's how we know:

> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of Israel.
> — Deuteronomy 1:3

Moses begins his farewell on Shevat 1 (11th month). The entire book of Deuteronomy is this speech.

Moses finishes speaking. He dies. Israel mourns **thirty days** (Deut 34:8). Then Joshua gives a three-day command (Josh 1:11), sends spies (Josh 2), and Israel crosses the Jordan on **Nisan 10** (Josh 4:19). Counting backward: Nisan 10 minus ~10 days preparation = Nisan 1. Nisan 1 minus 30 days mourning = **Adar 1**.

But what happened to his body?

> And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but **no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day**.
> — Deuteronomy 34:6

> Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he **disputed about the body of Moses**, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.
> — Jude 1:9

God buried Moses. No one knows where. An archangel fought the devil over his body. And then Moses **appears alive** on the Mount of Transfiguration (Mat 17:3) — visible, speaking with Jesus.

Moses vanished on Adar 1. His body was not found. He appeared alive later. This is the same pattern as Enoch — "he was **not** (H369 ayin), for God took him" (Gen 5:24). And the same pattern as Daniel 9:26's patched reading — Messiah cuts a covenant and **vanishes** (ayin). Three vanishings. The same word. And Moses' vanishing falls on the same calendar date as the darkening oracle: the first of the twelfth month.


## The Blood Moon

Joel 2:31 says the moon will turn to blood "before" the great day. The Hebrew word is **liphnei** (H6440) — literally "to the *face* of." Built on the word for face (paniym). It can mean "prior to" in time. Or it can mean "**in the presence of**" — facing, in front of.

If "before" means *temporal*, the blood moon is an advance warning you can watch for before the day arrives. If "before" means *facing*, the blood moon IS the day arriving — the signs and the day are one. There is no gap.

Peter settles which reading is correct. At Pentecost, he quotes Joel and declares:

> And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh... And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.
> — Acts 2:17-20

And just before this quotation, Peter says:

> But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel.
> — Acts 2:16

"**This IS that.**" Peter declared that the Joel prophecy — Spirit outpouring, blood, fire, smoke, sun to darkness, moon to blood — was *already unfolding* at Pentecost. The liphnei window is not a narrow gap before a distant event. It is the era that faces the great day. But the moon was not blood for 2,000 years. The specific signs — sun darkened, moon to blood — happen at specific moments *within* that facing-era. Peter proves we are inside the window. The blood moon tells you where in the window you are standing.


## The Last Trump

> In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
> — 1 Corinthians 15:52

"The last trump" — G2078 *eschatos* (farthest, final) + G4536 *salpinx* (trumpet). Last of what sequence?

The word "Jubilee" itself is a trumpet. Hebrew **yobel** (H3104) means "the blast of a horn; ram's horn; trumpet." The Jubilee year is literally the *ram's-horn year*. When Leviticus 25:9 says "cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound," the Hebrew is nearly redundant — "cause the horn of the horn to sound." The Jubilee IS a trumpet blast.

Now consider: if the shofar is blown at every full moon (Psalm 81:3), then the twelfth month's full moon carries the *last* full-moon trumpet of the year. The "last trump" could be the trumpet of the last month — Adar's full moon.

And if yobel = ram's horn = trumpet, then the "last yobel" = the last jubilee trumpet. If we are at the end of the 70th jubilee, the "last trump" is the final blast of the final jubilee cycle — the trumpet that closes the era and opens the kingdom.

The "last trump" may work at three scales simultaneously: the last of the seven trumpets (Revelation 11:15), the last full-moon trumpet of the year (Adar), and the last jubilee trumpet of the 70th cycle. All three converge on one moment.


## The Convergence

A blood moon is coming on the first day of the twelfth month. On the date of Ezekiel's darkening oracle. In the last month of the 70th jubilee. While the full-moon study shows that *keseh* (full moon) shares its root with *kissé* (throne). The throne-day turning to blood. The king's appointed time.

The moon city will fall at the trumpet. The trumpet is blown at the full moon. The full moon will turn to blood. And we are facing the day.
