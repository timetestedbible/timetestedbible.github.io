# DAY — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Exposure |
| **Two Words** | Time of Accountability |
| **Sentence** | The season of visibility and opportunity—the time when conduct is exposed to scrutiny, when work can be done, and when one must live as though being watched |

**Opposite**: Night = Hiddenness / Season of Unawareness

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly equates DAY with LIGHT:

- **Genesis 1:5** — "God called the **light Day**, and the darkness he called Night"

This is foundational: **DAY = LIGHT**. Since LIGHT = Visible Obedience / Example, DAY represents the *time/season* of that visibility.

The parallel is confirmed throughout Scripture:

- **1 Thessalonians 5:5** — "Ye are all the children of **light**, and the children of the **day**: we are not of the **night**, nor of **darkness**"
- **Romans 13:12-13** — "The night is far spent, the **day** is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of **darkness**, and let us put on the armour of **light**. Let us walk honestly, **as in the day**"

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What does "day" represent functionally?

| Function | Verse |
|----------|-------|
| **Time for work** | John 9:4 — "I must work... while it is **day**: the night cometh, when no man can work" |
| **Time of visibility** | John 11:9 — "If any man walk in the **day**, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the **light**" |
| **Time of honest conduct** | Rom 13:13 — "Let us walk honestly, **as in the day**" |
| **Time of accountability** | 1 Thess 5:4 — "ye... are not in darkness, that **that day** should overtake you as a thief" |
| **Time of judgment** | 2 Peter 3:10 — "the **day of the Lord** will come... the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up" |

The pattern: DAY = the time when things are visible, when work can be done, when accountability applies.

### 3. The "Day of the Lord" Pattern

Throughout Scripture, "the day of the Lord" is the time of judgment and exposure:

- **1 Thessalonians 5:2** — "the **day of the Lord** so cometh as a thief in the night"
- **2 Peter 3:10** — "the **day of the Lord** will come... the earth also and **the works** that are therein shall be burned up"
- **1 Corinthians 3:13** — "Every man's work shall be made manifest: for **the day** shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire"

"The day" = the time when works are exposed and judged. This is why believers should "walk honestly, as in the day" — living as though the day of accountability has already arrived.

### 4. The Behavioral Evidence

How should we relate to "day"?

- **Walk honestly in it**: Romans 13:13 — "Let us walk honestly, as in the day"
- **Be children of it**: 1 Thessalonians 5:5 — "Ye are all... the children of the day"
- **Work while in it**: John 9:4 — "I must work... while it is day"
- **Be sober in it**: 1 Thessalonians 5:8 — "let us, who are of the day, be sober"

### 5. Why "EXPOSURE" / "TIME OF ACCOUNTABILITY"?

**Considered alternatives:**

| Meaning | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Daytime hours" | Dictionary definition—physical, not symbolic |
| "Visible obedience" (same as LIGHT) | DAY = LIGHT, but DAY emphasizes the TIME aspect |
| "Opportunity" alone | Misses the accountability/exposure dimension |

**"Exposure / Time of Accountability" captures both functions:**
- The time when things are **visible** (you can see to work, conduct is exposed)
- The time when **work must be done** (before night comes)
- The time of **judgment** (the day shall declare every man's work)

### 6. The Human Application Test

"Can humans BE 'of the day'?" — **YES**

- 1 Thessalonians 5:5: "Ye are all... **the children of the day**"
- 1 Thessalonians 5:8: "let us, **who are of the day**, be sober"

Believers are called to live AS THOUGH in the day—conducting themselves openly, as if everything they do is visible and accountable.

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Genesis 1:5** — "God called the **light Day**, and the darkness he called Night"
   
   The foundational equation: DAY = LIGHT. This establishes that "day" symbolically represents what "light" represents—visibility.

2. **Romans 13:12-13** — "The night is far spent, the **day** is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk honestly, **as in the day**"
   
   The application: "Walk honestly, as in the day" — conduct yourself as if you are being watched, as if there is nowhere to hide. The day is coming; live now as you will be revealed then.

3. **John 9:4-5** — "I must work the works of him that sent me, **while it is day**: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the **light** of the world."
   
   Day = the time of opportunity for work. Jesus identifies "day" with his presence as "the light of the world."

4. **1 Thessalonians 5:4-8** — "ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that **that day** should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all the children of light, and **the children of the day**: we are not of the night, nor of darkness... let us, **who are of the day**, be sober"
   
   Believers are "children of the day"—they belong to the realm of visibility and accountability, not to the realm of hiddenness.

5. **1 Corinthians 3:13** — "Every man's work shall be made manifest: for **the day** shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire"
   
   "The day" = the time when all works are exposed and judged. Nothing remains hidden.

## Conclusion

DAY symbolizes **exposure** and the **time of accountability**—the season when conduct is visible, when work can be done, and when one lives as though being watched.

While LIGHT describes the *state* of visible obedience, DAY describes the *time* when that visibility applies. This is why "the day of the Lord" is the ultimate time of judgment and exposure—when all hidden things come to light.

The practical application: believers are called to be "children of the day," living NOW as they will be revealed THEN. "Walk honestly, as in the day" means conducting oneself as though there is nowhere to hide—because ultimately, there isn't.
