# OIL — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Works |
| **Two Words** | Proven Works |
| **Sentence** | Works that have been tested and proven through trials—as oil is produced by pressing/crushing olives (fruit of the covenant tree), so proven works result from tested faithfulness |

**Opposite**: Untested / Unproven

## The Key: Trace the Origin

**How is oil made?**
1. OLIVES (fruit) from OLIVE TREES
2. Olives are PRESSED/CRUSHED
3. OIL is extracted

**Symbolic chain:**
- OLIVE TREE = Israel/Covenant Community (Romans 11)
- OLIVES = Works (FRUIT = Works)
- PRESSING = Trials/Testing
- OIL = **Proven Works**

---

## Why OIL ≠ Spirit

**Matthew 25:9** — "go **buy**" oil
**Acts 8:20** — Spirit **cannot be purchased**

The Spirit is a gift. Oil can be "bought" (acquired through effort).

Therefore: OIL = something you can acquire = **Proven Works**

## Parable of Ten Virgins

- **Wise** had oil = had proven works, reserves of tested faithfulness
- **Foolish** had no oil = had not built up proven works
- Cannot borrow = cannot use someone else's track record

---

## Gethsemane = "Oil Press"

Jesus was "pressed" in the garden of the Oil Press before crucifixion — the ultimate test producing the ultimate proven work.

## Production Chain

| Stage | Physical | Symbolic |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Source | Olive Tree | Covenant Community (TREE) |
| Fruit | Olives | Works (FRUIT) |
| Process | Pressing | Trials/Testing |
| Product | Oil | Proven Works |
| **Use** | **Oil burnt → Light** | **Proven works → Visible example (LIGHT)** |

Oil in lamps is burnt to produce visible light. So proven works, when “spent” in witness and obedience, become our **visible example** to others—the light on the stand (Matthew 5:14–16). The same oil (proven works) that sustains the lamp is what makes the light visible.

## Summary

**OIL** = **PROVEN WORKS**

Not the Spirit (which is a gift), but works that have been tested through trials. This is why you can "buy" it and why the foolish virgins couldn't borrow it. Oil burnt in a lamp gives **visible light**—so proven works become our **visible example** to the world (LIGHT = visible testimony; see LAMP, LIGHT).
