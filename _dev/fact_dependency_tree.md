# Fact Dependency Tree for "Time Tested Tradition"

## FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS (No dependencies - these are axioms)

### ScripturalAuthority
- Scripture is true, sufficient, and cannot be broken
- Every word of God is pure (Prov. 30:5)
- Scripture cannot be added to or subtracted from (Deut. 4:2; Rev. 22:18-19)

### HermeneuticalPrinciples
- Plain/literal reading of Scripture is preferred over tradition
- Scripture reveals truth through narrative examples, not just explicit rules
- We should test all things and hold to what is good

### CalendarAccessibility
- God's commands are not too difficult (Deut. 30:11)
- Calendar must be observable by ordinary people without modern technology
- Must be accessible to all, including children

### CelestialAuthority
- Sun, moon, and stars are for signs, appointed times, days, and years (Gen. 1:14)
- These lights are the "hands on God's celestial clock"
- Calendar must remain synchronized with the heavens

### ObjectiveHolyTimes
- Appointed times are fixed and holy by divine decree
- Human failure to discern them doesn't alter their sanctity
- No process given for man to modify them

### CelestialStability
- Sun, moon, and stars have moved according to natural laws without supernatural interference
- **Note on "Exceptional Events"**: Events like Joshua's long day and Hezekiah's sign, when read in their ANE cultural/linguistic context, align with natural celestial movements (see Extra Chapter 04). Joshua's "sun stand still" is idiomatic for a celestial omen sign (full moon opposition), not a literal halt requiring supernatural physics. This strengthens CelestialStability rather than requiring exceptions.
- **Validated by AstronomicalStability**: This is not merely an assumption but is proven by verified retrocalculations of ancient celestial events (see Extra Chapter 04 and AstronomicalStability)
- This validation is necessary for:
  - Historical tests using astronomical calculations (ExodusCalendarTest, JordanCrossingTest, Crucifixion32ADTest, TempleDestructionTest)
  - Backward calculation from modern dates (eclipse dates, etc.)
  - Using NASA astronomical data for verification
  - Any chronological reconstruction based on celestial observations
- **Rationale**: Modern astronomical software (Stellarium, NASA JPL ephemerides) can accurately retrocalculate celestial events back 5,000+ years, confirming that celestial movements have followed natural laws. If movements were regularly supernaturally altered, these retrocalculations would fail to match historical records. The extensive verification of ancient eclipses and planetary positions (AstronomicalStability) proves the stability of astronomical calculations over millennia.
- **Dependencies**: AstronomicalStability (validates this assumption with empirical evidence)

## LEVEL 3: SCRIPTURAL INTERPRETATIONS (Depend on ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples, etc.)

### MonthStartsWithFullMoon
- **Fact**: Renewed moon = full moon
- **Evidence**: 
  - **Primary**: Psalm 81:3 (ḥodesh = keseh, poetic parallelism - direct equation)
  - Genesis 1:16 (moon must "govern at night with the stars" - only full moon visible all night)
  - Psalms 136:8-9 (moon and stars rule night together)
  - Two or three witnesses requirement (Deuteronomy 19:15 - full moon + stars provide concurrent testimony)
  - Ḥāḏaš root (renewal = restoration to perfection/wholeness - only full moon embodies this)
  - 15 independent lines of scriptural evidence (summary in fulltext.md lines 2527-2537)
  - Sirach 43:6-8 (Second Temple period evidence - "sign of feasts" linked to moon's "perfection/fullness")
- **Rejected Alternatives**: 
  - SliverMoonMonthStart (Sliver/Crescent moon) - violates "great light" requirement, lacks canonical evidence, hemispheric visibility issues
  - DarkMoonMonthStart (Dark moon/Conjunction) - not a light, ambiguous (2-3 days invisible), requires calculation not observation
- **Dependencies**: ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples, CalendarAccessibility, CelestialAuthority
- **Confidence**: Very High (15 independent lines of evidence, ancient support from Sirach)

### DayStartsAtMorning
- **Fact**: Day begins at dawn/first light
- **Evidence**: Multiple scriptural passages
- **Dependencies**: ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples
- **Confidence**: High

### FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th
- **Fact**: First Fruits offering on 16th of first month
- **Sources**: 
  - Septuagint (LXX)
  - Josephus (Antiquities 3.10.5)
  - Philo (On Special Laws 2.28.162)
  - Joshua 5:10-12
  - Exodus narrative
- **Dependencies**: ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples
- **Confidence**: Very High (multiple independent sources)

### FirstFruitsIsFirstDayOfWeek
- **Fact**: 16th = first day of week (Sunday equivalent)
- **Evidence**: 
  - **Primary**: Leviticus 23:15-16 requires counting from First Fruits (day after Sabbath) for 7 complete sabbaths, ending on "day after the 7th sabbath". Under continuous cycle assumption, this mathematical requirement means First Fruits must be on the first day of the week for the count to work correctly.
  - **Confirmations**: 
    - Joshua 5:10-12 (ate produce on 16th after manna ceased)
    - Resurrection on First Fruits = first day of week
- **Dependencies**: FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th, ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples
- **Confidence**: High
- **Note**: This is a scriptural requirement (not an assumption), which creates the paradox in FirstFruitsParadox when combined with FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th (First Fruits always on 16th)

### Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths
- **Fact**: 15th of both 1st and 2nd month were Sabbaths
- **Evidence**: 
  - Exodus: 15th of 1st month (Passover night)
  - Exodus: 15th of 2nd month (manna narrative)
  - FirstFruitsIsFirstDayOfWeek (16th = first day, so 15th = Sabbath)
  - **Additional**: Exodus travel/typology: Even if assuming alternative theory (First Fruits = first Sunday after Passover), the Exodus narrative shows they camped on 16th when "first fruits" typology is introduced (Exodus 12:37, 13:2; Numbers 33:5). If 16th is First Fruits (Sunday), then 15th must be Sabbath. This contradicts continuous cycle regardless of whether First Fruits is always on 16th or variable.
- **Dependencies**: FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th, FirstFruitsIsFirstDayOfWeek, ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples
- **Confidence**: High
- **Note**: Mathematically impossible with continuous 7-day cycle. The Exodus evidence works even under alternative First Fruits theories.

### FirstFruitsParadox
- **Fact**: Counting 7 weeks from 16th doesn't land on "day after 7th Sabbath" with continuous cycle
- **Evidence**: 
  - Leviticus 23:15-16 (scriptural requirement)
  - FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th (First Fruits always on 16th)
  - In 6 of 7 years, doesn't work with continuous cycle
- **Dependencies**: FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th, ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples
- **Confidence**: High
- **Note**: **Independent evidence for lunar sabbath** - does not assume lunar sabbath to prove it. The scriptural requirement (Leviticus 23:15-16) combined with historical fact (FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th) creates a mathematical contradiction that refutes continuous cycle.

---

## LEVEL 4: CALENDAR SYSTEM CONCLUSIONS (Depend on Scriptural facts + Crucifixion32AD)

### LunarSabbathSystem
- **Fact**: Sabbaths on 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th of each month
- **Evidence**: 
  - Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths (consecutive 15ths as Sabbaths - impossible with continuous cycle)
  - FirstFruitsParadox (First Fruits paradox resolved by lunar weeks)
  - MonthStartsWithFullMoon (month starts with full moon)
  - Crucifixion32AD (32 AD crucifixion compatible with lunar Sabbath, not Saturday)
- **Dependencies**: MonthStartsWithFullMoon, Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths, FirstFruitsParadox, Crucifixion32AD
- **Confidence**: Very High

### MovingCelestialDateline
- **Fact**: Dateline moves monthly based on first observation of new month sign
- **Evidence**: 
  - CalendarAccessibility (accessibility principle)
  - CelestialAuthority (celestial authority)
  - Fixed dateline requires modern technology (violates CalendarAccessibility)
- **Dependencies**: CalendarAccessibility, CelestialAuthority, MonthStartsWithFullMoon
- **Confidence**: High

### SaturdaySabbathIsPagan
- **Fact**: Continuous 7-day planetary week is of pagan origin
- **Evidence**: 
  - Dio Cassius: Egyptians invented planetary week
  - Pliny the Elder: Egyptians first to divide week into 7 days
  - Tibullus: Saturn's day mentioned (27-19 BCE)
  - Tacitus: Jews honor Saturn
  - Acts 7:43: Star of Remphan (Saturn)
- **Dependencies**: Historical sources
- **Confidence**: High

## DEPENDENCY SUMMARY

### Most Critical Paths:

**Path 1: 32 AD Crucifixion**
ScripturalAuthority, CelestialStability, AstronomicalStability → Tiberius15thYear → YearOfRelease29AD → Crucifixion32AD
ScripturalAuthority, CelestialStability, AstronomicalStability → SolomonsTempleConstruction → ExodusDate → JordanCrossing → SabbaticalYearCycleStart → YearOfRelease29AD → Crucifixion32AD
ScripturalAuthority, CelestialStability, AstronomicalStability → PompeysCapture → HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem → HerodsDeath → TempleConstructionTimeline → ThreePassoversInJohn → Crucifixion32AD
  - CelestialStability validated by AstronomicalStability (astronomical calculation stability proven by 5,000+ years of verified retrocalculations)
  - CelestialStability/AstronomicalStability required for NebuchadnezzarReignDates (astronomical records), January1BCEclipse (eclipse calculation), and historical calendar tests

**Path 1c: Sabbatical/Jubilee Cycle Validation (supports SabbaticalYearCycleStart)**
JordanCrossing → SabbaticalYearCycleStart (primary: 1406 BC start)
SabbaticalYearConfirmation → SabbaticalYearCycleStart (35 BC confirmation)
SolomonsTempleConstruction → JubileeCycleAlignment (965 BC jubilee alignment)
JubileeCycleAlignment (672 BC, 573 BC, 35 BC alignments) → SabbaticalYearCycleStart (additional confirmation)

**Path 1a: 36 BC Capture of Jerusalem (supports HerodsDeath)**
PompeysCapture → HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (primary: 27 years "to the day" - most emphatic)
PompeysCapture → ConsulshipReference (consulship reference - requires interpretation)
OlympiadReference (Olympiad reference - independent, fits both dates)
JordanCrossing → SabbaticalYearCycleStart → SabbaticalYearConfirmation (sabbatical year confirmation - strong support)
SpringToSpringReckoning (reckoning convention - independent, supports 36 BC)
HerodsAppointmentDate (appointment date - can be established from Appian/Dio Cassius independently)
  - Journey timeline evidence (shipwreck, refitting, winter) - direct from Josephus
  - Consular reference interpretation (marks journey start, not appointment)
  - MonthStartsWithFullMoon enhances HerodsAppointmentDate (makes timeline more probable) but not required
107YearsHighPriests (107 years calculation - approximate, supports 36 BC)
HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem + HerodsDeath → RegnalYearSpanTest (regnal span test - validates both HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem and HerodsDeath)
ResolutionOfContradictions (resolution of contradictions - methodological support)
HerodsAppointmentDate → HerodsRegnalYearsStart → BattleOfActium (Battle of Actium - independent test of regnal years, supports 38 BC regnal start)

**Path 1b: Herod's Death (1 BC) - Multiple Independent Lines**
January1BCEclipse (eclipse) → HerodsDeath (primary)
HerodsAgeAtAppointment → HerodsBirthYear → HerodsDeath (age calculation - primary)
PompeysCapture → HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem → HerodsDeath (capture + reign length - primary)
RegnalYearSpanTest → HerodsDeath (regnal span test - primary)
PhilipsDeath22ndYear → HerodsDeath (Philip's reign - supporting, aligns with 1 BC)
PhilipsDeath20thYear → contradicts HerodsDeath (would require 4 BC, but conflicts with January1BCEclipse, HerodsBirthYear, HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem, RegnalYearSpanTest)

**Path 1d: Birth Date Calculation & Mutual Reinforcement**
Tiberius15thYear (Tiberius 15th year = fall 28-29 AD) → John's ministry start
  → + Luke 3:23 (Jesus "about 30" at baptism) → Jesus' birth ~2 BC
  → + Luke 1:36 (Jesus 6 months younger than John) → John's birth ~2 BC
  → + AugustusCensus (census 2 BC) → **supports** HerodsDeath (Herod's death 1 BC, not 4 BC)
  
**Mutual Reinforcement (Not Circular Dependency)**:
- **Tiberius15thYear → HerodsDeath**: Birth dates calculated from Tiberius15thYear support Herod's death in 1 BC (not 4 BC)
- **HerodsDeath → Tiberius15thYear**: Herod's death in 1 BC validates timeline that makes Tiberius15thYear's implications work
- **Tiberius15thYear → Crucifixion32AD**: Direct support for 32 AD crucifixion (independent of HerodsDeath)
- **HerodsDeath → TempleConstructionTimeline, ThreePassoversInJohn, Crucifixion32AD**: Herod's death supports temple timeline and Passovers

**Why This Is NOT Circular**:
1. **Tiberius15thYear is independently established**: Roman historiography (Tacitus, Suetonius, Dio Cassius) - doesn't depend on HerodsDeath
2. **HerodsDeath is independently established**: January1BCEclipse (eclipse), HerodsBirthYear (age), HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (capture), RegnalYearSpanTest (regnal span) - doesn't depend on Tiberius15thYear
3. **Mutual reinforcement**: They converge and validate each other, but each can stand alone
4. **Convergence strengthens confidence**: When independent lines agree, confidence increases (not circular reasoning)

**Path 2: Lunar Sabbath**
ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples, CalendarAccessibility, CelestialAuthority → MonthStartsWithFullMoon → LunarSabbathSystem
  - MonthStartsWithFullMoon rejects SliverMoonMonthStart (Sliver Moon) and DarkMoonMonthStart (Dark Moon)
ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples → FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th → FirstFruitsIsFirstDayOfWeek → Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths → LunarSabbathSystem
ScripturalAuthority, HermeneuticalPrinciples → FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th → FirstFruitsParadox → LunarSabbathSystem

**Path 3: Validation**
CelestialStability, AstronomicalStability → ExodusCalendarTest, JordanCrossingTest, Crucifixion32ADTest, TempleDestructionTest (celestial movements not supernaturally interfered with - validated by AstronomicalStability; necessary for all historical calendar tests)
LunarSabbathSystem + Crucifixion32AD → Crucifixion32ADTest (strongest validation)
LunarSabbathSystem + ExodusDate/JordanCrossing → ExodusCalendarTest/JordanCrossingTest (independent validation)

**Appointment40BC (40 BC Appointment)** → Capture37BC (37 BC Capture) → HerodsDeath4BC (4 BC Death) → RegnalStart40BC (40 BC Regnal Start)
**PhilipsDeath20thYear (Greek MSS 20th Year)** → HerodsDeath4BC (4 BC Death)
**VariableFirstFruits (Variable First Fruits)** → ContinuousWeek (Continuous Week) - both attempt to resolve paradoxes
**ContinuousWeek (Continuous Week)** - independent alternative to LunarSabbathSystem
**SliverMoonMonthStart (Sliver Moon)** - independent alternative to MonthStartsWithFullMoon
**DarkMoonMonthStart (Dark Moon)** - independent alternative to MonthStartsWithFullMoon

### Foundational Assumptions Status:
- **CelestialStability (Celestial Movements)**: Now **validated by AstronomicalStability** - not merely an assumption but proven by 5,000+ years of verified retrocalculations. This strengthens all dependent facts (NebuchadnezzarReignDates, January1BCEclipse, ExodusCalendarTest-TempleDestructionTest, March4BCEclipse).

### Weakest Links (highest risk if wrong):
1. **Tiberius15thYear (Tiberius 15th year)** - If Luke used non-standard dating, Crucifixion32AD collapses
2. **HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (36 BC capture)** - If 37 BC (Capture37BC), then HerodsDeath shifts to 2 BC, affecting TempleConstructionTimeline, ThreePassoversInJohn, Crucifixion32AD
   - However, HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem has 9 independent supporting lines (ConsulshipReference-BattleOfActium)
   - Strongest: HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (27 years "to the day") + SabbaticalYearConfirmation (sabbatical year) + RegnalYearSpanTest (regnal span) + BattleOfActium (Battle of Actium)
   - Capture37BC (37 BC) has weaker evidence, contradicted by most emphatic marker
3. **MonthStartsWithFullMoon (Full moon month start)** - If wrong, entire calendar system changes, affects HerodsAppointmentDate
   - However, MonthStartsWithFullMoon has 15 independent lines of scriptural evidence
   - SliverMoonMonthStart (Sliver moon) and DarkMoonMonthStart (Dark moon) both violate fundamental scriptural requirements (not a "great light", not observable, ambiguous)
   - MonthStartsWithFullMoon has ancient support (Sirach 43:6-8 from Second Temple period)
4. **FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th (First Fruits on 16th)** - If variable (VariableFirstFruits), Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths and FirstFruitsParadox arguments weaken
   - However, VariableFirstFruits rejected by historical tests (1446 BC, 1406 BC, 32 AD)

### Additional Supporting Evidence:

**JubileeCycleAlignment (Jubilee Alignments)** - Provides 4 independent confirmations:
- 965 BC: Exact jubilee year (year 1 of cycle 10)
- 672 BC: Year 49 of jubilee (7th year of 7th sabbatical)
- 573 BC: Exact jubilee year (year 1 of cycle 18)
- 35 BC: Year 49 of jubilee (7th year of 7th sabbatical, confirmed by Josephus)

These alignments support SabbaticalYearCycleStart (sabbatical cycle start) independently of SabbaticalYearConfirmation, though SabbaticalYearConfirmation provides the strongest direct confirmation.

### Rejected Alternatives Summary:

**March4BCEclipse-HerodsDeath4BC-RegnalStart40BC-SliverMoonMonthStart-DarkMoonMonthStart** represent alternative facts that have been evaluated and rejected:
- **March4BCEclipse, HerodsDeath4BC, PhilipsDeath20thYear, RegnalStart40BC**: 4 BC chronology alternatives (rejected by January1BCEclipse, HerodsBirthYear, HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem, HerodsDeath, PhilipsDeath22ndYear, BattleOfActium)
- **VariableFirstFruits, ContinuousWeek**: Calendar system alternatives (rejected by FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th, Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths, FirstFruitsParadox, ExodusCalendarTest-Crucifixion32ADTest)
- **Appointment40BC, Capture37BC**: Chronology alternatives (rejected by HerodsAppointmentDate, HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem, BattleOfActium)
- **SliverMoonMonthStart, DarkMoonMonthStart**: Month start alternatives (rejected by MonthStartsWithFullMoon - sliver moon and dark moon violate scriptural requirements)

All rejected alternatives are tracked for dependency analysis - some arguments (like 4BC consensus, traditional calendars) build upon these rejected facts, which is why they're included in the dependency tree.

### Strongest Multi-Witness Facts:
1. **HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (36 BC capture)** - Has 9 independent supporting lines:
   - **HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem**: Primary calculation (27 years "to the day" - most emphatic)
   - **SabbaticalYearConfirmation**: Sabbatical year confirmation (from SabbaticalYearCycleStart - strong)
   - **RegnalYearSpanTest**: Regnal span test (with HerodsDeath - validates both)
   - **SpringToSpringReckoning**: Reckoning convention (supports 36 BC over 37 BC)
   - **HerodsAppointmentDate**: Appointment date (39 BC + 3 years = 36 BC)
     - Can be established from Appian/Dio Cassius independently
     - Journey timeline evidence (shipwreck, refitting, winter) - direct from Josephus
     - Consular reference interpretation (marks journey start, not appointment)
     - MonthStartsWithFullMoon enhances HerodsAppointmentDate (makes timeline more probable) but not required
   - **107YearsHighPriests**: 107 years calculation (approximate but supports 36 BC)
   - **BattleOfActium**: Battle of Actium (independent test of regnal years - supports 38 BC regnal start, which confirms 39 BC appointment)
   - **ConsulshipReference, OlympiadReference**: Consulship/Olympiad (require interpretation but don't contradict)
   - **ResolutionOfContradictions**: Resolution methodology (preserves emphatic claims)
2. **HerodsDeath (1 BC death)** - Has 4 primary independent lines + supporting evidence:
   - January1BCEclipse (eclipse - January 10, 1 BC) - **primary**
   - HerodsBirthYear (age calculation: 70 years from birth) - **primary**
   - HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem (capture 36 BC + 34 years) - **primary**
   - RegnalYearSpanTest (regnal span test - cross-validates with HerodsCaptureOfJerusalem) - **primary**
   - PhilipsDeath22ndYear (Philip's reign: 37 years from 1 BC = AD 35/36) - **supporting, aligns**
   - PhilipsDeath20thYear (Philip's reign: 37 years from 4 BC = AD 33/34) - **contradicts, requires special pleading**

### Strongest Independent Validations:
1. **AstronomicalStability (Astronomical Calculation Stability)** - Validates CelestialStability with empirical evidence from 5,000+ years of verified retrocalculations. Proves celestial movements have followed natural laws, making all astronomical calculations (NebuchadnezzarReignDates, January1BCEclipse, ExodusCalendarTest-TempleDestructionTest) reliable. Independent of all other facts.
2. **Consecutive15thsAsSabbaths (Consecutive 15ths)** - Independent of Crucifixion32AD, works with any Exodus date. Even works under alternative First Fruits theories (Exodus travel/typology evidence).
3. **FirstFruitsParadox (First Fruits Paradox)** - Independent of dating, pure calendar math. **Does not assume lunar sabbath to prove it** - uses scriptural requirement (Leviticus 23:15-16) + historical fact (FirstFruitsAlwaysOn16th) to create contradiction that refutes continuous cycle.
4. **ExodusCalendarTest/JordanCrossingTest (Exodus/Jordan tests)** - Independent of Crucifixion32AD, test calendar directly (validated by CelestialStability/AstronomicalStability)
