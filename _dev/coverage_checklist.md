# Coverage Checklist: 4BC Facts Tree Analysis vs. Book's Dependency Tree

**Last Updated**: After adding Extra Chapters 02 (Battle of Actium) and 03 (Herod's Appointment)

## ✅ FULLY COVERED

### 1. Herod's Death Date (1 BC vs 4 BC)
- ✅ **H13**: Herod's death 1 BC with 4 primary lines of evidence
- ✅ **H5**: January 10, 1 BC total eclipse (explicitly stated)
- ✅ **H11**: Age calculation (15 years old → 70 at death)
- ✅ **H12 + H12g**: Capture + 34 years = 1 BC
- ✅ **H8a vs H8b**: Both manuscript readings documented, H8b preferred
- ⚠️ **Gap**: March 13, 4 BC partial eclipse mentioned in book but not explicitly rejected in dependency tree

### 2. Capture of Jerusalem (36 BC vs 37 BC)
- ✅ **H12**: Primary evidence (27 years "to the day")
- ✅ **H12a**: Consulship reference (37 BC) - addressed
- ✅ **H12b**: 185th Olympiad - addressed

- ✅ **S5**: Consecutive 15ths as Sabbaths
- ✅ **S6**: First Fruits paradox (refutes continuous cycle)
- ⚠️ **Gap**: Variable First Fruits theory (first Sunday after Passover) mentioned in book but not explicitly addressed as rejected alternative in dependency tree

### 5. Calendar System (Lunar Sabbath vs Continuous)
- ✅ **S1**: Month starts with full moon
- ✅ **S2**: Day starts at morning
- ✅ **C1**: Lunar Sabbath system
- ✅ **S5**: Consecutive 15ths (proves lunar sabbath)
- ✅ **S6**: First Fruits paradox (refutes continuous cycle)
- ✅ **V1, V2, V3**: Historical tests (Exodus, Jordan, 32 AD) - all test continuous cycle and show it fails
- ⚠️ **Gap**: Continuous week assumption (H12 in 4BC tree) not explicitly addressed as rejected alternative

### 6. Herod's Age
- ✅ **H7**: 15 years old at appointment (55/54 BC)
- ✅ **H11**: Birth year calculation (~70/69 BC)

## ⚠️ PARTIALLY COVERED / IMPLICIT

### 1. March 13, 4 BC Eclipse
- **Status**: ✅ **Book explicitly mentions it** (fulltext.md line 3902): "faint partial eclipse of 4 BC that is usually cited, an eclipse which happened at 3 AM when few would notice it"
- **Status**: ✅ **Book explicitly compares timelines**: "29 days" vs "114 days" (implicit in narrative)
- **Coverage**: Implicitly rejected by H5 (1 BC eclipse) and H13 (1 BC death)
- **Dependency Tree**: H5 and H13 don't explicitly state "4 BC eclipse rejected because..."
- **Recommendation**: Could add explicit note in H5 or H13 about why 4 BC eclipse is rejected, but **information is NOT missing** - it's in the book, just not explicitly labeled as "rejected alternative" in dependency tree

### 2. Variable First Fruits Theory
- **Status**: ✅ **Book explicitly refutes it** (fulltext.md line 3144): "The only way to escape this paradox is if first fruits is not always on the 16th but is the first Sunday after Passover and this is many people attempt to resolve it. But we have already seen how that breaks down with historical narratives in 1446 BC, 1406 BC, and 32 AD."
- **Coverage**: Implicitly rejected by S3 (always on 16th) and S6 (paradox)
- **Dependency Tree**: S3 and S6 don't explicitly state "variable theory rejected because..."
- **Recommendation**: Could add explicit note in S3 or S6 about variable theory being rejected, but **information is NOT missing** - it's in the book, just not explicitly labeled as "rejected alternative" in dependency tree

### 3. Continuous Week / Saturday Sabbath
- **Status**: ✅ **Book refutes it throughout** (S5, S6, V1, V2, V3 all test continuous cycle and show it fails)
- **Status**: ✅ **Book addresses Dead Sea Scrolls** (fulltext.md line 3531): "Dead Sea Scroll calendar which has a continuous weekly cycle; but this cycle is based upon a 364 day solar calendar. In order to keep synced with the weekly cycle they have to insert an undocumented week every 7 or so years."
- **Status**: ✅ **Book addresses Josephus "Saturn's day"** (fulltext.md lines 3380-3450): Extensive discussion of planetary week, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Acts 7:43
- **Coverage**: Implicitly rejected by S5, S6, C1, V1, V2, V3
- **Dependency Tree**: C1 doesn't explicitly state "continuous week rejected because..."
- **Recommendation**: Could add explicit note in C1 or create a "Rejected Alternatives" section, but **most information is NOT missing** - it's in the book, just not explicitly labeled as "rejected alternative" in dependency tree

### 4. 37 BC Capture Alternative
- **Status**: Well covered in H12a, H12b, H12g, H12h
- **Coverage**: Explicitly addressed and tested
- **Status**: ✅ Fully covered

---

## ❌ NOT EXPLICITLY COVERED IN DEPENDENCY TREE (But Covered in Book)

### 1. 4 BC Eclipse Details
- **Book Coverage**: ✅ Explicitly stated (fulltext.md line 3902)
- **Dependency Tree**: ⚠️ Not explicitly listed as rejected alternative
- **Status**: Information is in book, just not structured as "R1. 4 BC Eclipse (Rejected)" in dependency tree

### 2. Variable First Fruits as Rejected Alternative
- **Book Coverage**: ✅ Explicitly rejected (fulltext.md line 3144)
- **Dependency Tree**: ⚠️ Not explicitly listed as rejected alternative
- **Status**: Information is in book, just not structured as "R2. Variable First Fruits (Rejected)" in dependency tree

### 3. Continuous Week as Rejected Alternative
- **Book Coverage**: ✅ Extensively refuted throughout (S5, S6, V1, V2, V3, Dead Sea Scrolls discussion, planetary week discussion)
- **Dependency Tree**: ⚠️ Not explicitly listed as rejected alternative
- **Status**: Information is in book, just not structured as "R3. Continuous Week (Rejected)" in dependency tree

## ❌ TRULY MISSING (Not in Book or Dependency Tree)

### 1. Modern Theory / White Supremacist Ties
- **Status**: ✅ **ADDRESSED** (fulltext.md lines 268, 276, 2365-2395)
- **Book's Coverage**: 
  - **Ad Hominem Pattern**: Book addresses how "any researcher who challenges the assumption is ignored" (line 276) and how people "impugn the credibility of their primary witnesses" when evidence doesn't fit (line 268) - identifying this as ad hominem dismissal pattern
  - **Ancient Evidence Refutes "Modern Theory"**: Book provides Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) as Second Temple period evidence (lines 2365-2395) showing full-moon calendar was "plausibly known tradition during the Second Temple period" - refutes claim that lunar Sabbath is a modern 1990s theory
  - **Book states**: "The existence of a text like Sirach counters the mainstream assertion that the full-moon calendar is a radical, fringe idea. It was a plausibly known tradition during the Second Temple period"
  - **White Supremacist Claims**: Book addresses ad hominem dismissal pattern (ignoring/dismissing challengers) which includes character attacks like white supremacist claims
- **Conclusion**: Book addresses both the ad hominem dismissal pattern and provides ancient evidence (Sirach) that refutes the "modern theory" claim. **No gap.**

### 2. NASA Eclipse Data Specifics
- **Status**: ⚠️ Book mentions "faint partial" but doesn't cite specific NASA metrics (138 min, 36% obscured, 1:30-3:50 AM)
- **Gap**: Should cite NASA data directly for both eclipses for comparison
- **Priority**: MODERATE

### 3. Copy Error Theories for Manuscripts
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT addressed in book**
- **Gap**: Grok's claim about 1544 Greek edition or copy error theories for Latin variants
- **Priority**: MODERATE

### 4. Sabbatical Cycle from Maccabees
- **Status**: ❌ **NOT addressed in book**
- **Gap**: Grok's alternative calculation using 163/162 BC Maccabees cycle
- **Priority**: MODERATE

### 5. Ancient Debate (Sadducees vs. Pharisees)
- **Status**: ⚠️ Book mentions Sadducees but doesn't address the specific debate about First Fruits
- **Gap**: Should address Grok's claim about ancient debate and which view prevailed
- **Priority**: MODERATE

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Rationale for Adding "Rejected Alternatives" to Dependency Tree

**Question**: Should we add a "REJECTED ALTERNATIVES" section to the fact dependency tree?

**Answer**: It depends on the purpose of the dependency tree:

1. **If the dependency tree is for internal analysis** (tracking what the book covers):
   - **Current structure is sufficient** - rejected alternatives are implicit in the positive evidence
   - Adding explicit rejections would make the tree longer without adding analytical value
   - The book already covers these rejections explicitly

2. **If the dependency tree is for external readers** (showing what arguments the book addresses):
   - **Adding explicit rejections would be helpful** - makes it clear the book addresses common counter-arguments
   - Shows comprehensiveness of the book's argumentation
   - Helps readers quickly see "does the book address X alternative?"

3. **If the dependency tree is for identifying gaps** (what's missing):
   - **Explicit rejections help identify gaps** - if a common alternative isn't listed, it's a gap
   - Makes it easier to see what the book doesn't address

### Option 1: Add Explicit Rejected Alternatives Section
**Rationale**: Makes it explicit what alternatives the book rejects, improving clarity for external readers and gap identification.

**Structure**: Add after LEVEL 4 (Calendar Conclusions) or in NOTES:

```markdown
## REJECTED ALTERNATIVES

### R1. March 13, 4 BC Partial Eclipse
- **Claim**: Partial eclipse before Herod's death
- **Rejection**: Faint partial at 3 AM "when few would notice it" (fulltext.md line 3902)
- **Timeline**: Only 29 days to Passover (too short for Josephus's narrative)
- **Alternative**: H5 (January 10, 1 BC total eclipse) provides 114 days
- **Dependencies**: H5, H13
- **Book Reference**: Explicitly addressed in main text

### R2. Variable First Fruits (First Sunday After Passover)
- **Claim**: First Fruits = first Sunday after Passover (not always on 16th)
- **Rejection**: "Breaks down with historical narratives in 1446 BC, 1406 BC, and 32 AD" (fulltext.md line 3144)
- **Evidence**: S3 (always on 16th), S6 (paradox only works if always on 16th)
- **Dependencies**: S3, S6
- **Book Reference**: Explicitly addressed in main text

### R3. Continuous 7-Day Week (Saturday Sabbath)
- **Claim**: Sabbath every 7th day, independent of moon
- **Rejection**: 
  - S5: Consecutive 15ths impossible with continuous cycle
  - S6: First Fruits paradox refutes continuous cycle
  - V1, V2, V3: Historical tests fail with continuous cycle
  - Dead Sea Scrolls: 364-day calendar requires undocumented week insertions
  - Planetary week: Pagan origin (Dio Cassius, Tacitus, Acts 7:43)
- **Alternative**: C1 (Lunar Sabbath system)
- **Dependencies**: S5, S6, C1, V1, V2, V3
- **Book Reference**: Extensively addressed throughout
```

**Pros**: 
- Makes rejections explicit
- Shows comprehensiveness
- Helps identify gaps

**Cons**:
- Makes tree longer
- Information already in book
- May be redundant if tree is for internal use

### Option 2: Add Notes to Existing Facts
**Rationale**: Less structural change, but still makes rejections explicit.

Add explicit rejection notes to:
- **H5**: "Rejects March 13, 4 BC partial eclipse (faint, 3 AM, only 29 days to Passover)"
- **S3**: "Rejects variable First Fruits theory (breaks down with historical narratives)"
- **C1**: "Rejects continuous 7-day week (S5, S6, V1-V3 show it fails)"

**Pros**: Less disruptive, still explicit
**Cons**: Rejections scattered, harder to see all alternatives at once

### Option 3: Current State is Sufficient
**Rationale**: The dependency tree is for internal analysis, and rejected alternatives are implicit in the positive evidence structure.

**Current coverage**: 
- H5 + H13 = 1 BC eclipse and death (implicitly rejects 4 BC)
- S3 + S6 = Always on 16th + paradox (implicitly rejects variable)
- S5 + S6 + C1 = Lunar sabbath proofs (implicitly reject continuous)

**Pros**: Cleaner structure, information already in book
**Cons**: Not explicit for external readers, harder to identify gaps

### Recommendation

**For the fact dependency tree**: **Option 3 (Current State)** is sufficient if the tree is primarily for internal analysis. The book already explicitly covers these rejections.

**For identifying gaps**: Use this coverage checklist (which we're updating) to track what's truly missing vs. what's just not explicitly structured as "rejected alternatives."

**For new chapters**: Focus on **truly missing** items (modern theory criticism, NASA data specifics, copy error theories, coin evidence, Maccabees cycle, ancient debate details) rather than restructuring existing coverage.

---

## CONCLUSION

**Answer: Almost all fact patterns are covered in the BOOK.** The dependency tree has:
- ✅ All major fact patterns from the analysis
- ✅ All key evidence lines
- ✅ All calculations and dependencies
- ⚠️ Implicit rejection of alternatives (explicitly covered in book, just not structured as "rejected alternatives" in dependency tree)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Information is NOT missing** - The book explicitly addresses 4 BC eclipse, variable First Fruits, and continuous week
2. **Structure could be clearer** - Dependency tree doesn't label these as "rejected alternatives" but they're implicit
3. **Truly missing items** - Modern theory criticism, NASA data specifics, copy error theories, coin evidence, Maccabees cycle, ancient debate details

**Recommendation:**
- **Don't restructure dependency tree** to add "rejected alternatives" section (information already there implicitly)
- **Do create new chapters** for truly missing items (Priority 1: Modern theory criticism, DSS continuous weeks)
- **Do enhance existing chapters** with missing details (Priority 2: NASA data, copy errors, coins, Maccabees, ancient debate)

The book's dependency tree is comprehensive and well-structured. The current structure clearly implies rejections through the positive evidence presented. The focus should be on addressing truly missing items rather than restructuring existing coverage.
