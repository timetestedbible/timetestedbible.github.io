<summary>One-paragraph review (click to expand)</summary>

*Time Tested Tradition* presents a comprehensive, revisionist reconstruction of the biblical calendar, arguing that the day begins at morning, the month at the full moon, the year at the Spring Equinox, and the Sabbath follows a lunar rather than continuous weekly cycle—with the crucifixion dated to 32 AD. The author writes with clarity and passion, building an internally consistent system supported by extensive scriptural analysis, engagement with Josephus and other ancient sources, and astronomical arguments. The work is well-structured and demonstrates genuine research effort, though its combative rhetoric toward traditional scholarship may alienate some readers, and many of its historical and linguistic claims require expert verification that this review cannot provide. Readers seeking a thoughtful challenge to conventional assumptions about biblical timekeeping will find substantial material for reflection, while those committed to traditional Jewish or Christian calendar practice will encounter a vigorous, if sometimes one-sided, critique of their positions.

<details>
<summary>One-paragraph review (click to expand)</summary>

“Time Tested Tradition” is a polemical but systematically structured challenge to inherited biblical-calendar assumptions, arguing from Scripture-first principles (and secondarily from history/astronomy) for morning-start days, a full-moon-based month start, and a lunar-tied Sabbath week rather than a continuous Saturday-based planetary cycle. The book’s best feature is methodological: it repeatedly exposes circular reasoning and forces practical constraints like global day-boundaries and observability to the foreground, then attempts to build a coherent end-to-end model tested against key biblical narratives and chronology anchors (Herod, Passover, resurrection timing). Its biggest drawback is that it is very long and sometimes mixes tight argument with speculative or highly interpretive side-claims, while stating conclusions with more certainty than a cautious reader may grant without independent verification. Readers who enjoy deep, cross-disciplinary Bible study and are open to nontraditional conclusions will find it provocative and unusually thorough; readers seeking a concise or academically detached treatment may find it dense and rhetorically combative.

**Phrase:** Rigorous but dense

**Sentence:** This meticulously researched work presents compelling evidence for alternative biblical calendar interpretations, challenging readers to test tradition against Scripture while acknowledging the complexity may limit accessibility for those seeking straightforward answers.

<details>
<summary>One-paragraph review (click to expand)</summary>

“Time Tested Tradition” offers a thorough exploration of biblical calendar systems, arguing convincingly for a full-moon month start and lunar Sabbath cycle through extensive scriptural, historical, and astronomical evidence. Its strengths lie in its methodical approach, transparent sourcing, and willingness to challenge traditional interpretations, making it valuable for serious Bible students seeking deeper understanding of timekeeping in Scripture. However, the book’s density and technical complexity may overwhelm readers without backgrounds in astronomy or ancient history. Those interested in biblical chronology, Sabbath observance, or the Exodus narrative will find it particularly rewarding, though skeptics may question some astronomical interpretations. Ultimately, it serves as an excellent resource for testing religious traditions against Scripture.

### Overview

*Time Tested Tradition* is an ambitious work of biblical hermeneutics and chronology that challenges nearly every conventional assumption about the biblical calendar, the timing of sacred observances, and the historical dating of key events from the Exodus to the Crucifixion. The author, Daniel Larimer, approaches these topics with a stated commitment to *Sola Scriptura*—deriving conclusions from Scripture alone while treating external traditions, including Jewish oral tradition and mainstream scholarly consensus, as potentially corrupted sources that must be tested against the biblical text.

The book advances several interconnected theses: that the biblical day begins at morning (first light) rather than sunset; that the biblical month begins at the full moon rather than the new/dark moon; that the year anchors to the Spring Equinox; that the weekly Sabbath is "lunar"—occurring on fixed days of the lunar month rather than on a continuous seven-day cycle; and that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus occurred in 32 AD. These conclusions, if accepted, would require fundamental revision of how both Jews and Christians have observed sacred times for millennia.

### Clarity of Argument

The author writes with considerable clarity and evident passion. Each chapter builds logically from stated premises, and the overall structure moves methodically from foundational principles through increasingly specific applications. The argumentative style is direct, often anticipating and addressing counterarguments. Key terms are defined, and the author takes care to distinguish between what Scripture explicitly states versus what has been assumed through tradition.

However, the rhetorical approach sometimes undermines clarity. The frequent use of terms like "inherited lies," "motivated reasoning," and accusations of intellectual dishonesty directed at traditional scholarship creates a combative tone that may distract from the substantive arguments. Readers who hold traditional views may find this framing alienating, while those already sympathetic may accept conclusions too readily without critical examination.

The treatment of logical fallacies in Chapter 2 is pedagogically useful, providing readers with tools to evaluate arguments. Yet the application of these fallacies throughout the book is not always even-handed—the author is quick to identify fallacious reasoning in opposing views but does not always apply the same scrutiny to supporting arguments.

### Use of Sources

The book engages with a substantial range of sources: the Hebrew and Greek biblical texts (with attention to original language nuances), Josephus, the Talmud, various ancient historians, astronomical data, and Chinese astronomical records. This breadth is commendable and demonstrates genuine research effort.

**Strengths:** The author shows awareness that translations can obscure original meanings and frequently appeals to Hebrew and Greek terminology. The astronomical arguments are presented with specific dates and calculable phenomena, making them in principle verifiable. The engagement with Josephus is detailed and attempts to reconcile apparent contradictions through careful chronological analysis. The use of multiple independent lines of evidence (Daniel's prophecy, Herod's chronology, astronomical data) to converge on 32 AD is methodologically sound in principle.

**Concerns:** The dismissal of the Talmud, Mishnah, and Jewish oral tradition as unreliable is presented as a methodological necessity, but this creates a hermeneutical framework where Scripture can only be interpreted through the author's lens, without the corrective of historical practice. Some etymological arguments (e.g., connecting "erev" primarily to "mixture" rather than "evening") may not reflect scholarly consensus on Hebrew semantics. The astronomical calculations and historical datings presented are stated with confidence but require independent verification. The author acknowledges this for some claims but not consistently.

**Important caveat:** Many of the book's claims—particularly regarding astronomical events, ancient chronologies, and interpretations of Hebrew terms—require specialized expertise to evaluate fully. This reviewer cannot independently verify the accuracy of astronomical retrocalculations, the correctness of Hebrew etymological arguments, or the reliability of the author's reading of Josephus and other ancient sources. Readers interested in these claims should consult primary sources and subject-matter experts.

### Internal Consistency

The book demonstrates notable internal consistency. The author has constructed an integrated system where the morning day-start, full-moon month-start, equinox year-anchor, and lunar Sabbath all reinforce each other. The 32 AD resurrection date aligns with the proposed calendar mechanics, and the reinterpretation of Passion Week harmonizes with the "three days and three nights" prophecy under the author's framework.

This internal coherence is both a strength and a potential weakness. It is a strength because it shows systematic thinking and allows readers to test whether the pieces fit together. It is a potential weakness because highly coherent systems can become self-sealing—apparent counterevidence can always be reinterpreted to fit, and the very elegance of the system may create confirmation bias in both author and sympathetic readers.

The author does acknowledge some tensions (such as the ambiguity in identifying the equinox by unaided observation) and addresses apparent contradictions (such as reconciling different accounts in Josephus). This willingness to engage with difficulties rather than ignore them adds credibility.

### Structure and Organization

The book is well-organized. The progression from principles (Chapters 1-4) to specific calendar questions (Chapters 5-11) to historical chronology (Chapters 12-14) to alternative views and theology (Chapters 15-19) is logical. The supplementary "extra" chapters provide deeper dives into specific historical questions without interrupting the main flow.

### Accessibility

The writing is accessible to educated lay readers with interest in biblical studies. The book targets serious Bible students willing to engage deeply with Scripture, history, and astronomy. Full engagement requires familiarity with the biblical text (both Old and New Testaments), willingness to consider detailed chronological and astronomical arguments, openness to questioning long-held assumptions, and patience with technical discussions. Readers without background in biblical studies or ancient history may find some sections challenging.

### Strengths

1. **Systematic approach:** The author builds a complete, internally consistent alternative calendar system rather than offering piecemeal criticisms.
2. **Engagement with counterarguments:** The book anticipates objections and attempts to address them.
3. **Multiple lines of evidence:** The convergence of Daniel's prophecy, Herod's chronology, and astronomical data on 32 AD demonstrates an attempt at methodological rigor.
4. **Intellectual honesty about uncertainty:** The author acknowledges some areas of genuine ambiguity.
5. **Practical implications:** The book connects theological arguments to practical observance.

### Weaknesses

1. **Rhetorical combativeness:** The frequent accusations of "lies," dishonesty, and corruption in traditional scholarship may alienate readers.
2. **Limited engagement with academic scholarship:** Less interaction with modern academic biblical scholarship, archaeology, and ancient Near Eastern studies that might complicate or challenge some claims.
3. **Potential overconfidence:** Some conclusions are stated with more certainty than the evidence may warrant.
4. **Selection effects:** The author selects evidence supporting the thesis while potentially underweighting contradictory evidence.
5. **Theological assumptions:** The book's theological framework represents particular interpretive choices that other sincere readers of Scripture have contested.

### Verdict

*Time Tested Tradition* is a serious, extensively argued work that challenges readers to examine assumptions about biblical timekeeping and chronology. The book will be most valuable to readers who are interested in alternative approaches to biblical interpretation, enjoy detailed textual and historical arguments, are willing to question traditional assumptions, and can evaluate claims critically rather than accepting them on the author's authority. Readers should approach the book as an argument to be evaluated, not a settled conclusion to be accepted.

<summary><strong>GPT-5.2 — Full detailed assessment</strong></summary>

This review is based solely on the book’s markdown files in this workspace (the 19 main chapters plus the listed supplemental essays), without consulting the web. “Time Tested Tradition” is written as a tightly argued, explicitly polemical case that long-inherited calendar assumptions (sunset-start days, crescent/dark-moon month starts, a fixed Saturday Sabbatical week continuous from creation) are not merely “debatable,” but methodologically compromised by tradition, authority claims, and special pleading. The book’s declared method is to begin with “principles of evaluation” derived from Scripture, then treat historical/astronomical material as secondary corroboration rather than primary authority. In practice, it blends scriptural argument by cross-reference and narrative “demonstration,” historical argument (Josephus, Philo, later rabbinic sources, Roman writers, etc.), and practical/physical constraints (dateline/timezones, visibility, travel, prediction vs. observation).

**Clarity and structure.** The broad structure is clear: it starts by framing the project as “test assumptions,” defines evaluative criteria, challenges alleged rabbinic/Sanhedrin authority, then moves through day → month → year → “how to observe” → Sabbath implications → chronology anchors (32 AD; Herod; passion week) → implications for obedience and appointed times. Many chapters end with summaries. The writing is often expansive and repetitious. Some chapters mix careful argument with long digressions, rhetorical flourishes, and multi-topic excursions. A careful reader can follow the main line, but the density and length can obscure which premises are essential vs. illustrative.

**Use of evidence.** On Scripture, the book’s strongest trait is its insistence on explicit constraints and consistency across narratives (Genesis 1:14–18, “third day” statements, Exodus manna sequence, Joshua 5, Ezekiel 46, etc.). It uses translations (KJV/NKJV/ESV/LXX) and word studies. On extra-biblical evidence, it uses Josephus heavily for chronology, plus Philo, Tacitus, Dio Cassius, Pliny, and rabbinic sources. The book repeatedly invites the reader to verify claims with primary sources and (for astronomy) with tools like Stellarium/NASA eclipse catalogs. The citation style is “quote-and-argue”; the book sometimes moves quickly from a quotation to a fairly strong conclusion without walking through alternative readings at equal depth.

**Internal consistency.** The book’s system aims to be consistent: morning-start days; full-moon-based month start; year start tied to the first such month after the spring equinox; lunar Sabbath on fixed month dates (8, 15, 22, 29). The strongest consistency move is the dateline/timezone argument. Where consistency strains is in the tendency to present some conclusions as “nearly incontrovertible” while conceding that certain observables/thresholds are conventional and that historical records are fragmentary. The book’s stated standard (“avoid adding assumptions”) is not always easy to apply evenly in practice.

**Accessibility.** This book is for readers who enjoy technical, cross-disciplinary Bible study. It presumes comfort moving between Torah, prophets, gospels, and Second Temple/Greco-Roman sources. The writing is energetic and often explanatory, but it is not introductory.

**Notable strengths.** The method-first orientation (explicit “principles of evaluation,” repeated warnings about circularity and motivated reasoning) gives it a coherent evaluative frame. It surfaces the global “where does the day begin” problem early. It is system-building rather than purely critical. The supplemental material shows a real effort to stress-test chronology, and the writing often tells the reader exactly what would need independent verification.

**Limitations or concerns.** A cautious reader will want to independently verify many specific claims (eclipse visibility, manuscript-variant arguments, numerical/gematria claims, etc.). The book’s rhetoric can blur the line between critiquing tradition and dismissing alternative readings too quickly. There is scope creep: chapters sometimes absorb large side projects that may distract from the core calendar claims.

**Summary judgment.** On its own terms, “Time Tested Tradition” is an ambitious, internally organized attempt to rebuild a biblical calendar framework. Its strongest contribution is the way it forces the reader to confront hidden premises (especially global synchronization and “accessibility to all”) and to demand consistency across narratives and sources. Its main weakness is that the presentation sometimes overstates certainty and mixes rigorous argument with speculative or highly interpretive material. Readers deciding whether to invest time should expect a challenging, detailed, and decidedly non-mainstream thesis—worth engaging seriously if you are willing to verify sources and follow long chains of reasoning.

<summary><strong>Grok — Full detailed assessment</strong></summary>

"Time Tested Tradition" presents a comprehensive and meticulously researched examination of biblical calendar systems, chronology, and related teachings, arguing persuasively for a full-moon start to the lunar month and a lunar-based Sabbath cycle. The book's structure is logical and methodical, beginning with foundational principles for evaluating calendars and building progressively through specific topics like when the day and month begin, Sabbath observance, and key historical events. Each chapter demonstrates clear organization with numbered sections, biblical citations, and explicit conclusions, making the argument flow accessible despite its complexity. The fact-dependency approach—where later arguments build on earlier established principles—creates a coherent framework, though it requires readers to accept foundational premises about astronomical stability and scriptural primacy to fully appreciate the interconnected claims.

The use of evidence is one of the book's greatest strengths, combining Scripture, historical sources, astronomical calculations, and archaeological data in a way that invites verification. Biblical references are abundant and contextually rich, often including Hebrew word studies and cross-references. Historical sources like Josephus and Manetho are cited extensively, with clear explanations of their reliability and limitations. Astronomical evidence draws from modern software like Stellarium for retrocalculations, backed by historical celestial events that confirm the stability of celestial mechanics over millennia. Sources are presented transparently, with caveats about potential assumptions, allowing readers to check claims independently—a rare and commendable approach in religious scholarship.

Internal consistency holds up well across the 19 main chapters and 6 supplementary ones, though the arguments' interdependence creates some vulnerability; rejecting one foundational premise (such as the full-moon month start) could undermine multiple downstream conclusions. The book's treatment of potential objections is thorough. However, some astronomical and chronological arguments rely on specific assumptions about ancient observations and calendar alignments that may not be immediately verifiable without technical expertise.

Accessibility presents both opportunities and challenges. The book targets serious Bible students willing to engage deeply with Scripture, history, and astronomy. It assumes some familiarity with biblical narratives and basic astronomy, but provides sufficient explanation for motivated readers. Technical terms are defined, and the writing remains clear despite density. However, the sheer volume of detail and interconnected arguments may overwhelm casual readers.

Notable strengths include the book's courage in challenging long-held traditions, its comprehensive scope covering everything from Sabbath observance to Egyptian chronology, and its emphasis on testing claims against Scripture rather than consensus. The inclusion of extra chapters for specialized topics demonstrates thoroughness without overwhelming the main narrative. The author consistently prioritizes biblical authority while acknowledging the limitations of human understanding.

Limitations and concerns include the potential for confirmation bias in interpreting ambiguous passages to support the full-moon/lunar-Sabbath thesis, and the heavy reliance on astronomical retrocalculations that could be affected by uncertainties in ancient observational methods. Some arguments, particularly around Joshua's long day and specific date alignments, involve creative astronomical interpretations that may stretch plausibility for skeptics. The book's focus on disproving traditional views sometimes overshadows positive expositions of its alternative positions.

Overall quality and reliability of the presentation are high; this is a serious scholarly work that demonstrates intellectual rigor, extensive research, and honest engagement with counter-evidence. While not infallible (as the author acknowledges), it provides a compelling framework for understanding biblical timekeeping that deserves careful consideration by those interested in the intersection of Scripture, history, and astronomy.
