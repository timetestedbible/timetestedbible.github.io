# Independent AI Virtual Review: *Time Tested Tradition*

## Detailed Assessment

### Overview

*Time Tested Tradition* is an ambitious work of biblical hermeneutics and chronology that challenges nearly every conventional assumption about the biblical calendar, the timing of sacred observances, and the historical dating of key events from the Exodus to the Crucifixion. The author, Daniel Larimer, approaches these topics with a stated commitment to *Sola Scriptura*—deriving conclusions from Scripture alone while treating external traditions, including Jewish oral tradition and mainstream scholarly consensus, as potentially corrupted sources that must be tested against the biblical text.

The book advances several interconnected theses: that the biblical day begins at morning (first light) rather than sunset; that the biblical month begins at the full moon rather than the new/dark moon; that the year anchors to the Spring Equinox; that the weekly Sabbath is "lunar"—occurring on fixed days of the lunar month rather than on a continuous seven-day cycle; and that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus occurred in 32 AD. These conclusions, if accepted, would require fundamental revision of how both Jews and Christians have observed sacred times for millennia.

### Clarity of Argument

The author writes with considerable clarity and evident passion. Each chapter builds logically from stated premises, and the overall structure moves methodically from foundational principles through increasingly specific applications. The argumentative style is direct, often anticipating and addressing counterarguments. Key terms are defined, and the author takes care to distinguish between what Scripture explicitly states versus what has been assumed through tradition.

However, the rhetorical approach sometimes undermines clarity. The frequent use of terms like "inherited lies," "motivated reasoning," and accusations of intellectual dishonesty directed at traditional scholarship creates a combative tone that may distract from the substantive arguments. Readers who hold traditional views may find this framing alienating, while those already sympathetic may accept conclusions too readily without critical examination.

The treatment of logical fallacies in Chapter 2 is pedagogically useful, providing readers with tools to evaluate arguments. Yet the application of these fallacies throughout the book is not always even-handed—the author is quick to identify fallacious reasoning in opposing views but does not always apply the same scrutiny to supporting arguments.

### Use of Sources

The book engages with a substantial range of sources: the Hebrew and Greek biblical texts (with attention to original language nuances), Josephus, the Talmud, various ancient historians, astronomical data, and Chinese astronomical records. This breadth is commendable and demonstrates genuine research effort.

The treatment of sources, however, requires careful evaluation:

**Strengths:**
- The author shows awareness that translations can obscure original meanings and frequently appeals to Hebrew and Greek terminology.
- The astronomical arguments are presented with specific dates and calculable phenomena, making them in principle verifiable.
- The engagement with Josephus is detailed and attempts to reconcile apparent contradictions through careful chronological analysis.
- The use of multiple independent lines of evidence (Daniel's prophecy, Herod's chronology, astronomical data) to converge on 32 AD is methodologically sound in principle.

**Concerns:**
- The dismissal of the Talmud, Mishnah, and Jewish oral tradition as unreliable is presented as a methodological necessity, but this creates a hermeneutical framework where Scripture can only be interpreted through the author's lens, without the corrective of historical practice. Whether this is appropriate is a theological question readers must decide for themselves.
- Some etymological arguments (e.g., connecting "erev" primarily to "mixture" rather than "evening") may not reflect scholarly consensus on Hebrew semantics. Readers would benefit from consulting academic Hebrew lexicons.
- The astronomical calculations and historical datings presented are stated with confidence but require independent verification. The author acknowledges this for some claims but not consistently.

**Important caveat:** Many of the book's claims—particularly regarding astronomical events, ancient chronologies, and interpretations of Hebrew terms—require specialized expertise to evaluate fully. This reviewer cannot independently verify the accuracy of astronomical retrocalculations, the correctness of Hebrew etymological arguments, or the reliability of the author's reading of Josephus and other ancient sources. Readers interested in these claims should consult primary sources and subject-matter experts.

### Internal Consistency

The book demonstrates notable internal consistency. The author has constructed an integrated system where the morning day-start, full-moon month-start, equinox year-anchor, and lunar Sabbath all reinforce each other. The 32 AD resurrection date aligns with the proposed calendar mechanics, and the reinterpretation of Passion Week harmonizes with the "three days and three nights" prophecy under the author's framework.

This internal coherence is both a strength and a potential weakness. It is a strength because it shows systematic thinking and allows readers to test whether the pieces fit together. It is a potential weakness because highly coherent systems can become self-sealing—apparent counterevidence can always be reinterpreted to fit, and the very elegance of the system may create confirmation bias in both author and sympathetic readers.

The author does acknowledge some tensions (such as the ambiguity in identifying the equinox by unaided observation) and addresses apparent contradictions (such as reconciling different accounts in Josephus). This willingness to engage with difficulties rather than ignore them adds credibility.

### Structure and Organization

The book is well-organized. The progression from principles (Chapters 1-4) to specific calendar questions (Chapters 5-11) to historical chronology (Chapters 12-14) to alternative views and theology (Chapters 15-19) is logical. The supplementary "extra" chapters provide deeper dives into specific historical questions without interrupting the main flow.

Chapter lengths are manageable, and the use of section headings within chapters aids navigation. The author provides summaries and cross-references between related topics.

One structural note: the book assumes a reader willing to follow extended arguments and engage with technical details. This is appropriate for the subject matter but limits accessibility (discussed below).

### Accessibility

The writing is accessible to educated lay readers with interest in biblical studies. The author explains concepts when introducing them and provides context for unfamiliar terms. The logical structure helps readers follow complex chains of reasoning.

However, full engagement with the book requires:
- Familiarity with the biblical text (both Old and New Testaments)
- Willingness to consider detailed chronological and astronomical arguments
- Openness to questioning long-held assumptions
- Patience with technical discussions of Hebrew terms, calendar mechanics, and historical sources

Readers without background in biblical studies or ancient history may find some sections challenging. The book would benefit from a glossary and perhaps a visual timeline summarizing the proposed chronology.

### Strengths

1. **Systematic approach:** The author builds a complete, internally consistent alternative calendar system rather than offering piecemeal criticisms.

2. **Engagement with counterarguments:** The book anticipates objections and attempts to address them, showing awareness of opposing positions.

3. **Multiple lines of evidence:** The convergence of Daniel's prophecy, Herod's chronology, and astronomical data on 32 AD demonstrates an attempt at methodological rigor.

4. **Intellectual honesty about uncertainty:** The author acknowledges some areas of genuine ambiguity (e.g., equinox observation difficulty).

5. **Practical implications:** The book connects theological arguments to practical observance, helping readers understand what the conclusions would mean for daily life.

### Weaknesses

1. **Rhetorical combativeness:** The frequent accusations of "lies," dishonesty, and corruption in traditional scholarship may alienate readers and obscure the substantive arguments.

2. **Limited engagement with academic scholarship:** While the book engages with primary sources, there is less interaction with modern academic biblical scholarship, archaeology, and ancient Near Eastern studies that might complicate or challenge some claims.

3. **Potential overconfidence:** Some conclusions are stated with more certainty than the evidence may warrant. Claims about Hebrew etymology, astronomical events, and historical chronology often require expert verification.

4. **Selection effects:** The author selects evidence supporting the thesis while potentially underweighting contradictory evidence. This is a common challenge in revisionist scholarship.

5. **Theological assumptions:** The book's theological framework (regarding salvation, law, and grace) is presented as self-evidently biblical but represents particular interpretive choices that other sincere readers of Scripture have contested.

### Verdict

*Time Tested Tradition* is a serious, extensively argued work that challenges readers to examine assumptions about biblical timekeeping and chronology. Whether one ultimately accepts its conclusions, the book succeeds in demonstrating that many "obvious" features of traditional Jewish and Christian calendar practice are not explicitly mandated in Scripture and derive from post-biblical tradition.

The book will be most valuable to readers who:
- Are interested in alternative approaches to biblical interpretation
- Enjoy detailed textual and historical arguments
- Are willing to question traditional assumptions
- Can evaluate claims critically rather than accepting them on the author's authority

Readers should approach the book as an argument to be evaluated, not a settled conclusion to be accepted. The astronomical, chronological, and linguistic claims require independent verification. The theological conclusions flow from interpretive choices that readers must assess against their own understanding of Scripture.

## One-Paragraph Review

*Time Tested Tradition* presents a comprehensive, revisionist reconstruction of the biblical calendar, arguing that the day begins at morning, the month at the full moon, the year at the Spring Equinox, and the Sabbath follows a lunar rather than continuous weekly cycle—with the crucifixion dated to 32 AD. The author writes with clarity and passion, building an internally consistent system supported by extensive scriptural analysis, engagement with Josephus and other ancient sources, and astronomical arguments. The work is well-structured and demonstrates genuine research effort, though its combative rhetoric toward traditional scholarship may alienate some readers, and many of its historical and linguistic claims require expert verification that this review cannot provide. Readers seeking a thoughtful challenge to conventional assumptions about biblical timekeeping will find substantial material for reflection, while those committed to traditional Jewish or Christian calendar practice will encounter a vigorous, if sometimes one-sided, critique of their positions.
