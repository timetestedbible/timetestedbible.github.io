# Extra Chapter 6: Identifying the Pharaoh of the Exodus

## Introduction

Of all the Royal mummies preserved in Egypt's museums, which one was the Pharaoh of the Exodus? This question has been hotly debated for over a century, but when we simply follow the biblical text and corroborating evidence, the answer becomes remarkably clear: **Amenhotep II** (reigned c. 1450–1423 BC) was the Pharaoh who confronted Moses and experienced the ten plagues.

This chapter synthesizes the biblical, extra-biblical, and archaeological evidence that identifies Amenhotep II as the Exodus Pharaoh, while also explaining why the popular alternative—Ramesses II—fails to meet the biblical criteria.

## The Extra-Biblical Witness: Manetho

### Who Was Manetho?

Manetho was an Egyptian priest who served at Heliopolis in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. He wrote a comprehensive history of Egypt in Greek, drawing from ancient Egyptian sacred records. Although his original writings are lost, they survive through quotations in later historians—the earliest and most reliable being the 1st century AD Jewish historian Josephus.

Josephus wrote of Manetho:

> "I will set down his very words, as if I were to bring the very man himself into a court for a witness."
> — Josephus, Against Apion 1.1.14

### Manetho's Identification

Manetho described a people whose leader was called Moses, who were captives in Egypt, and who upon leaving "built a city in Judea and called it Jerusalem." Crucially, Manetho recorded that these people **took their journey from Egypt during the reign of Amenophis** (Greek form of "Amenhotep").

This is remarkable: Josephus didn't know the name "Amenhotep" independently—he only knew it because he was quoting Manetho, who had access to early Egyptian records. The name of the Exodus Pharaoh thus traces back through this chain:

1. **Ancient Egyptian records** → 
2. **Manetho (3rd century BC)** → 
3. **Josephus (1st century AD)** → 
4. **Us today**

The question then becomes: *Which* Amenhotep? The 18th Dynasty had several pharaohs named Amenhotep (I, II, III, and IV/Akhenaten). The biblical chronology resolves this question definitively.

## The Biblical Date: 1446 BC

### The Primary Text: 1 Kings 6:1

The most explicit chronological reference for the Exodus is found in 1 Kings 6:1:

> "In the **480th year** after the Israelites came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the temple of the LORD."

The fourth year of Solomon's reign is well-established as **966 BC** through multiple lines of evidence including Assyrian chronology and astronomical observations. Simple arithmetic gives us the Exodus date:

**966 BC + 480 years = 1446 BC**

### Confirmation: Judges 11:26

An independent confirmation appears in Judges 11:26, where Jephthah (c. 1100 BC) states:

> "For **300 years** Israel has occupied [the land east of the Jordan]."

Adding 300 years to c. 1100 BC gives approximately 1400 BC for the conquest, plus 40 years of wilderness wandering brings us back to c. 1440 BC for the Exodus—in perfect agreement with 1 Kings 6:1.

## Testing the Candidates

### Which Amenhotep Reigned in 1446 BC?

| Pharaoh | Reign Dates | Fit with 1446 BC |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Amenhotep I | c. 1546–1526 BC | Too early |
| **Amenhotep II** | **c. 1450–1423 BC** | **1446 BC falls within his reign** |
| Amenhotep III | c. 1414–1377 BC | Too late |

The biblical date of 1446 BC falls squarely within the reign of **Amenhotep II**. This must be the Amenhotep that Manetho was referring to.

---

## Additional Biblical Criteria

The Bible provides several other details about the Exodus Pharaoh and his predecessor that can be tested against the Egyptian record.

### Test 1: The Predecessor's Reign of 40+ Years

In Exodus 2:23, we read:

> "During that long period, the king of Egypt died."

Acts 7:30 specifies this "long period" as 40 years:

> "After **40 years had passed**, an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai."

This means the Pharaoh of the oppression (the one Moses fled from) must have reigned for **more than 40 years**.

**Result for Amenhotep II**: His predecessor was his father **Thutmose III**, who reigned for **54 years**—the longest reign of any 18th Dynasty pharaoh. ✓

**Result for Ramesses II**: His predecessor **Seti I** reigned only **11 years** (1290–1279 BC). ✗

### Test 2: The Firstborn Son Did Not Inherit

Exodus 11:5 describes the tenth plague:

> "Every firstborn son in Egypt will die, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sits on the throne..."

The Exodus Pharaoh's firstborn son should have died in the plague and therefore could not have inherited the throne.

**Result for Amenhotep II**: His successor was **Thutmose IV**, who was **not his firstborn son**. Egyptian records reveal that Thutmose IV had an older brother—the Crown Prince—who mysteriously died and "disappeared from history." ✓

**Result for Ramesses II**: If Ramesses II were the Pharaoh of oppression, his successor Merneptah's firstborn son **Seti II** *did* inherit the throne. ✗

### The Dream Stele Evidence

Between the paws of the Great Sphinx at Giza stands the "Dream Stele," commissioned by Pharaoh Thutmose IV. It tells how he fell asleep in the shade of the Sphinx and the gods appeared to him in a dream, promising he would become the next Pharaoh.

This was royal propaganda. Thutmose IV needed divine legitimacy precisely because he wasn't expected to become Pharaoh—his older brother was the Crown Prince. The fact that he felt compelled to explain his succession with a divine dream indicates that his older brother's death was unexpected and perhaps suspicious.

This fits perfectly with the biblical account: Amenhotep II's firstborn son died in the tenth plague, leaving the younger Thutmose IV to inherit the throne through extraordinary circumstances.

## Archaeological Evidence: The Abandonment of Avaris

Avaris (modern Tell el-Dab'a) was a major site in the Egyptian Delta. Austrian archaeologist Manfred Bietak excavated an 18th Dynasty palace there and made a striking discovery:

> The archaeological record demonstrates that the occupation of this palace covers the time from Ahmose to Amenhotep II. This palace complex was occupied through the reigns of Thutmose III and Amenhotep II, **when it was suddenly and mysteriously abandoned**.

The 18th Dynasty palace at Avaris—the very region associated with the Israelite presence in Egypt—was inexplicably abandoned during the reign of Amenhotep II. This archaeological evidence aligns remarkably well with an Exodus occurring during his reign.

## The Case Against Ramesses II

### The Chronological Problem

Ramesses II began his reign in **1279 BC**—a full **167 years** after the biblical date of 1446 BC. This alone disqualifies him as the Exodus Pharaoh.

### The "Rameses" City Name (Exodus 1:11)

The main argument for Ramesses II comes from Exodus 1:11, which mentions that the Israelites built a store city named "Rameses." However, this is easily explained as **scribal updating**—a common biblical practice where later, more familiar place names replace earlier ones.

A clear example is found in Genesis 14:14, which says Abram pursued his enemies "as far as **Dan**." But the city wasn't called Dan until centuries later (Judges 18:29 explicitly states it "had formerly been called Laish"). The later name "Dan" was substituted because readers would recognize it.

Just as we wouldn't date Abraham based on the name "Dan," we shouldn't date the Exodus based on the name "Rameses." The city may have been called something else in the 15th century BC, with "Rameses" being the name familiar to later readers.

### Summary: Ramesses II Fails Every Test

| Test | Ramesses II | Result |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Biblical date (1446 BC) | Reign began 1279 BC | ✗ 167 years too late |
| Predecessor reigned 40+ years | Seti I reigned 11 years | ✗ |
| Firstborn did not inherit | If oppression pharaoh, Seti II (firstborn) did inherit | ✗ |
| Named by Manetho | Manetho names Amenhotep, not Ramesses | ✗ |

## How We Date Egyptian Kings

The user may wonder how Egyptologists arrived at dates like "1450–1423 BC" for Amenhotep II. Egyptian chronology is established through several methods:

### 1. King Lists and Reign Lengths

Egyptian sources like the Turin Royal Canon and temple walls record sequences of kings and their reign lengths. By adding these lengths and anchoring them to fixed points, a chronological framework emerges.

### 2. Astronomical Observations

Ancient Egyptians recorded observations of celestial events, particularly the heliacal rising of Sirius (called "Sothis"), which they used to regulate their calendar. When these observations can be dated astronomically, they provide fixed anchor points.

### 3. Synchronisms with Other Cultures

Egyptian records sometimes mention foreign rulers (Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites) whose dates are known from other sources. These synchronisms help cross-check the Egyptian timeline.

### 4. Radiocarbon Dating

Modern radiocarbon dating of organic materials from Egyptian contexts provides independent verification, though with wider error margins than the historical methods.

### 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Chronology

The following table presents the 18th Dynasty pharaohs relevant to the Exodus, with their reign periods and durations:

| Pharaoh | Reign Dates (BC) | Duration | Role in Exodus Narrative |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Ahmose I | c. 1550–1525 | 25 years | Dynasty founder, expelled Hyksos |
| Amenhotep I | c. 1525–1504 | 21 years | — |
| Thutmose I | c. 1504–1492 | 12 years | — |
| Thutmose II | c. 1492–1479 | 13 years | — |
| Hatshepsut | c. 1479–1458 | 21 years | Female pharaoh, coregent |
| **Thutmose III** | **c. 1479–1425** | **54 years** | **Pharaoh of the Oppression** (Moses fled from him) |
| **Amenhotep II** | **c. 1450–1423** | **27 years** | **Pharaoh of the Exodus** (1446 BC within his reign) |
| **Thutmose IV** | **c. 1423–1413** | **10 years** | **Not the firstborn** (Dream Stele legitimacy) |
| Amenhotep III | c. 1413–1375 | 38 years | — |
| Amenhotep IV (Akhenaten) | c. 1375–1358 | 17 years | The "heretic" pharaoh |

*Note: Amenhotep II's reign overlapped with Thutmose III during a coregency period (c. 1450–1425 BC).*

### 19th Dynasty Pharaoh Chronology (Late Date Candidates)

| Pharaoh | Reign Dates (BC) | Duration | Why Not the Exodus Pharaoh |
|---------|------------------|----------|----------------------------|
| Ramesses I | c. 1295–1294 | 2 years | Dynasty founder |
| **Seti I** | c. 1294–1279 | **11 years** | **Fails 40+ year test** (Acts 7:30) |
| **Ramesses II** | c. 1279–1213 | 66 years | **167 years too late** for 1446 BC |
| Merneptah | c. 1213–1203 | 10 years | His firstborn (Seti II) did inherit |

The 18th Dynasty chronology is among the best-established portions of Egyptian history, with multiple independent lines of evidence converging on similar dates. The dates given here follow the conventional "low chronology" used by most Egyptologists, though some scholars propose slightly earlier dates.

## The Late Date Theory: Reinterpreting Scripture

Proponents of Ramesses II as the Exodus Pharaoh (the "late date" of c. 1260–1250 BC) must reinterpret 1 Kings 6:1. Their argument:

> The 480 years isn't literal—it represents 12 generations of 40 years each. But 40 years per generation is too long; it should be 25 years. So 12 × 25 = 300 years, which when added to 966 BC gives c. 1266 BC, fitting Ramesses II's reign.

This interpretation is problematic for several reasons:

1. **It's agenda-driven**: Before the late date theory existed, no one read "480 years" and thought "that really means 300 years."

2. **It contradicts Judges 11:26**: Jephthah's 300 years of occupation independently confirms the 15th century date.

3. **It requires dismissing multiple witnesses**: Late date advocates must also argue that Stephen's testimony in Acts 7 (40 years in Midian) is "unreliable," that Manetho is "unreliable," and that Jephthah's numbers are "unreliable."

4. **It ignores the evidence that fits**: While selectively dismissing inconvenient texts, it relies entirely on a city name that can be explained by standard scribal updating.

## Conclusion: The Evidence Is Clear

When the biblical, extra-biblical, and archaeological evidence is weighed together, the identification of **Amenhotep II** as the Pharaoh of the Exodus is remarkably strong:

| Evidence | Amenhotep II | Ramesses II |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Biblical date (1446 BC) | ✓ Falls within reign | ✗ 167 years too late |
| Manetho's identification | ✓ Names "Amenhotep" | ✗ Not named |
| Predecessor reigned 40+ years | ✓ Thutmose III: 54 years | ✗ Seti I: 11 years |
| Firstborn did not inherit | ✓ Thutmose IV was younger son | ✗ Seti II was firstborn |
| Unexpected succession | ✓ Dream Stele evidence | N/A |
| Archaeological evidence | ✓ Avaris abandoned | ✗ Pi-Ramesses built later |

The mummy of Amenhotep II resides in the Egyptian Museum. According to the converging lines of evidence, when you look at this mummy, you are looking at the very man who dealt with Moses, who hardened his heart and refused to let God's people go, who witnessed the ten plagues, and from whom God delivered Israel with a mighty hand.

## Summary of Key Points

1. **Manetho** (3rd century BC), quoted by Josephus, names "Amenhotep" as the Pharaoh during the Exodus.

2. **1 Kings 6:1** dates the Exodus to 480 years before Solomon's 4th year (966 BC), yielding **1446 BC**.

3. **Judges 11:26** independently confirms a 15th century BC Exodus.

4. **Amenhotep II** (c. 1450–1423 BC) is the only "Amenhotep" whose reign encompasses 1446 BC.

5. **Thutmose III**, Amenhotep II's predecessor, reigned 54 years—matching the 40+ year requirement from Acts 7.

6. **Thutmose IV**, Amenhotep II's successor, was not his firstborn—matching the tenth plague's effect.

7. The **Dream Stele** shows Thutmose IV needed divine legitimacy because his older brother's death was unexpected.

8. The **18th Dynasty palace at Avaris** was mysteriously abandoned during Amenhotep II's reign.

9. **Ramesses II** fails every biblical criterion and is 167 years too late for the 1446 BC date.

10. The "Rameses" city name in Exodus 1:11 is likely **scribal updating**, just as "Dan" in Genesis 14:14.
