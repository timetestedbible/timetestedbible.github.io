  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>The city is filled with shouting <span class='add'>men</span>: thy slain are not slain with swords, nor are thy dead those who have died in battle.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>All thy princes have fled, and <span class='add'>thy</span> captives are tightly bound, and the mighty <span class='add'>men</span> in thee have fled far away.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>it is</span> a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and <span class='add'>there is</span> perplexity <span class='add'>sent</span> from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the Valley of Zion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Elamites took <span class='add'>their</span> quivers, and <span class='add'>there were</span> men mounted on horses, and <span class='add'>there was</span> a gathering for battle.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it shall be <span class='add'>that</span> thy choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up thy gates.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they shall uncover the gates of Judah, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one <span class='add'>had</span> turned the water of the old pool into the city;   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and that they <span class='add'>had</span> pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And ye procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but ye looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with sackcloth:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until ye die.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Shebna the treasurer, and say to him, Why art thou here?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and what hast thou to do here, that thou hast here hewn thyself a sepulcher, and madest thyself a sepulcher on high, and hast graven for thyself a dwelling in the rock?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy <span class='add'>such</span> a man, and will take away thy robe and thy glorious crown,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and will cast thee into a great and unmeasured land, and there thou shalt die: and he will bring thy fair chariot to shame, and the house of thy prince to be trodden down.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt be removed from thy stewardship, and from thy place.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and I will put on him thy robe, and I will grant him thy crown with power, and I will give thy stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key of the house of David <span class='add'>upon</span> his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
