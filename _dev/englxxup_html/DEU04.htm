for every man that went after Baal-peor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him from among you.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But ye that kept close to the Lord your God are all alive today.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Behold, I have shown you ordinances and judgments as the Lord commanded me, that ye should do so in the land into which ye go to inherit it.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And ye shall keep and do them: for this is your wisdom and understanding before all nations, as many as shall hear all these ordinances; and they shall say, Behold, this great nation <span class='add'>is</span> a wise and understanding people.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For what manner of nation <span class='add'>is so</span> great, which has God so near to them as the Lord our God <span class='add'>is</span> in all things in whatsoever we may call upon him?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And what manner of nation <span class='add'>is so</span> great, which has righteous ordinances and judgments according to all this law, which I set before you this day?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself, and keep thy heart diligently: forget not any of the things, which thine eyes have seen, and let them not depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt teach thy sons and thy sons’ sons,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><span class='add'>even the things that happened in</span> the day in which ye stood before the Lord our God in Horeb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And ye drew nigh and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven: <span class='add'>there was</span> darkness, blackness, <span class='add'>and</span> tempest.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire a voice of words, which ye heard: and ye saw no likeness, only <span class='add'>ye heard</span> a voice.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he announced to you his covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you ordinances and judgments, that ye should do them on the land, into which ye go to inherit it.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And take good heed to your hearts, for ye saw no similitude in the day in which the Lord spoke to you in Horeb in the mountain out of the midst of the fire:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>lest ye transgress, and make to yourselves a carved image, any kind of figure, the likeness of male or female,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>the likeness of any beast of those that are on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird which flies under heaven,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>the likeness of any reptile which creeps on the earth, the likeness of any fish of those which are in the waters under the earth;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and lest having looked up to the sky, and having seen the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the heavenly bodies, thou shouldest go astray and worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God has distributed to all the nations under heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But God took you, and led you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord God was angry with me for the things said by you, and swore that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I should not enter into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I am to die in this land, and shall not pass over this Jordan; but ye are to pass over, and shall inherit this good land.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made with you, and ye transgress, and make to yourselves a graven image of any of the things concerning which the Lord thy God commanded thee.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when thou shalt have begotten sons, and shalt have sons’ sons, and ye shall have dwelt a long time on the land, and shall have transgressed, and made a graven image of anything, and shall have done wickedly before the Lord your God to provoke him;   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you, that ye shall surely perish from off the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it there; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly cut off.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord shall scatter you among all nations, and ye shall be left few in number among all the nations, among which the Lord shall bring you.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And ye shall there serve other gods, the works of the hands of men, wood and stones, which cannot see, nor can they hear, nor eat, nor smell.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And there ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye shall find him whenever ye shall seek him with all your heart, and with all your soul in your affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And all these things shall come upon thee in the last days, and thou shalt turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Because the Lord thy God <span class='add'>is</span> a God of pity: he will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which the Lord swore to them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Ask of the former days which were before thee, from the day when God created man upon the earth, and <span class='add'>beginning</span> at the <span class='add'>one</span> end of heaven to the other end of heaven, if there has happened anything like to this great event, if such a thing has been heard:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>if a nation have heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and hast lived;   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>if God has assayed to go and take to himself a nation out of the midst of <span class='add'>another</span> nation with trial, and with signs, and with wonders, and with war, and with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights, according to all the things which the Lord our God did in Egypt in thy sight.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So that thou shouldest know that the Lord thy God he is God, and there is none beside him.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>His voice was made audible from heaven to instruct thee, and he showed thee upon the earth his great fire, and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Because he loved thy fathers, he also chose you their seed after them, and he brought thee himself with his great strength out of Egypt,   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>to destroy nations great and stronger than thou before thy face, to bring thee in, to give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And thou shalt know this day, and shalt consider in thy heart, that the Lord thy God he <span class='add'>is</span> God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath, and there is none else but he.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And keep ye his commandments, and his ordinances, all that I command you this day;
