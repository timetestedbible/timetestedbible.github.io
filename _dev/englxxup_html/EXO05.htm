I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they say to him, The God of the Hebrews has called us to him: we will go therefore a three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God, lest at any time death or slaughter happen to us.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, turn the people from their works? depart each of you to your works.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said, Behold now, the people is very numerous; let us not then give them rest from their work.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Pharaoh gave orders to the taskmasters of the people and the accountants, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ye shall no longer give straw to the people for brickmaking as yesterday and the third day; but let them go themselves, and collect straw for themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou shalt impose on them daily the rate of brickmaking which they perform: thou shalt not abate anything, for they are idle; therefore have they cried, saying, Let us arise and do sacrifice to our God.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let the works of these men be made grievous, and let them care for these things, and not care for vain words.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the taskmasters and the accountants hastened them, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I <span class='add'>will</span> give you straw no longer.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go ye, yourselves, get for yourselves straw whencesoever ye can find it, for nothing is diminished from your rate.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So the people were dispersed in all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble for straw.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the taskmasters hastened them, saying, Fulfill your regular daily tasks, even as when straw was given you.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the accountants of the race of the children of Israel, who were set over them by the masters of Pharaoh, were scourged, <span class='add'>and questioned</span>, <span class='add'>men</span> saying, Why have ye not fulfilled your rates of brickwork as yesterday and the third day, today also?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the accountants of the children of Israel went in and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou act thus to thy servants?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Straw is not given to thy servants, and they tell us to make brick; and behold thy servants have been scourged: thou wilt therefore injure thy people.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to them, Ye are idle, ye are idlers: therefore ye say, Let us go <span class='add'>and</span> do sacrifice to our God.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now then go and work, for straw shall not be given to you, yet ye shall return the rate of bricks.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the accountants of the children of Israel saw themselves in an evil plight, <span class='add'>men</span> saying, Ye shall not fail to deliver the daily rate of the brickmaking.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they met Moses and Aaron coming forth to meet them, as they came forth from Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they said to them, The Lord look upon you and judge you, for ye have made our savor abominable before Pharaoh, and before his servants, to put a sword into his hands to slay us.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses turned to the Lord, and said, I pray, Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? and wherefore hast thou sent me?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For from the time that I went to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has afflicted this people, and thou hast not delivered thy people.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
