And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amasa out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw everyone that came to him standing still.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they came and besieged him in Abel and Beth-maacah: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray ye, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he drew nigh to her, and the woman said to him, Art thou Joab? and he said, I <span class='add'>am</span>. And she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she spoke, saying, Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>I am a peaceable one of the strong ones in Israel; but thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother-city in Israel: why dost thou seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Is not the case thus, that a man of Mount Ephraim, Sheba son of Bichri by name, has even lifted up his hand against King David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and they took off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Joab <span class='add'>was</span> over all the forces of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <span class='add'>was</span> over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Adoram <span class='add'>was</span> over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud <span class='add'>was</span> recorder.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Sheva <span class='add'>was</span> scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar <span class='add'>were</span> priests.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Moreover Ira the <span class='add'>son of</span> Jair was priest to David.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
