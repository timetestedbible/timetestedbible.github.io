And the Lord said to me, Call his name, Spoil quickly, plunder speedily.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For before the child shall know <span class='add'>how</span> to call <span class='add'>his</span> father or <span class='add'>his</span> mother, <span class='add'>one</span> shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to me yet again, <span class='add'>saying</span>,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Because this people chooses not the water of Siloam that goes softly, but wills to have Rezin, and the son of Remaliah <span class='add'>to be</span> king over you;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon you the water of the river, strong and abundant, <span class='add'>even</span> the king of the Assyrians, and his glory: and he shall come up over every valley of yours, and shall walk over every wall of yours:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and he shall take away from Judah <span class='add'>every</span> man who shall be able to lift up his head, <span class='add'>and every one</span> able to accomplish anything; and his camp shall fill the breadth of thy land, <span class='add'>O</span> God with us.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Know, ye Gentiles, and be conquered; hearken ye, even to the extremity of the earth: be conquered, after ye have strengthened yourselves; for even if ye should again strengthen yourselves, ye shall again be conquered.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall bring it to nought; and whatsoever word ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you: for God is with us.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, With a strong hand they revolt from the course of the way of this people, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let them not say, <span class='add'>It is</span> hard, for whatsoever this people says, is hard: but fear not ye their fear, neither be dismayed.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sanctify ye the Lord himself; and he shall be thy fear.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if thou shalt trust in him, he shall be to thee for a sanctuary; and ye shall not come against <span class='add'>him</span> as against a stumbling stone, neither as against the falling of a rock: but the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and the dwellers in Jerusalem in a pit.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Therefore many among them shall be weak, and fall, and be crushed; and they shall draw nigh, and men shall be taken securely.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Then shall those who seal themselves that they may not learn the law be made manifest.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>one</span> shall say, I will wait for God, who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob, and I will trust in him.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Behold I and the children which God has given me: and they shall be <span class='add'>for</span> signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells in Mount Zion.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And if they should say to you, Seek those who have in them a divining spirit, and them that speak out of the earth, them that speak vain words, who speak out of their belly: shall not a nation diligently seek to their God? why do they seek to the dead concerning the living?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For he has given the law for a help, that they should not speak according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give for it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And famine shall come sorely upon you, and it shall come to pass, <span class='add'>that</span> when ye shall be hungry, ye shall be grieved, and ye shall speak ill of the prince and your fathers’ ordinances: and they shall look up to heaven above,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and they shall look on the earth below, and behold severe distress, and darkness, affliction, and anguish, and darkness so that <span class='add'>one cannot</span> see; and he that is in anguish shall not be distressed only for a time.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Drink this first.
