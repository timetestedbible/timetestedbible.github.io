And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came in to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give charge to thy household; <span class='add'>for</span> thou shalt die, and not live.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Hezekiah turned to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Lord, remember, I pray thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thine eyes. And Hezekiah wept with a great weeping.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Isaiah was in the middle court, and the word of the Lord came to him, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Turn back, and thou shalt say to Hezekiah the ruler of my people, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up to the house of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will add to thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will defend this city for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it upon the ulcer, and he shall be well.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, What <span class='add'>is</span> the sign that the Lord will heal me, and I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Isaiah said, This <span class='add'>is</span> the sign from the Lord, that the Lord will perform the word which he has spoken, the shadow <span class='add'>of the dial</span> shall advance ten degrees: <span class='add'>or</span> if it should go back ten degrees <span class='add'>this would also be the sign</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Hezekiah said, <span class='add'>It is</span> a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return ten degrees backward on the dial.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Isaiah the prophet cried to the Lord: and the shadow returned back ten degrees on the dial.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>At that time Merodach-baladan, son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah, because he had heard that Hezekiah was sick.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Hezekiah rejoiced at them, and showed all the house of his spices, the silver and the gold, the spices, and the fine oil, and the armory, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing which Hezekiah did not show them in his house, and in all his dominion.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Isaiah the prophet went in to King Hezekiah, and said to him, What said these men? and whence came they to thee?
