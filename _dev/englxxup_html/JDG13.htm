  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Of all things concerning which I spoke to the woman, she shall beware.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>She shall eat of nothing that comes of the vine yielding wine, and let her not drink wine or strong liquor, and let her not eat anything unclean: all things that I have charged her she shall observe.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, Let us detain thee here, and prepare before thee a kid of the goats.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, If thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wouldest offer a whole burnt offering, to the Lord thou shalt offer it: for Manoah knew not that he <span class='add'>was</span> an angel of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, What <span class='add'>is</span> thy name, that <span class='add'>when</span> thy word shall come to pass, we may glorify thee?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why dost thou thus ask after my name; whereas it is wonderful?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Manoah took a kid of the goats and its meat offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord; and <span class='add'>the angel</span> wrought a distinct work, and Manoah and his wife were looking on.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the flame went up above the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord went up in the flame; and Manoah and his wife were looking, and they fell upon their face to the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the angel appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife: then Manoah knew that this <span class='add'>was</span> an angel of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But his wife said to him, If the Lord were pleased to slay us, he would not have received of our hand a whole burnt offering and a meat offering; and he would not have shown us all these things, neither would he have caused us to hear all these things as at this time.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the woman brought forth a son, and she called his name Samson; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord began to go out with him in the camp of Dan, and between Zorah and Eshtaol.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
