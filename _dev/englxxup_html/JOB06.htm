will the wild ass bray for nothing, if he is not seeking food?  </div><div class='q'>Or again, will the ox low at the manger, when he has fodder?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Shall bread be eaten without salt?  </div><div class='q'>Or again, is there taste in empty words?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For my wrath cannot cease;  </div><div class='q'>For I perceive my food as the smell of a lion <span class='add'>to be</span> loathsome.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For oh that he would grant <span class='add'>my desire</span>, and my petition might come,  </div><div class='q'>And the Lord would grant my hope!   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let the Lord begin and wound me,  </div><div class='q'>But let him not utterly destroy me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped: I will not shrink from it;  </div><div class='q'>For I have not denied the holy words of my God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For what is my strength, that I continue?  </div><div class='q'>What is my time, that my soul endures?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Is my strength the strength of stones?  </div><div class='q'>Or is my flesh of brass?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Or have I not trusted in him?  </div><div class='q'>But help is <span class='add'>far</span> from me.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Mercy has rejected me;  </div><div class='q'>And the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>My nearest relations have not regarded me;  </div><div class='q'>They have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They who used to reverence me, now have come against me  </div><div class='q'>Like snow or congealed ice.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is not known what it was.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thus I also have been deserted of all;  </div><div class='q'>And I am ruined, and become an outcast.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Behold the ways of the Temanites,  </div><div class='q'>Ye that mark the paths of the Sabeans.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>They too that trust in cities and riches  </div><div class='q'>Shall come to shame.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But ye also have come to me without pity;  </div><div class='q'>So that beholding my wound ye are afraid.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>What? have I made any demand of you?  </div><div class='q'>Or do I ask for strength from you,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>To deliver me from enemies,  </div><div class='q'>Or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones?   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Teach ye me, and I will be silent:  </div><div class='q'>If in anything I have erred, tell me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain,  </div><div class='q'>Because I do not ask strength of you.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Neither will your reproof cause me to cease my words,  </div><div class='q'>For neither will I endure the sound of your speech.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Even because ye attack the fatherless,  </div><div class='q'>And insult your friend.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Sit down now, and let there not be unrighteousness;  </div><div class='q'>And unite again with the just.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For there is no injustice in my tongue;  </div><div class='q'>And does not my throat meditate understanding?
