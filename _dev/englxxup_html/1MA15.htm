<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 15</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent letters from the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince of the Jews, and to all the people;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>the contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon the high priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Jews, greeting:   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>my meaning also being to go through the country, that I may be avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdom desolate:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides they granted.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country with thine own stamp.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them be free; and all the armor that thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thy hands, let them remain unto thee.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it be forgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we will honor thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honor, so that your honor shall be known throughout the world.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochus into the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces came together unto him, so that few were left with Trypho.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore being pursued by King Antiochus, he fled unto Dor, which lieth by the sea side:   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>for he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then camped Antiochus against Dor, having with him a hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And when he had compassed the city round about, and joined ships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city by land and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome, having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were written these things:   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Lucius, consul of the Romans unto King Ptolemy, greeting:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Jews’ ambassadors, our friends and confederates, came unto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemies against them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fled from their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the high priest, that he may punish them according to their own law.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and to all the countries, and to Sampsames, and the Lacedaemonians, and to Delos, and Myndos, and Sicyon, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodes, and Phaselis, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Antiochus the king camped against Dor the second <span class='add'>day</span>, assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means he shut up Trypho, that he could neither go out nor in.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aid him; silver also, and gold, and much armor.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Nevertheless he would not receive them, but broke all the covenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange unto him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends, to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazara, with the tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and the tributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion without the borders of Judea:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; and for the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities, other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fight against you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Athenobius the king’s friend came to Jerusalem: and when he saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silver plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told him the king’s message.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither taken other men’s land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certain time.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of our fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazara, albeit they did great harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give a hundred talents for them.  </div><div class='p'>Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word;   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>but returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto him of these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>In the mean time fled Trypho by ship unto Orthosia.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him a host of footmen and horsemen,   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and commanded him to remove his host toward Judea: also he commanded him to build up Kedron, and to fortify the gates, and to war against the people; but as for the king <span class='add'>himself</span>, he pursued Trypho.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when he had built up Kedron, he set horsemen there, and a host <span class='add'>of footmen</span>, to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
