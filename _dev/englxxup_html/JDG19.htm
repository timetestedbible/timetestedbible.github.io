  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to him, We are passing by from Bethlehem Judah to the sides of Mount Ephraim: I am from thence, and I went as far as Bethlehem Judah, and I am going home, and there is no man to take me into his house.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet is there straw and food for our asses, and bread and wine for me and my handmaid and the young man with thy servants; there is no want of anything.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the old man said, Peace <span class='add'>be</span> to thee; only be every want of thine upon me, only do thou by no means lodge in the street.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brought him into his house, and made room for his asses; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they <span class='add'>were</span> comforting their heart, when, behold, the men of the city, sons of transgressors, compassed the house, knocking at the door: and they spoke to the old man the owner of the house, saying, Bring out the man who came into thy house, that we may know him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the master of the house came out to them, and said, Nay, brethren, do not ye wrong, I pray you, after this man has come into my house; do not ye this folly.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Behold my daughter a virgin, and the man’s concubine: I will bring them out, and humble ye them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes; but to this man do not this folly.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But the men would not consent to hearken to him; so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night till the morning, and let her go when the morning dawned.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the woman came toward morning, and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was, until it was light.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And her husband rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went forth to go on his journey; and, behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down by the doors of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said to her, Rise, and let us go; and she answered not, for she was dead: and he took her upon his ass, and went to his place.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he took his sword, and laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve parts, and sent them to every coast of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it was so, that everyone who saw it said, <span class='add'>Such a day</span> as this has not happened nor has been seen from the day of the going up of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this day: take ye counsel concerning it, and speak.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
