I have commanded you.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Bethel and Ai, westward of Ai.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the ambuscade <span class='add'>was</span> on the west side of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the king of Ai saw <span class='add'>it</span>, he hastened and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people <span class='add'>that were</span> with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade <span class='add'>formed</span> against him behind the city.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>There was no one left in Ai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand with the spear that is in thy hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into thy hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joshua stretched out his hand <span class='add'>and</span> his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hastened and burned the city with fire.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And when the inhabitants of Ai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and smote the men of Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some <span class='add'>being</span> on this side, and some on that; and they smote them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they took the king of Ai alive, and brought him to Joshua.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Ai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them <span class='add'>even</span> to the end, then Joshua returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: <span class='add'>they slew</span> all the inhabitants of Ai.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua burned the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap forever, <span class='add'>even</span> to this day.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he hanged the king of Ai on a gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
