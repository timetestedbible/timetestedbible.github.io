and your city shall be in the midst of this, and the suburbs of the cities <span class='add'>as described</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And ye shall give the cities to the Levites, the six cities of refuge which ye shall give for the slayer to flee thither, and in addition to these, forty-two cities.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Ye shall give to the Levites in all forty-eight cities, them and their suburbs.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And as for the cities which ye shall give out of the possession of the children of Israel, from those <span class='add'>that have</span> much <span class='add'>ye shall give</span> much, and from those that have less ye shall give less: they shall give of their cities to the Levites each one according to his inheritance which they shall inherit.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye are to cross over Jordan into the land of Canaan.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And ye shall appoint to yourselves cities: they shall be to you cities of refuge for the slayer to flee to, everyone who has killed another unintentionally.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the cities shall be to you places of refuge from the avenger of blood, and the slayer shall not die until he stands before the congregation for judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the cities which ye shall assign, <span class='add'>even</span> the six cities, shall be places of refuge for you.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ye shall assign three cities on the other side of Jordan, and ye shall assign three cities in the land of Canaan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>It shall be a place of refuge for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for him that sojourns among you;

let the murderer by all means be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if he should smite him with an instrument of wood from his hand, whereby he may die, and he <span class='add'>thus</span> die, he is a murderer; let the murderer by all means be put to death.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: whensoever he shall meet him he shall slay him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if he should thrust him through enmity, or cast anything upon him from an ambuscade, and the man should die,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>or if he have smitten him with his hand through anger, and the man should die, let the man that smote him be put to death by all means, he is a murderer: let the murderer by all means be put to death: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meets him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But if he should thrust him suddenly, not through enmity, or cast anything upon him, not from an ambuscade,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>or <span class='add'>smite him</span> with any stone, whereby a man may die, unawares, and it should fall upon him, and he should die, but he was not his enemy, nor sought to hurt him;
