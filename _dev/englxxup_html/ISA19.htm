  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Where are now thy wise men? and let them declare to thee, and say, What has the Lord of hosts purposed upon Egypt?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The princes of Tanis have failed, and the princes of Memphis are lifted up <span class='add'>with pride</span>, and they shall cause Egypt to wander by tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the Lord has prepared for them a spirit of error, and they have caused Egypt to err in all their works, as one staggers who is drunken and vomits also.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there shall be no work to the Egyptians, which shall make head or tail, or beginning or end.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But in that day the Egyptians shall be as women, in fear and in trembling because of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall bring upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the land of the Jews shall be for a terror to the Egyptians: whosoever shall name it to them, they shall fear, because of the counsel which the Lord of hosts has purposed concerning it.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the city of Asedec.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of the Egyptians, and a pillar to the Lord by its border.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it shall be for a sign to the Lord forever in the land of Egypt: for they shall presently cry to the Lord by reason of them that afflict them, and he shall send them a man who shall save them; he shall judge and save them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; and they shall offer sacrifices, and shall vow vows to the Lord, and pay <span class='add'>them</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a stroke, and shall completely heal them: and they shall return to the Lord, and he shall hear them, and thoroughly heal them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>In that day shall Israel be third with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of hosts has blessed,   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>saying, Blessed be my people that is in Egypt, and that is among the Assyrians, and Israel mine inheritance.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
