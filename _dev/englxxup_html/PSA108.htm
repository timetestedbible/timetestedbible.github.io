<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 108</div><div class='d'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For the end, a Psalm of David. </div> <div class='q'>O God, pass not over my praise in silence;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty <span class='add'>man</span> have been opened against me:  </div><div class='q'>They have spoken against me with a crafty tongue.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they have compassed me with words of hatred;  </div><div class='q'>And fought against me without a cause.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me:  </div><div class='q'>But I continued to pray.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they rewarded me evil for good,  </div><div class='q'>And hatred for my love.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Set thou a sinner against him;  </div><div class='q'>And let the devil stand at his right hand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When he is judged, let him go forth condemned:  </div><div class='q'>And let his prayer become sin.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let his days be few:  </div><div class='q'>And let another take his office of overseer.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let his children be orphans,  </div><div class='q'>And his wife a widow.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Let his children wander without a dwelling place, and beg:  </div><div class='q'>Let them be cast out of their habitations.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Let <span class='add'>his</span> creditor exact all that belongs to him:  </div><div class='q'>And let strangers spoil his labors.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Let him have no helper;  </div><div class='q'>Neither let there be anyone to have compassion on his fatherless children.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Let his children be <span class='add'>given up</span> to utter destruction:  </div><div class='q'>In one generation let his name be blotted out.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord;  </div><div class='q'>And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let them be before the Lord continually;  </div><div class='q'>And let their memorial be blotted out from the earth.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Because he remembered not to show mercy,  </div><div class='q'>But persecuted the needy and poor man,  </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>that</span> to slay him that was pricked in the heart.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him;  </div><div class='q'>And he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yea, he put on cursing as a garment,  </div><div class='q'>And it is come as water into his bowels,  </div><div class='q'>And as oil into his bones.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on,  </div><div class='q'>And as a girdle with which he girds himself continually.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me,  </div><div class='q'>And of them that speak evil against my soul.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal <span class='add'>mercifully</span> with me, for thy name’s sake:  </div><div class='q'>For thy mercy is good.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Deliver me, for I am poor and needy;  </div><div class='q'>And my heart is troubled within me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>I am removed as a shadow in its going down:  </div><div class='q'>I am tossed up and down like locusts.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>My knees are weakened through fasting,  </div><div class='q'>And my flesh is changed by reason of <span class='add'>the want of</span> oil.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I became also a reproach to them:  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>When</span> they saw me they shook their heads.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Help me, O Lord my God;  </div><div class='q'>And save me according to thy mercy.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And let them know that this is thy hand;  </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>that</span> thou, Lord, hast wrought it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let them curse, but thou shalt bless:  </div><div class='q'>Let them that rise up against me be ashamed,  </div><div class='q'>But let thy servant rejoice.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame,  </div><div class='q'>And let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth;  </div><div class='q'>And in the midst of many I will praise him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For he stood on the right hand of the poor,  </div><div class='q'>To save <span class='add'>me</span> from them that persecute my soul.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
