And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no child.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the man went up from year to year from his city, from Ramah, to worship and sacrifice to the Lord God of Sabaoth at Shiloh: and <span class='add'>there were</span> Eli and his two sons Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the day came, and Elkanah sacrificed, and gave portions to his wife Peninnah and her children.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And to Hannah he gave a prime portion, because she had no child, only Elkanah loved Hannah more than the other; but the Lord <span class='add'>had</span> closed her womb.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the Lord gave her no child in her affliction, and according to the despondency of her affliction; and she was dispirited on this account, that the Lord shut up her womb so as not to give her a child.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So she did year by year, in going up to the house of the Lord; and she was dispirited, and wept, and did not eat.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah: and she said to him, Here <span class='add'>am</span> I, my lord: and he said to her, What ails thee that thou weepest?

take away thy wine from thee, and go out from the presence of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hannah answered and said, Nay, my lord, <span class='add'>I live</span> in a hard day, and I have not drunk wine or strong drink, and I pour out my soul before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Count not thy handmaid for a pestilent woman, for by reason of the abundance of my importunity I have continued <span class='add'>my prayer</span> until now.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Eli answered and said to her, Go in peace: the God of Israel give thee all thy petition, which thou hast asked of him.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And she said, Thine handmaid has found favor in thine eyes: and the woman went her way, and entered into her lodging, and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was no more sad.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they rise early in the morning, and worship the Lord, and they go their way: and Elkanah went into his house at Ramah, and knew his wife Hannah; and the Lord remembered her, and she conceived.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the time was come, that she brought forth a son, and called his name Samuel, and said, Because I asked him of the Lord God of Sabaoth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer in Shiloh the yearly sacrifice, and his vows, and all the tithes of his land.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But Hannah did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, <span class='add'>I will not go up</span> until the child goes up, when I have weaned him, and he shall be presented before the Lord, and he shall abide there continually.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do that which is good in thine eyes, abide still until thou shalt have weaned him; but may the Lord establish that which comes out of thy mouth: and the woman tarried, and suckled her son until she had weaned him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And she went up with him to Shiloh with a calf of three years old, and loaves, and an ephah of fine flour, and a bottle of wine: and she entered into the house of the Lord in Shiloh, and the child with them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they brought him before the Lord; and his father slew his offering which he offered from year to year to the Lord; and he brought near the child, and slew the calf; and Hannah the mother of the child brought him to Eli.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And she said, I pray thee, my lord, as thy soul liveth, I <span class='add'>am</span> the woman that stood in thy presence with thee while praying to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For this child I prayed; and the Lord has given me my request that I asked of him.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I lend him to the Lord all his days that he lives, a loan to the Lord: and she said,   </div><ul class='tnav'>
