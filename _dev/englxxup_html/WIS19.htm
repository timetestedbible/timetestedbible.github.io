<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy unto the end:  </div><div class='q'>For he knew before what they would do;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>How that having given them leave to depart,  </div><div class='q'>And sent them hastily away,  </div><div class='q'>They would repent and pursue them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For while they were yet mourning  </div><div class='q'>And making lamentation at the graves of the dead,  </div><div class='q'>They added another foolish device,  </div><div class='q'>And pursued them as fugitives, whom they had entreated to be gone.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them unto this end,  </div><div class='q'>And made them forget the things that had already happened,  </div><div class='q'>That they might fulfill the punishment which was wanting to their torments:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And that thy people might pass through a wonderful way:  </div><div class='q'>But they might find a strange death.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned again anew,  </div><div class='q'>Serving the peculiar commandments that were given unto them,  </div><div class='q'>That thy children might be kept without hurt:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span><span class='add'>As namely</span>, a cloud shadowing the camp;  </div><div class='q'>And where water stood before, dry land appeared;  </div><div class='q'>And out of the Red Sea a way without impediment;  </div><div class='q'>And out of the violent stream a green field:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Through which all the people went that were defended with thy hand,  </div><div class='q'>Seeing thy marvelous strange wonders.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For they went at large like horses,  </div><div class='q'>And leaped like lambs, praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For they were yet mindful of the things that were done while they sojourned in the strange land,  </div><div class='q'>How the ground brought forth flies instead of cattle,  </div><div class='q'>And how the river cast up a multitude of frogs instead of fish.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But afterward they saw a new generation of fowls,  </div><div class='q'>When, being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For quails came up unto them from the sea for their contentment.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And punishments came upon the sinners  </div><div class='q'>Not without former signs by the force of thunders:  </div><div class='q'>For they suffered justly according to their own wickedness,  </div><div class='q'>Insomuch as they used a more hard and hateful behavior toward strangers.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the <span class='add'>Sodomites</span> did not receive those, whom they knew not when they came:  </div><div class='q'>But these brought friends into bondage, that had well deserved of them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be had of those,  </div><div class='q'>Because they used strangers not friendly:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But these very grievously afflicted them,  </div><div class='q'>Whom they had received with feastings,  </div><div class='q'>And were already made partakers of the same laws with them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore even with blindness were these stricken,  </div><div class='q'>As those were at the doors of the righteous man:  </div><div class='q'>When, being compassed about with horrible great darkness,  </div><div class='q'>Every one sought the passage of his own doors.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind of harmony,  </div><div class='q'>Like as in a psaltery notes change the name of the tune,  </div><div class='q'>And yet are always sounds;  </div><div class='q'>Which may well be perceived by the sight of the things that have been done.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For earthly things were turned into watery,  </div><div class='q'>And the things, that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue:  </div><div class='q'>And the water forgot his own quenching nature.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of the corruptible living things,  </div><div class='q'>Though they walked therein;  </div><div class='q'>Neither melted they the icy kind of heavenly meat, that was of nature apt to melt.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, and glorify them,  </div><div class='q'>Neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didst assist them in every time and place.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
