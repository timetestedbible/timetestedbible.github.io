<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God: ye shall not make to yourselves gods made with hands, or graven; neither shall ye rear up a pillar for yourselves, neither shall ye set up a stone <span class='add'>for</span> an object in your land to worship it: I am the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Ye shall keep my Sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuaries: I am the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If ye will walk in my ordinances, and keep my commandments, and do them,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>then will I give you the rain in its season, and the land shall produce its fruits, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your threshing time shall overtake the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake your seed time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full; and ye shall dwell safely upon your land, and war shall not go through your land.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will give peace in your land, and ye shall sleep, and none <span class='add'>shall</span> make you afraid; and I will destroy the evil beasts out of your land,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and ye shall pursue your enemies, and they shall fall before you with slaughter.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase tens of thousands; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will look upon you, and increase you, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And ye shall eat that which is old and very old, and bring forth the old to make way for the new.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I will set my tabernacle among you, and my soul shall not abhor you;   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and I will walk among you, and be your God, and ye shall be my people.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, where ye were slaves; and I broke the band of your yoke, and brought you forth openly.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But if ye will not hearken to me, nor obey these my ordinances,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>but disobey them, and your soul should loathe my judgments, so that ye should not keep all my commands, so as to break my covenant,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>then will I do thus to you: I will even bring upon you perplexity and the itch, and the fever that causes your eyes to waste away, and <span class='add'>disease</span> that consumes your life; and ye shall sow your seeds in vain, and your enemies shall eat them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And I will set my face against you, and ye shall fall before your enemies, and they that hate you shall pursue you; and ye shall flee, no one pursuing you.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And if ye still refuse to hearken to me, then will I chasten you yet more even seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will break down the haughtiness of your pride; and I will make your heaven iron, and your earth as it were brass.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And your strength shall be in vain; and your land shall not yield its seed, and the tree of your field shall not yield its fruit.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if after this ye should walk perversely, and not be willing to obey me, I will further bring upon you seven plagues according to your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And I will send upon you the wild beasts of the land, and they shall devour you, and shall consume your cattle: and I will make you few in number, and your ways shall be desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if hereupon ye are not corrected, but walk perversely toward me,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I also will walk with you with a perverse spirit, and I also will smite you seven times for your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I will bring upon you a sword avenging the cause of <span class='add'>my</span> covenant, and ye shall flee for refuge to your cities; and I will send out death against you, and ye shall be delivered into the hands of your enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When I afflict you with famine of bread, then ten women shall bake your loaves in one oven, and they shall render your loaves by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if hereupon ye will not obey me, but walk perversely toward me,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>then will I walk with you with a froward mind, and I will chasten you sevenfold according to your sins.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And I will render your pillars desolate, and will utterly destroy your wooden <span class='add'>images</span> made with hands; and I will lay your carcasses on the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall loathe you.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And I will lay your cities waste, and I will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell the savor of your sacrifices.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And I will lay your land desolate, and your enemies who dwell in it shall wonder at it.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And I will scatter you among the nations, and the sword shall come upon you and consume you; and your land shall be desolate, and your cities shall be desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days of its desolation.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And ye shall be in the land of your enemies; then the land shall keep its Sabbaths, and the land shall enjoy its Sabbaths all the days of its desolation: it shall keep Sabbaths which it kept not among your Sabbaths, when ye dwelt in it.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And to those who are left of you I will bring bondage into their heart in the land of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as fleeing from war, and shall fall when none pursues them.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And brother shall disregard brother as in war, when none pursues; and ye shall not be able to withstand your enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And ye shall perish among the Gentiles, and the land of your enemies shall devour you.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And those who are left of you shall perish, because of their sins, and because of the sins of their fathers: in the land of their enemies shall they consume away.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And they shall confess their sins, and the sins of their fathers, that they have transgressed and neglected me, and that they have walked perversely before me,   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>and I walked with them with a perverse mind; and I will destroy them in the land of their enemies: then shall their uncircumcised heart be ashamed, and then shall they acquiesce in <span class='add'>the punishment of</span> their sins.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And I will remember the covenant of Jacob, and the covenant of Isaac, and the covenant of Abraham will I remember.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And I will remember the land, and the land shall be left of them; then the land shall enjoy her Sabbaths, when it is deserted through them: and they shall accept <span class='add'>the punishment of</span> their iniquities, because they neglected my judgments, and in their soul loathed my ordinances.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And yet not even thus, while they were in the land of their enemies, did I overlook them, nor did I loathe them so as to consume them, to break my covenant made with them; for I am the Lord their God.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And I will remember their former covenant, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage before the nations, to be their God; I am the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>These are my judgments and my ordinances, and the law which the Lord gave between himself and the children of Israel, in the Mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
