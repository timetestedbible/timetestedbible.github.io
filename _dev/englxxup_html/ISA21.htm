The Elamites are upon me, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort myself.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hastened that I might not see.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare <span class='add'>your</span> shields.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias to the watchtower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all the night:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Hear, ye that are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts <span class='add'>which</span> the God of Israel has declared to us.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The vision of Edom.  </div><div class='p'>Call to me out of Seir; guard ye the bulwarks.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I watch in the morning and the night: if thou wouldest inquire, inquire, and dwell by me.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening, or in the way of Dedan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Ye that dwell in the country of Tema, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of a hireling, <span class='add'>and</span> the glory of the sons of Kedar shall fail:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken <span class='add'>it</span>.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
