So be it.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For thou hast made cities a heap, <span class='add'>even</span> cities <span class='add'>made</span> strong that their foundations should not fall: the city of ungodly men shall not be built forever.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore shall the poor people bless thee, and cities of injured men shall bless thee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thou hast been a helper to every lowly city, and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: thou shalt deliver them from wicked men: <span class='add'>thou hast been</span> a shelter of them that thirst, and a refreshing air to injured men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span><span class='add'>We were</span> as faint-hearted men thirsting in Zion, by reason of ungodly men to whom thou didst deliver us.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord of hosts shall make <span class='add'>a feast</span> for all the nations: on this mount they shall drink gladness, they shall drink wine:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this mountain. Impart thou all these things to the nations; for this is <span class='add'>God’s</span> counsel upon all the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Death has prevailed and swallowed <span class='add'>men</span> up; but again the Lord God has taken away every tear from every face. He has taken away the reproach of <span class='add'>his</span> people from all the earth: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And in that day they shall say, Behold our God in whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord; we have waited for him, and we have exulted, and will rejoice in our salvation.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>God will give rest on this mountain, and the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with wagons.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he shall spread forth his hands, even as he also brings down <span class='add'>man</span> to destroy <span class='add'>him</span>: and he shall bring low his pride <span class='add'>in regard to the thing</span> on which he has laid his hands.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he shall bring down the height of the refuge of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
