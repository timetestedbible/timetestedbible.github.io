Let not the name of our father be blotted out of the midst of his people, because he has no son: give us an inheritance in the midst of our father’s brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Moses brought their case before the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The daughters of Zelophehad have spoken rightly: thou shalt surely give them a possession of inheritance in the midst of their father’s brethren, and thou shalt assign their father’s inheritance to them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If a man die, and have no son, ye shall assign his inheritance to his daughter.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if he have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance to his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And if he have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance to his father’s brother.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And if there be no brethren of his father, ye shall give the inheritance to his nearest relation of his tribe, to inherit his possessions; and this shall be to the children of Israel an ordinance of judgment, as the Lord commanded Moses.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Go up to the mountain that is in the country beyond Jordan, this Mount Nebo, and behold the land Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt see it, and thou also shalt be added to thy people, as Aaron thy brother was added <span class='add'>to them</span> in Mount Hor:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>because ye transgressed my commandment in the wilderness of Zin, when the congregation resisted <span class='add'>and refused</span> to sanctify me; ye sanctified me not at the water before them. This is the water of Strife in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Moses said to the Lord,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let the Lord God of spirits and of all flesh look out for a man over this congregation,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>who shall go out before them, and who shall come in before them, and who shall lead them out, and who shall bring them in; so the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep without a shepherd.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Take to thyself Joshua the son of Nun, a man who has the Spirit in him, and thou shalt lay thy hands upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt set him before Eleazar the priest, and thou shalt give him a charge before all the congregation, and thou shalt give a charge concerning him before them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt put of thy glory upon him, that the children of Israel may hearken to him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and they shall ask of him before the Lord the judgment of the Urim: they shall go forth at his word, and at his word they shall come in, he and the children of Israel with one accord, and all the congregation.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses did as the Lord commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he laid his hands on him, and appointed him as the Lord ordered Moses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
