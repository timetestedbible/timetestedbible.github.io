  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and give you all a heart to serve him, and to do his will, with a good courage and a willing mind;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and open your hearts in his law and commandments, and send you peace,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and never forsake you in time of trouble.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And now we be here praying for you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore and ninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity of trouble that came upon us in those years, from the time that Jason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayed unto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices and fine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in the month Chislev.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people that were at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sent greeting and health unto Aristobulus, King Ptolemy’s master, who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jews that were in Egypt:   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thank him highly, as having been in battle against a king.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For he cast them out that fought within the holy city.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army with him that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple of Nanea by the deceit of Nanea’s priests.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into the place, and his friends that were with him, to receive money in name of a dowry.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he was entered with a small company into the compass of the temple, they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come in:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>and opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones like thunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces, smote off their heads, and cast them to those that were without.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up the ungodly.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of <span class='add'>the month</span> Chislev, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye also might keep <span class='add'>it, as the feast</span> of the tabernacles, and of the fire, <span class='add'>which was given us</span> when Nehemiah offered sacrifice, after that he had built the temple and the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests that were then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid it in a hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept <span class='add'>it</span> sure, so that the place was unknown to all men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Now after many years, when it pleased God, Nehemiah, being sent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of those priests that had hidden it to the fire: but when they told us they found no fire, but thick water;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; and when the sacrifices were laid on, Nehemiah commanded the priests to sprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with the water.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone, which afore was hidden in the cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that every man marveled.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the priests made a prayer while the sacrifice was consuming, <span class='add'>I say</span>, both the priests, and all <span class='add'>the rest</span>, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Nehemiah did.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the prayer was after this manner: O Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, and righteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King,   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>the only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, and everlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, and didst choose the fathers, and sanctify them:   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, and preserve thine own portion, and sanctify it.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliver them that serve among the heathen, look upon them that are despised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou art our God.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Punish them that oppress us, and with pride do us wrong.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Nehemiah commanded the water that was left to be poured on the great stones.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>So when this matter was known, it was told the king of Persia, that in the place, where the priests that were led away had hidden the fire, there appeared water, and that Nehemiah had purified the sacrifices therewith.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Then the king, enclosing the place, made it holy, after he had tried the matter.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on those whom he would gratify.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Nehemiah called this thing Nephthar, which is as much as to say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephtha.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
