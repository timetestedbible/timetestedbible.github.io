and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Heshbon.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the Lord our God delivered him into our hands, even Og the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until we left none of his seed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And we mastered all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country round about Argob, belonging to King Og in Bashan:   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars; besides the very many cities of the Perizzites.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We utterly destroyed <span class='add'>them</span> as we dealt with Sihon the king of Heshbon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the women and the children,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and all the cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And we took at that time the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, <span class='add'>extending</span> from the brook of Arnon even unto Hermon.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The Phoenicians call Hermon Sirion, but the Amorite has called it Senir.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>All the cities of Misor, and all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the Rephaim: behold, his bed <span class='add'>was</span> a bed of iron; behold, <span class='add'>it is</span> in the chief city of the children of Ammon; the length of it <span class='add'>is</span> nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to the cubit of a man.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And we inherited that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Gilead; and I gave his cities to Reuben and to Gad.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, and all the country round about Argob, all that Bashan; it shall be accounted the land of Rephaim.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Geshur and Maacath: he called them by his name Bashan-havvoth-jair until this day.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And to Machir I gave Gilead.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to Reuben and to Gad I gave <span class='add'>the land</span> under Gilead as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook and as far as Jabbok; the brook <span class='add'>is</span> the border to the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Arabah and Jordan <span class='add'>are</span> the boundary of Chinnereth, even to the Sea of Arabah, the salt sea under Asedoth Pisgah eastward.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I charged you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm yourselves, every one <span class='add'>that is</span> powerful, and go before your brethren the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Only your wives and your children and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), let them dwell in your cities which I have given you;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>until the Lord your God give your brethren rest, as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then ye shall return, each one to his inheritance which I have given you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which thou crossest over thither.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Ye shall not be afraid of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Lord God, thou hast begun to show to thy servant thy strength, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as thou hast done, and according to thy might?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I will therefore go over and see this good land that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilebanon.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord because of you did not regard me, and hearkened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice thee, speak not of this matter to me anymore.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Go up to the top of the quarried rock, and look with thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <span class='add'>it</span> with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go before the face of this people, and he shall give them the inheritance of all the land which thou hast seen.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And we abode in the valley near the house of Peor.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
