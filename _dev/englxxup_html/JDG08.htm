Then was their spirit calmed toward him, when he spoke this word.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Gideon came to Jordan, and went over, himself and the three hundred with him, hungry, yet pursuing.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said to the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed this people that follow me; because they are faint, and behold, I am following after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the princes of Succoth said, <span class='add'>Are</span> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy host?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Gideon said, Therefore when the Lord gives Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then will I tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and the Barkenim.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth <span class='add'>had</span> answered him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Gideon said to the men of Penuel, When I return in peace, I will break down this tower.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Zebah and Zalmunna <span class='add'>were</span> in Karkor, and their host <span class='add'>was</span> with them, about fifteen thousand, all that were left of all the host of the aliens; and they that fell <span class='add'>were</span> a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents, eastward of Nobah and Jogbehah; and he smote the host, and the host was secure.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the army.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle, down from the battle of Heres.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he took prisoner a young lad of the men of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote to him the names of the princes of Succoth and of their elders, seventy-seven men.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Gideon came to the princes of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom ye reproached me, saying, <span class='add'>Are</span> the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy men that are faint?
