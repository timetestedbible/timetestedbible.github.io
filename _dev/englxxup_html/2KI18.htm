And the king of Assyria laid upon Hezekiah king of Judah <span class='add'>a tribute of</span> three hundred talents of silver, and thirty talents of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah gave all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>At that time Hezekiah cut off <span class='add'>the gold from</span> the doors of the temple, and <span class='add'>from</span> the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah <span class='add'>had</span> overlaid with gold, and gave it to the king of the Assyrians.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king of the Assyrians sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a strong force against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem, and stood by the aqueduct of the upper pool, which is by the way of the fuller’s field.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they cried to Hezekiah: and there came to him Eliakim the son of Hilkiah the steward, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Rabshakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says the king, the great king of the Assyrians, What <span class='add'>is</span> this confidence wherein thou trustest?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Thou hast said (but <span class='add'>they are</span> mere words), <span class='add'>I have</span> counsel and strength for war.
