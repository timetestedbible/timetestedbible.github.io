 <div class='mt'>Wisdom of the Son of Sirach  </div><div class='mt2'>(Ecclesiasticus)   
</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='d'><span class='add'>The Prologue to the Wisdom of</span> Jesus <span class='add'>the son of</span> Sirach </div> <div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span><span class='sc'>Whereas</span> many and great things have been delivered unto us by the law and the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and wisdom: and whereof not only the readers must needs become skillful themselves,   <span class="verse" id="V2">1a&#160;</span>but also they that desire to learn be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and by writing: my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to the reading of the law, and the prophets,   <span class="verse" id="V3">1b&#160;</span>and other books of our fathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on also himself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; to the intent that those which are desirous to learn, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in living according to the law.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">1c&#160;</span>Wherefore let me entreat you to read it with favor and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seem to come short of some words,   <span class="verse" id="V5">1d&#160;</span>which we have labored to interpret; for the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translated into another tongue, have not the same force in them. And not only these things, but the law itself, and the prophets,   <span class="verse" id="V6">1e&#160;</span>and the rest of the books, have no small difference, when they are spoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtieth year coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuing there some time, I found a book of no small learning:   <span class="verse" id="V7">1f&#160;</span>therefore I thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence and travail to interpret it: using great watchfulness and skill in that space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth for them also, which in a strange country are willing to learn,   <span class="verse" id="V8">1g&#160;</span>being prepared before in manners to live after the law.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">1h&#160;</span>All wisdom <span class='add'>cometh</span> from the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And is with him forever.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain,  </div><div class='q'>And the days of eternity?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And the deep, and wisdom?   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Wisdom hath been created before all things,  </div><div class='q'>And the understanding of prudence from everlasting.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed?
