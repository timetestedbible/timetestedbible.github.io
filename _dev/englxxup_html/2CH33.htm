And all his sins, and his backslidings, and the spots on which he built the high places, and set there groves and graven images, before he repented, behold, they are written in the books of the seers.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the garden of his house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh did: and Amon sacrificed to all the idols which his father Manasseh had made, and served them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he was not humbled before the Lord as his father Manasseh was humbled; for his son Amon abounded in transgression.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his house.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the people of the land slew the men who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
