<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 68</div><div class='d'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For the end, <span class='add'>a Psalm</span> of David, for alternate <span class='add'>strains</span>.  </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Save me, O God; for the waters have come in to my soul.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I am stuck fast in deep mire, and there is no standing:  </div><div class='q'>I am come in to the depths of the sea, and a storm has overwhelmed me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I am weary <span class='add'>of</span> crying, my throat has become hoarse;  </div><div class='q'>Mine eyes have failed by my waiting on my God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:  </div><div class='q'>My enemies that persecute me unrighteously are strengthened:  </div><div class='q'>Then I restored that which I took not away.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>O God, thou knowest my foolishness;  </div><div class='q'>And my transgressions are not hidden from thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord of hosts, be ashamed on my account: let not them that seek thee, be ashamed on my account, O God of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For I have suffered reproach for thy sake;  </div><div class='q'>Shame has covered my face.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I became strange to my brethren,  </div><div class='q'>And a stranger to my mother’s children.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the zeal of thy house has eaten me up;  </div><div class='q'>And the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I bowed down my soul with fasting,  </div><div class='q'>And that was made my reproach.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I put on sackcloth for my covering;  </div><div class='q'>And I became a proverb to them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They that sit in the gate talked against me,  </div><div class='q'>And they that drank wine sang against me.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But I <span class='add'>will cry</span> to thee, O Lord, in my prayer;  </div><div class='q'>O God, it is a propitious time: in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,  </div><div class='q'>In the truth of thy salvation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Save me from the mire, that I stick not <span class='add'>in it</span>:  </div><div class='q'>Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and from the deep waters.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let not the waterflood drown me,  </div><div class='q'>Nor let the deep swallow me up;  </div><div class='q'>Neither let the well shut its mouth upon me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Hear me, O Lord; for thy mercy is good:  </div><div class='q'>According to the multitude of thy compassions look upon me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And turn not away thy face from thy servant;  </div><div class='q'>For I am afflicted: hear me speedily.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Draw nigh to my soul and redeem it:  </div><div class='q'>Deliver me because of mine enemies.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For thou knowest my reproach,  </div><div class='q'>And my shame, and my confusion;  </div><div class='q'>All that afflict me are before thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>My soul has waited for reproach and misery;  </div><div class='q'>And I waited for one to grieve with me, but there was none;  </div><div class='q'>And for one to comfort me, but I found none.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>They gave <span class='add'>me</span> also gall for my food,  </div><div class='q'>And made me drink vinegar for my thirst.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Let their table before them be for a snare,  </div><div class='q'>And for a recompense, and for a stumbling block.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Let their eyes be darkened that they should not see;  </div><div class='q'>And bow down their back continually.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Pour out thy wrath upon them,  </div><div class='q'>And let the fury of thine anger take hold on them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let their habitation be made desolate;  </div><div class='q'>And let there be no inhabitant in their tents:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Because they persecuted him whom thou hast smitten;  </div><div class='q'>And they have added to the grief of my wounds.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Add iniquity to their iniquity;  </div><div class='q'>And let them not come into thy righteousness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,  </div><div class='q'>And let them not be written with the righteous.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>I am poor and sorrowful;  </div><div class='q'>But the salvation of thy countenance has helped me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>I will praise the name of my God with a song,  </div><div class='q'>I will magnify him with praise;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>this</span> shall please God more than a young calf  </div><div class='q'>Having horns and hoofs.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Let the poor see and rejoice;  </div><div class='q'>Seek the Lord diligently, and ye shall live.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>For the Lord hears the poor,  </div><div class='q'>And does not set at nought his fettered ones.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Let the heavens and the earth praise him,  </div><div class='q'>The sea, and all things moving in them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>For God will save Zion,  </div><div class='q'>And the cities of Judea shall be built;  </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>men</span> shall dwell there, and inherit it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the seed of his servants shall possess it,  </div><div class='q'>And they that love his name shall dwell therein.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
