Then Moses was alarmed, and said, If <span class='add'>it be</span> thus, this matter has become known.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Pharaoh heard this matter, and sought to slay Moses; and Moses departed from the presence of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian; and having come into the land of Midian, he sat on the well.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the priest of Midian had seven daughters, feeding the flock of their father Jethro; and they came and drew water until they filled their pitchers, to water the flock of their father Jethro.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the shepherds came, and were driving them away; and Moses rose up and rescued them, and drew water for them, and watered their sheep.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they came to Reuel their father; and he said to them, Why have ye come so quickly today?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the shepherds, and drew water for us and watered our sheep.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? and why have ye left the man? call him therefore, that he may eat bread.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Moses was established with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the woman conceived and bore a son, and Moses called his name Gershom, saying, I am a sojourner in a strange land.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And in those days after a length of time, the king of Egypt died; and the children of Israel groaned because of their tasks, and cried, and their cry because of their tasks went up to God.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And God heard their groanings, and God remembered his covenant made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And God looked upon the children of Israel, and was made known to them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
