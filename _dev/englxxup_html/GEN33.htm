Esau his brother coming, and four hundred men with him; and Jacob divided the children to Leah and to Rachel, and the two handmaids.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he put the two handmaids and their children with the first, and Leah and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But he advanced himself before them, and did reverence to the ground seven times, until he drew near to his brother.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Esau ran on to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him; and they both wept.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to thee? And he said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed thy servant.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the maidservants and their children drew near and did reverence.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Leah and her children drew near and did reverence; and after this drew near Rachel and Joseph, and did reverence.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said, What are these things to thee, all these companies that I have met? And he said, That thy servant might find grace in thy sight, my lord.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Esau said, I have much, my brother; keep thine own.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jacob said, If I have found grace in thy sight, receive the gifts through my hands; therefore have I seen thy face, as if anyone should see the face of God, and thou shalt be well pleased with me.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Receive my blessings, which I have brought thee, because God has had mercy on me, and I have all things; and he constrained him, and he took <span class='add'>them</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said, Let us depart, and proceed right onward.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to him, My lord knows, that the children are very tender, and the flocks and the herds with me are with young; if then I shall drive them hard one day, all the cattle will die.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let my lord go on before his servant, and I shall have strength on the road according to the ease of the journey before me, and according to the strength of the children, until I come to my lord to Seir.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Esau said, I will leave with thee some of the people who are with me. And he said, Why so? it is enough that I have found favor before thee, <span class='add'>my</span> lord.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Esau returned on that day on his journey to Seir.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jacob departs to his tents; and he made for himself there habitations, and for his cattle he made booths; therefore he called the name of that place, Booths.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jacob came to Salem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he departed out of Mesopotamia of Syria, and took up a position in front of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he bought the portion of the field, where he pitched his tent, of Hamor the father of Shechem, for a hundred lambs.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he set up there an altar, and called on the God of Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
