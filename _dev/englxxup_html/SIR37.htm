 </div><div class='q'>For he will counsel for himself;  </div><div class='q'>Lest he cast the lot upon thee,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And say unto thee, Thy way is good:  </div><div class='q'>And afterward he stand on the other side, to see what shall befall thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Consult not with one that suspecteth thee:  </div><div class='q'>And hide thy counsel from such as envy thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Neither consult with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous;  </div><div class='q'>Neither with a coward in matters of war;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with a merchant concerning exchange;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with a buyer of selling;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with an envious man of thankfulness;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with an unmerciful man touching kindness;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with the slothful for any work;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with a hireling for a year of finishing work;  </div><div class='q'>Nor with an idle servant of much business:  </div><div class='q'>Hearken not unto these in any matter of counsel.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But be continually with a godly man,  </div><div class='q'>Whom thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>Whose mind is according to thy mind,  </div><div class='q'>And will sorrow with thee, if thou shalt miscarry.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And let the counsel of thine own heart stand:  </div><div class='q'>For there is no man more faithful unto thee than it;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For a man’s mind is sometime wont to tell him more  </div><div class='q'>Than seven watchmen, that sit above in a high tower.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And above all this pray to the most High,  </div><div class='q'>That he will direct thy way in truth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let reason go before every enterprize,  </div><div class='q'>And counsel before every action.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
