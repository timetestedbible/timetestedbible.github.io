  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Is the sin of Peor too little for you, whereas we have not been cleansed from it until this day, though there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye have this day revolted from the Lord; and it shall come to pass if ye revolt this day from the Lord, that tomorrow there shall be wrath upon all Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now if the land of your possession <span class='add'>be too</span> little, cross over to the land of the possession of the Lord, where the tabernacle of the Lord dwells, and receive ye an inheritance among us; and do not become apostates from God, neither do ye apostatize from the Lord, because of your having built an altar apart from the altar of the Lord our God.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Lo! did not Achan the <span class='add'>son</span> of Zerah commit a trespass <span class='add'>taking</span> of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>God <span class='add'>even</span> God is the Lord, and God <span class='add'>even</span> God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole burnt offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace offering—the Lord shall require it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But we have done this for the sake of precaution <span class='add'>concerning this</span> thing, saying, Lest hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and ye have no portion in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And we gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt offerings, nor for meat offerings;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt offerings and our meat offerings and our peace offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, Ye have no portion in the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak <span class='add'>so</span> to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt offerings, nor for the sake of meat offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt offerings, and for peace offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Phinehas the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him heard the words which the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh spoke; and it pleased them.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Phinehas the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Today we know that the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with us, because ye have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So Phinehas the priest and the princes departed from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasseh out of Gilead into the land of Canaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against the others to destroy the land of the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh: so they dwelt upon it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasseh; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
