 </div><div class='q'>And for his neighbor’s money he will speak submissively:  </div><div class='q'>But when he should repay, he will prolong the time,  </div><div class='q'>And return words of grief,  </div><div class='q'>And complain of the time.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>If he prevail, he shall hardly receive the half,  </div><div class='q'>And he will count as if he had found it:  </div><div class='q'>If not, he hath deprived him of his money,  </div><div class='q'>And he hath gotten him an enemy without cause:  </div><div class='q'>He payeth him with cursings and railings;
