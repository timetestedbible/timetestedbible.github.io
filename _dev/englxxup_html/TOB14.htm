<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So Tobit made an end of praising God.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when he was very aged, he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Go into Media, my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonah the prophet spoke of Nineveh, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from <span class='add'>all</span> places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, showing mercy to our brethren.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now, my son, depart out of Nineveh, because that those things which the prophet Jonah spoke shall surely come to pass.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But keep thou the law and the commandments, and show thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineveh. Remember, my son, how Nadab handled Ahikar that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Ahikar was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasseh gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Nadab fell into the snare, and perished.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being a hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honorably.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father.  </div><div class='p'>But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatana to Raguel his father-in-law,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>where he became old with honor; and he buried his father and mother-in-law honorably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit’s.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he died at Ecbatana in Media, being a hundred and seven and twenty years old.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineveh, which was taken by Nebuchadnezzar and Ahasuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineveh.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
