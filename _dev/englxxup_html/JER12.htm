Why <span class='add'>is it</span> that the way of ungodly <span class='add'>men</span> prospers? <span class='add'>that</span> all that deal very treacherously are flourishing?   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root; they have begotten children, and become fruitful; thou art near to their mouth, and far from their reins.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But thou, Lord, knowest me; thou hast proved my heart before thee; purify them for the day of their slaughter.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>How long shall the land mourn, and the grass of the field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell in it? the beasts and birds are utterly destroyed; because <span class='add'>the people</span> said, God shall not see our ways.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thy feet run, and they cause thee to faint; how wilt thou prepare <span class='add'>to ride</span> upon horses? and thou hast been confident in the land of thy peace? how wilt thou do in the roaring of Jordan?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, even these have dealt treacherously with thee; and they have cried out, they are gathered together in pursuit of thee; trust not thou in them, though they shall speak fair <span class='add'>words</span> to thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given my beloved one into the hands of her enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>My inheritance has become to me as a lion in a forest; she has uttered her voice against me; therefore have I hated her.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Is not my inheritance to me a hyena’s cave, or a cave round about her? Go ye, gather together all the wild beasts of the field, and let them come to devour her.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desirable portion a trackless wilderness;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>it is made a complete ruin: for my sake the whole land has been utterly ruined, because there is none that lays <span class='add'>the matter</span> to heart.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The ravagers are come to every passage in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other: no flesh has any peace.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Sow wheat, and reap thorns; their portions shall not profit them: be ashamed of your boasting, because of reproach before the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord concerning all the evil neighbors that touch mine inheritance, which I have divided to my people Israel; Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> draw them away from their land, and I will cast out Judah from the midst of them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, after I have cast them out, <span class='add'>that</span> I will return, and have mercy upon them, and will cause them to dwell every one in his inheritance, and every one in his land.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it shall be, if they will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name, <span class='add'>saying</span>, The Lord lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall <span class='add'>that nation</span> be built in the midst of my people.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if they will not return, then will I cut off that nation with utter ruin and destruction.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
