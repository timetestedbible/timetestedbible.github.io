And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Today is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing <span class='add'>woman</span>, but she has not strength to bring forth.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabshakeh, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Libnah: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Tirhakah king of the Ethiopians went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thus shall ye say to Hezekiah king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, which are in the land of Theemath?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where are the kings of Hamath? and where <span class='add'>is the king of</span> Arpad? and where <span class='add'>is the king</span> of the city of Sepharvaim, <span class='add'>and of</span> Anagugana?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and have cast their idols into the fire: for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that thou art God alone.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Isaiah the son of Amoz was sent to Hezekiah, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Zion has despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers; for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Lebanon; and I have cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Hast thou not heard of these things which I did of old?
