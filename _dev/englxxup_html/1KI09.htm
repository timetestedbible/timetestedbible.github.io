And he said,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>What <span class='add'>are</span> these cities which thou hast given me, brother? And he called them Boundary until this day.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Hiram brought to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>even that for which King Solomon built a ship in Ezion-geber near Eloth on the shore of the extremity of the sea in the land of Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Hiram sent in the ship together with the servants of Solomon servants of his own, mariners to row, men acquainted with the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they came to Ophir, and took thence a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought them to King Solomon.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
