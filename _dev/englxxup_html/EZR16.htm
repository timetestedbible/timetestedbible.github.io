<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall, and <span class='add'>that</span> there was no opening left therein (<span class='add'>but</span> hitherto I had not set up the doors on the gates);   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, Come and let us meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono. But they <span class='add'>were</span> plotting to do me mischief.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, and I shall not be able to come down, lest the work should cease: as soon as I shall have finished it, I will come down to you.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they sent to me <span class='add'>again</span> to this effect; and I sent them <span class='add'>word</span> accordingly.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And in it was written, It has been reported among the Gentiles that thou and the Jews are planning to revolt: therefore thou art building the wall, and thou wilt be a king to them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And moreover thou hast appointed prophets to thyself, that thou mightest dwell in Jerusalem as a king over Judah: and now these words will be reported to the king. Now then, come, let us take counsel together.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I sent to him, saying, It has not happened according to these words, <span class='add'>even</span> as thou sayest, for thou framest them falsely out of thy heart.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For all were trying to alarm us, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from this work, and it shall not be done. Now therefore I have strengthened my hands.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I came into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, and he was shut up; and he said, Let us assemble together in the house of God, in the midst of it, and let us shut the doors of it; for they are coming by night to slay thee.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I said, Who is the man that shall enter into the house, that he may live?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I observed, and, behold, God had not sent him, for the prophecy was a fable <span class='add'>devised</span> against me:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired against me a multitude, that I might be frightened, and do this, and sin, and become to them an ill name, that they might reproach me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Remember, O God, Tobiah and Sanballat, according to these their deeds, and the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets who tried to alarm me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the <span class='add'>month</span> Elul, in fifty-two days.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, that all the nations round about us feared, and great alarm fell upon them, and they knew that it was of our God that this work should be finished.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And in those days letters came to Tobiah from many nobles of Judah, and those of Tobiah came to them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For many in Judah were bound to him by oath, because he was son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and Jehohanan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they reported his words to me, and carried out my words to him: and Tobiah sent letters to terrify me.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
