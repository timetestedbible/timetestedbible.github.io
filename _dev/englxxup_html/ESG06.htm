And the king’s servants said, Thou hast not done anything to him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And while the king was inquiring about the kindness of Mordecai, behold, Haman <span class='add'>was</span> in the court. And the king said, Who <span class='add'>is</span> in the court? Now Haman was come in to speak to the king, that he should hang Mordecai on the gallows, which he had prepared.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the king’s servants said, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Call him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the king said to Haman, What shall I do to the man whom I wish to honor? And Haman said within himself, Whom would the king honor but myself?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and he said to the king, As for the man whom the king wishes to honor,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>let the king’s servants bring the robe of fine linen which the king puts on, and the horse on which the king rides,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and let him give <span class='add'>it</span> to one of the king’s noble friends, and let him array the man whom the king loves; and let him mount him on the horse, and proclaim through the street of the city, saying, Thus shall it be <span class='add'>done</span> to every man whom the king honors.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then the king said to Haman, Thou hast well said: so do to Mordecai the Jew, who waits in the palace, and let not a word of what thou hast spoken be neglected.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Haman took the robe and the horse, and arrayed Mordecai, and mounted him on the horse, and went through the street of the city, and proclaimed, saying, Thus shall it be to every man whom the king wishes to honor.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Mordecai returned to the palace: but Haman went home mourning, and having his head covered.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Haman related the events that had befallen him to Zeresh his wife, and to <span class='add'>his</span> friends: and his friends and his wife said to him, If Mordecai <span class='add'>be</span> of the race of the Jews, <span class='add'>and</span> thou hast begun to be humbled before him, thou wilt assuredly fall, and thou wilt not be able to withstand him, for the living God <span class='add'>is</span> with him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>While they were yet speaking, the chamberlains arrived, to hasten Haman to the banquet which Esther had prepared.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
