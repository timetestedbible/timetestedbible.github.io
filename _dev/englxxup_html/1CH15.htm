for the Lord has chosen them to bear the ark of the Lord, and to minister to him forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the Lord to the place which he <span class='add'>had</span> prepared for it.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David gathered together the sons of Aaron the Levites.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Of the sons of Kohath; <span class='add'>there was</span> Uriel the chief, and his brethren, a hundred and twenty.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren, two hundred and twenty.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Of the sons of Gershom;

Asaph the son of Berechiah <span class='add'>was one</span> of his brethren; and Ethan the son of Kushaiah was of the sons of Merari their brethren;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and with them their brethren of the second rank, Zechariah, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Elioel, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, the porters.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, with brazen cymbals to make <span class='add'>a sound</span> to be heard.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Zechariah, and Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, Benaiah, with lutes, on Alamoth.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps of Sheminith, to make a loud noise.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Chenaniah chief of the Levites <span class='add'>was</span> master of the bands, because he was skillful.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Berechiah and Elkanah <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers of the ark.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were sounding with trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah <span class='add'>were</span> doorkeepers of the ark of God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains of thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant from the house of Obed-edom with gladness.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it came to pass when God strengthened the Levites bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, that they sacrificed seven calves and seven rams.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And David <span class='add'>was</span> girded with a fine linen robe, and all the Levites <span class='add'>who were</span> bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the band of singers; also upon David <span class='add'>there was</span> a robe of fine linen.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a horn, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, playing loudly on lutes and harps.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the ark of the covenant of the Lord arrived, and came to the city of David; and Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window, and saw King David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
