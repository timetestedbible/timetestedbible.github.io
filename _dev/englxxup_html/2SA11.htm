<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 11</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the time of the year for kings going out <span class='add'>to battle</span> had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah: but David remained at Jerusalem.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king’s house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And David sent and inquired about the woman: and <span class='add'>one</span> said, <span class='add'>Is</span> not this Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite; and Joab sent Uriah to David.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Uriah arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David said to Uriah, Go to thy house, and wash thy feet: and Uriah departed from the house of the king, and a portion <span class='add'>of meat</span> from the king followed him.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Uriah slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And they brought David word, saying, Uriah has not gone down to his house. And David said to Uriah, Art thou not come from a journey? why hast thou not gone down to thy house?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how <span class='add'>should I do this? as</span> thy soul lives, I will not do this thing.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And David said to Uriah, Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee go. So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Uriah in front of the severe <span class='add'>part</span> of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Uriah in a place where he knew that valiant men were.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite died also.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, so as to tell them to the king.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to thee, Why did ye draw nigh to the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from off the wall?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thebez? why did ye draw near to the wall? then thou shalt say, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did ye draw nigh to the wall to fight? knew ye not that ye would be wounded from off the wall? Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thebez? why did ye draw near to the wall?   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the archers shot at thy servants from off the wall, and some of the king’s servants died, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in thine eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen thine array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
