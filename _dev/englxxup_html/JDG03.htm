  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they waited till they were ashamed, and, behold, there was no one that opened the doors of the upper chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead upon the earth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Ehud escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him; and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Ehud came into the land of Israel, that he blew the horn in Mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he <span class='add'>was</span> before them.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said to them, Come down after me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not suffer a man to pass over.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they smote Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every lusty <span class='add'>person</span> and every mighty man; and not a man escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So Moab was humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years; and Ehud judged them till he died.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And after him rose up Shamgar the son of Anath, and smote the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a plowshare <span class='add'>such as is drawn by</span> oxen; and he too delivered Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
