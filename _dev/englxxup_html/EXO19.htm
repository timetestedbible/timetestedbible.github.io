I come to thee in a pillar of a cloud, that the people may hear me speaking to thee, and may believe thee forever: and Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Go down and solemnly charge the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And let them be ready against the third day, for on the third day the Lord will descend upon Mount Sinai before all the people.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt separate the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mountain, nor touch any part of it: everyone that touches the mountain shall surely die.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>A hand shall not touch it, for <span class='add'>everyone that touches</span> shall be stoned with stones or shot through with a dart, whether beast or whether man, it shall not live: when the voices and trumpets and cloud depart from off the mountain, they shall come up on the mountain.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified them, and they washed their clothes.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to the people, Be ready: for three days come not near to a woman.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day, as the morning drew nigh, there were voices and lightnings and a dark cloud on Mount Sinai: the voice of the trumpet sounded loud, and all the people in the camp trembled.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Moses led the people forth out of the camp to meet God, and they stood by under the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The mount of Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because God had descended upon it in fire; and the smoke went up as the smoke of a furnace, and the people were exceedingly amazed.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the sounds of the trumpet were waxing very much louder. Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai on the top of the mountain; and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And God spoke to Moses, saying, Go down, and solemnly charge the people, lest at any time they draw nigh to God to gaze, and a multitude of them fall.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And let the priests that draw nigh to the Lord God sanctify themselves, lest he destroy some of them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses said to God, The people will not be able to approach to the mount of Sinai, for thou hast solemnly charged us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain and sanctify it.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord said to him, Go, descend, and come up thou and Aaron with thee; but let not the priests and the people force their way to come up to God, lest the Lord destroy some of them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
