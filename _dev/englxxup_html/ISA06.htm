And I said, Behold, I am <span class='add'>here</span>, send me. And he said, Go, and say to this people,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Ye shall hear indeed, but ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until the cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left desolate.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And after this God shall remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be multiplied.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And yet there shall be a tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
