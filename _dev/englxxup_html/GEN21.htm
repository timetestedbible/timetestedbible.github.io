for I have born a child in my old age.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast the day that his son Isaac was weaned.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Sarah having seen the son of Hagar the Egyptian who was born to Abraham, sporting with Isaac her son,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>then she said to Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son, for the son of this bondwoman shall not inherit with my son Isaac.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the word appeared very hard before Abraham concerning his son.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But God said to Abraham, Let it not be hard before thee concerning the child, and concerning the bondwoman; in all things whatsoever Sarah shall say to thee, hear her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And moreover I will make the son of this bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Abraham rose up in the morning and took loaves and a skin of water, and gave <span class='add'>them</span> to Hagar, and he put the child on her shoulder, and sent her away, and she having departed wandered in the wilderness near the well of the oath.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the water failed out of the skin, and she cast the child under a fir tree.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And she departed and sat down opposite him at a distance, as it were a bowshot, for she said, Surely I cannot see the death of my child: and she sat opposite him, and the child cried aloud and wept.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God heard the voice of the child from the place where he was, and an angel of God called Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What is it, Hagar? fear not, for God has heard the voice of the child from the place where he is.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Rise up, and take the child, and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him a great nation.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of springing water; and she went and filled the skin with water, and gave the child drink.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And God was with the child, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he dwelt in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of Paran of Egypt.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech spoke, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the chief captain of his host, to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all things, whatsoever thou mayest do.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now therefore swear to me by God that thou wilt not injure me, nor my seed, nor my name, but according to the righteousness which I have performed with thee thou shalt deal with me, and with the land in which thou hast sojourned.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Abraham said, I will swear.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the wells of water, which the servants of Abimelech took away.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to him, I know not who has done this thing to thee, neither didst thou tell it me, neither heard I it but only today.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraham took sheep and calves, and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs by themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set alone?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Abraham said, Thou shalt receive the seven ewe lambs of me, that they may be for me as a witness, that I dug this well.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore he named the name of that place, The Well of the Oath, for there they both swore.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they made a covenant at the well of the oath. And there rose up Abimelech, Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the commander-in-chief of his army, and they returned to the land of the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Abraham planted a field at the well of the oath, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
