And they went out both into the field.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, The Lord God of Israel knows that I will sound my father as I have an opportunity, three several times, and, behold, <span class='add'>if good</span> should be determined concerning David, and I do not send to thee to the field,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>God do so to Jonathan and more also: as I shall <span class='add'>also</span> report the evil to thee, and make it known to thee, and I will let thee go; and thou shalt depart in peace, and the Lord shall be with thee, as he was with my father.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if indeed I continue to live, then shalt thou deal mercifully with me; and if I indeed die,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>thou shalt not withdraw thy mercy from my house forever: and if thou doest not, when the Lord cuts off the enemies of David each from the face of the earth,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>should it happen</span> that the name of Jonathan be discovered by the house of David, then let the Lord seek out the enemies of David.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jonathan swore yet again to David, because he loved the soul of him that loved him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Jonathan said, Tomorrow <span class='add'>is</span> the new moon, and thou wilt be inquired for, because thy seat will be observed as vacant.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt stay three days, and watch an opportunity, and shalt come to thy place where thou mayest hide thyself in the day of thy business, and thou shalt wait by that ergab.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And I will shoot three arrows, aiming them at a mark.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> send a lad, saying, Go find me the arrow.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If I should expressly say to the lad, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> here, and on this side of thee, take it; <span class='add'>then</span> come, for it is well with thee, and there is no reason <span class='add'>for fear, as</span> the Lord lives: <span class='add'>but</span> if I should say thus to the young man, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> on that side of thee, and beyond; go, for the Lord hath sent thee away.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And as for the word which thou and I have spoken, behold, the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> witness between me and thee forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So David hides himself in the field, and the <span class='add'>new</span> month arrives, and the king comes to the table to eat.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he sat upon his seat as in former times, even on his seat by the wall, and he went before Jonathan; and Abner sat on one side of Saul, and the place of David was empty.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Saul said nothing on that day, for he said, It seems to have fallen out that he is not clean, because he has not purified himself.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow, on the second day of the month, that the place of David was empty; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why has not the son of Jesse attended both yesterday and today at the table?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, and said to him, David asked leave of me to go as far as Bethlehem his city;   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for we have a family sacrifice in the city, and my brethren have sent for me; and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, I will even go over and see my brethren: therefore he is not present at the table of the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Saul was exceedingly angry with Jonathan, and said to him, Thou son of traitorous damsels! for do I not know that thou art an accomplice with the son of Jesse to thy shame, and to the shame of thy mother’s nakedness?   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For so long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, thy kingdom shall not be established: now then send and take the young man, for he shall surely die.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Jonathan answered Saul, Why is he to die? what has he done?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Saul lifted up his spear against Jonathan to slay him: so Jonathan knew that this evil was determined on by his father to slay David.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Jonathan sprang up from the table in great anger, and did not eat bread on the second <span class='add'>day</span> of the month, for he grieved bitterly for David, because his father determined <span class='add'>on mischief</span> against him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And morning came, and Jonathan went out to the field, as he appointed <span class='add'>to do</span> for a signal to David, and a little boy <span class='add'>was</span> with him.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said to the boy, Run, find me the arrows which I shoot: and the boy ran, and <span class='add'>Jonathan</span> shot an arrow, and sent it beyond <span class='add'>him</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the boy came to the place where the arrow was which Jonathan shot; and Jonathan cried out after the lad, and said, The arrow <span class='add'>is</span> on that side of thee and beyond thee.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Jonathan cried out after his boy, saying, Make all speed, and stay not. And Jonathan’s boy gathered up the arrows, and brought the arrows to his master.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And the boy knew nothing, only Jonathan and David <span class='add'>knew</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to his boy, Go, enter into the city.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And when the lad went in, then David arose from the ergab, and fell upon his face, and did obeisance to him three times, and they kissed each other, and wept for each other, for a great while.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, and as we have both sworn in the name of the Lord, saying, The Lord shall be witness between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed forever—<span class='add'>even so let it be</span>.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
