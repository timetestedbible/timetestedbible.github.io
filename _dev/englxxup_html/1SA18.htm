Now the hand of the Philistines was against Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul charged his servants, saying, Speak ye privately to David, saying, Behold, the king delights in thee, and all his servants love thee, and do thou become the king’s son-in-law.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the servants of Saul spoke these words in the ears of David; and David said, <span class='add'>Is it</span> a light thing in your eyes to become son-in-law to the king? whereas I <span class='add'>am</span> a humble man, and not honorable?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the servants of Saul reported to him according to these words, which David spoke.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Saul said, Thus shall ye speak to David, The king wants no gift but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to avenge himself on the king’s enemies. Now Saul thought to cast him into the hands of the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the servants of Saul report these words to David, and David was well pleased to become the son-in-law to the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And David arose, and went, he and his men, and smote among the Philistines a hundred men: and he brought their foreskins, and he becomes the king’s son-in-law, and <span class='add'>Saul</span> gives him Michal his daughter to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Saul saw that the Lord <span class='add'>was</span> with David, and <span class='add'>that</span> all Israel loved him.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he was yet more afraid of David.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
