Separate thyself from me; if thou <span class='add'>goest</span> to the left, I will go to the right, and if thou goest to the right, I will go to the left.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Lot having lifted up his eyes, observed all the country round about Jordan, that it was all watered, before God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, as the garden of the Lord, and as the land of Egypt, until thou come to Zoar.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Lot chose for himself all the country round Jordan, and Lot went from the east, and they were separated each from his brother. And Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Lot dwelt in a city of the neighboring people, and pitched his tent in Sodom.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the men of Sodom were evil, and exceedingly sinful before God.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And God said to Abram after Lot was separated from him, Look up with thine eyes, and behold from the place where thou now art northward and southward, and eastward and seaward;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>for all the land which thou seest, I will give it to thee and to thy seed forever.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And I will make thy seed like the dust of the earth; if anyone is able to number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed be numbered.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Arise and traverse the land, both in the length of it and in the breadth; for to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Abram having removed his tent, came and dwelt by the oak of Mamre, which was in Hebron, and he there built an altar to the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
