Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheepcote, that thou shouldest be a prince over my people, over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I was with thee wheresoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies before thee, and I made thee renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he <span class='add'>has done</span> from the beginning,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell thee that thou shalt build a house to him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass when thy days shall have been fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even forever.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom forever before me, and his throne shall be set up forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And King David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what <span class='add'>is</span> my house, that thou hast loved me hitherto?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Whereas I was very little before thee, O Lord, my Lord, yet thou spokest concerning the house of thy servant for a long time <span class='add'>to come</span>. And <span class='add'>is</span> this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And what shall David yet say to thee? and now thou knowest thy servant, O Lord, my Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou hast wrought for thy servant’s sake, and according to thy heart thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make it known to thy servant,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>that he may magnify thee, O my Lord; for there is no one like thee, and there is no God but thou among all of whom we have heard with our ears.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And what other nation in the earth <span class='add'>is</span> as thy people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make thee a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that thou shouldest cast out nations and <span class='add'>their</span> tabernacles from the presence of thy people, whom thou didst redeem for thyself out of Egypt?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And thou hast prepared for thyself thy people Israel to be a people forever, and thou, Lord, art become their God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word forever which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house: and now as thou hast said,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Let thy name be magnified forever.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Almighty Lord God of Israel, thou hast uncovered the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore thy servant has found <span class='add'>in</span> his heart to pray this prayer to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And now, O Lord my Lord, thou art God; and thy words will be true, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And now begin and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee; for thou, O Lord, my Lord, hast spoken, and the house of thy servant shall be blessed with thy blessing so as to continue forever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
