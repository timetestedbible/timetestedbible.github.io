And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what commandest thou thy servant?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the captain of the Lord’s host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe off thy feet, for the place whereon thou now standest is holy.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
