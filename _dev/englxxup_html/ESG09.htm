What then dost thou yet ask, that it may be <span class='add'>done</span> for thee?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Esther said to the king, Let it be granted to the Jews so to treat them tomorrow as to hang the ten sons of Haman.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he permitted it to be so done; and he gave up to the Jews of the city the bodies of the sons of Haman to hang.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Jews assembled in Susa on the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of Adar, and slew three hundred men, but plundered no property.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the rest of the Jews who were in the kingdom assembled, and helped one another, and obtained rest from their enemies: for they destroyed fifteen thousand of them on the thirteenth <span class='add'>day</span> of Adar, but took no spoil.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they rested on the fourteenth of the same month, and kept it as a day of rest with joy and gladness.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Jews in the city Susa assembled also on the fourteenth <span class='add'>day</span> and rested; and they kept also the fifteenth with joy and gladness.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>On this account then <span class='add'>it is that</span> the Jews dispersed in every foreign land keep the fourteenth of Adar <span class='add'>as</span> a holy day with joy, sending portions each to his neighbor.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Mordecai wrote these things in a book, and sent them to the Jews, as many as were in the kingdom of Artaxerxes, both them that were near and them that were afar off,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>to establish these <span class='add'>as</span> joyful days, and to keep the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>for on these days the Jews obtained rest from their enemies: and <span class='add'>as to</span> the month, which was Adar, in which a change was made for them, from mourning to joy, and from sorrow to a good day, to spend the whole of it <span class='add'>in</span> good days of feasting and gladness, sending portions to their friends, and to the poor.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Jews consented <span class='add'>to this</span> accordingly as Mordecai wrote to them,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span><span class='add'>showing</span> how Haman the son of Hammedatha the Macedonian fought against them, how he made a decree and cast lots to destroy them utterly;   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>also how he went in to the king, telling <span class='add'>him</span> to hang Mordecai: but all the calamities he tried to bring upon the Jews came upon himself, and he was hanged, and his children.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Therefore these days were called Purim, because of the lots (for in their language they are called Pur); because of the words of this letter, and <span class='add'>because of</span> all they suffered on this account, and all that happened to them.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Mordecai</span> established it, and the Jews took upon themselves, and upon their seed, and upon those that were joined to them <span class='add'>to observe it</span>, neither would they on any account behave differently: but these days <span class='add'>were to be</span> a memorial kept in every generation, and city, and family, and province.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And these days of the Purim, <span class='add'>said they</span>, shall be kept forever, and their memorial shall not fail in any generation.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And queen Esther, the daughter of Amminadab, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote all that they had done, and the confirmation of the letter of Purim.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Mordecai and Esther the queen appointed <span class='add'>a fast</span> for themselves privately, even at that time also having formed their plan against their own health.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Esther established it by a command forever, and it was written for a memorial.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
