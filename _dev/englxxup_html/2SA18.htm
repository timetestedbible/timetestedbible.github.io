<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And David numbered the people with him, and set over them captains of thousands and captains of hundreds.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And David sent away the people, the third part under the hand of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, and the third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And David said to the people, I also will surely go out with you.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said, Thou shalt not go out: for if we should indeed flee, they will not care for us; and if half of us should die, they will not mind us; for thou <span class='add'>art</span> as ten thousand of us: and now <span class='add'>it is</span> well that thou shalt be to us an aid to help us in the city.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the king said to them, Whatsoever shall seem good in your eyes I will do. And the king stood by the side of the gate, and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Spare for my sake the young man Absalom. And all the people heard the king charging all the commanders concerning Absalom.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all the people went out into the wood against Israel; and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the people of Israel fell down there before the servants of David, and there was a great slaughter in that day, <span class='add'>even</span> twenty thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the land: and the wood consumed more of the people than the sword consumed among the people in that day.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Absalom went to meet the servants of David: and Absalom was mounted on his mule, and the mule came under the thick boughs of a great oak; and his head was entangled in the oak, and he was suspended between heaven and earth; and the mule passed on from under him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And a man saw it, and reported to Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Joab said to the man who reported it to him, And, behold, thou didst see him: why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver, and a girdle.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the man said to Joab, Were I even to receive a thousand shekels of silver, I would not lift my hand against the king’s son; for in our ears the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Take care of the young man Absalom for me,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>so as to do no harm to his life: and nothing of the matter will be concealed from the king, and thou wilt set thyself against me.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Joab said, I will begin this; I will not thus remain with thee. And Joab took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom, while he was yet alive in the heart of the oak.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And ten young men that bore Joab’s armor compassed Absalom, and smote him and slew him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab spared the people.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he took Absalom, and cast him into a great cavern in the wood, into a deep pit, and set up over him a very great heap of stones: and all Israel fled every man to his tent.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Now Absalom while yet alive had taken and set up for himself the pillar near which he was taken, and set it up so as to have the pillar in the king’s dale; for he said he had no son to keep his name in remembrance: and he called the pillar, Absalom’s hand, until this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said, Let me run now and carry glad tidings to the king, for the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Joab said to him, Thou <span class='add'>shalt</span> not <span class='add'>be</span> a messenger of glad tidings this day; thou shalt bear them another day; but on this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king’s son is dead.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joab said to Hushai, Go, report to the king all that thou hast seen. And Hushai did obeisance to Joab, and went out.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, Nay, let me also run after Hushai. And Joab said, Why wouldest thou thus run, my son? attend, thou hast no tidings for profit if thou go.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said, Why should I not run? and Joab said to him, Run. And Ahimaaz ran along the way of Kechar, and outran Hushai.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And David was sitting between the two gates: and the watchman went up on the top of the gate of the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone before him.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the watchman cried out, and reported to the king. And the king said, If he be alone, <span class='add'>there are</span> good tidings in his mouth. And the man came and drew near.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman cried at the gate, and said, And look, another man running alone. And the king said, He also brings glad tidings.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the watchman said, I see the running of the first as the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He <span class='add'>is</span> a good man, and will come to <span class='add'>report</span> glad tidings.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Ahimaaz cried out and said to the king, Peace. And he did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground, and said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the Lord thy God, who has delivered up the men that lifted up their hands against my lord the king.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the king said, <span class='add'>Is</span> the young man Absalom safe? and Ahimaaz said, I saw a great multitude <span class='add'>at the time</span> of Joab’s sending the king’s servant and thy servant, and I knew not what was there.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the king said, Turn aside, stand still here. And he turned aside, and stood.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And, behold, Hushai came up, and said to the king, Let my lord the king hear glad tidings, for the Lord has avenged thee this day upon all them that rose up against thee.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the king said to Hushai, Is it well with the young man Absalom? and Hushai said, Let the enemies of my lord the king, and all whosoever have risen up against him for evil, be as that young man.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
