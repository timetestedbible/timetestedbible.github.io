If it seem good to thee to go with me to Babylon, then will I set mine eyes upon thee.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>But if not, depart; return to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Judah, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Judah: to whatsoever places it seems good in thine eyes to go, do thou even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, and dwelt in the midst of his people that was left in the land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And all the leaders of the host that was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah <span class='add'>governor</span> in the land, and they committed to him the men and their wives, whom <span class='add'>Nebuchadnezzar had</span> not removed to Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And, behold, I dwell in your presence at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do ye gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put <span class='add'>them</span> into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which ye have obtained possession of.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and those <span class='add'>that were</span> in Edom, and those <span class='add'>that were</span> in all <span class='add'>the rest of</span> the country, heard that the king of Babylon <span class='add'>had</span> granted a remnant to Judah, and that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they came to Gedaliah into the land of Judah, to Mizpah, and gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and said to him, Dost thou indeed know that King Baalis son of Ammon has sent Ishmael to thee to slay thee? But Gedaliah believed them not.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Johanan said to Gedaliah secretly in Mizpah, I will go now and smite Ishmael, and let no man know <span class='add'>it</span>; lest he slay thee, and all the Jews that are gathered to thee be dispersed, and the remnant of Judah perish.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But Gedaliah said to Johanan, Do not the thing, for thou speakest lies concerning Ishmael.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
