 </div><div class='q'>Even Moses, beloved of God and men,  </div><div class='q'>Whose memorial is blessed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He made him like to the glorious saints,  </div><div class='q'>And magnified him, so that his enemies stood in fear of him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>By his words he caused the wonders to cease,  </div><div class='q'>And he made him glorious in the sight of kings,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him a commandment for his people,  </div><div class='q'>And showed him part of his glory.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>He sanctified him <span class='add'>in</span> his faithfulness and meekness,  </div><div class='q'>And chose him out of all men.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>He made him to hear his voice,  </div><div class='q'>And brought him into the dark cloud,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him commandments before his face,  </div><div class='q'>Even the law of life and knowledge,  </div><div class='q'>That he might teach Jacob his covenants,  </div><div class='q'>And Israel his judgments.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He exalted Aaron, a holy man like unto him,  </div><div class='q'>Even his brother, of the tribe of Levi.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>An everlasting covenant he made with him,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him the priesthood among the people;  </div><div class='q'>He beautified him with comely ornaments,  </div><div class='q'>And clothed him with a robe of glory.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He put upon him perfect glory;  </div><div class='q'>And strengthened him with rich garments,  </div><div class='q'>With breeches, with a long robe, and the ephod.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he compassed him with pomegranates  </div><div class='q'>And with many golden bells round about,  </div><div class='q'>That as he went there might be a sound,  </div><div class='q'>And a noise made that might be heard in the temple  </div><div class='q'>For a memorial to the children of his people;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>With a holy garment, with gold, and blue silk,  </div><div class='q'>And purple, the work of the embroiderer,  </div><div class='q'>With a breastplate of judgment, with the revealers of truth;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>With twisted scarlet, the work of the cunning workman,  </div><div class='q'>With precious stones graven like seals,  </div><div class='q'>And set in gold, the work of the jeweler,  </div><div class='q'>With a writing engraved for a memorial,  </div><div class='q'>After the number of the tribes of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>He set a crown of gold upon the miter,  </div><div class='q'>Wherein was engraven Holiness,  </div><div class='q'>An ornament of honor, a costly work,  </div><div class='q'>The desires of the eyes, goodly and beautiful.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Before him there were none such,  </div><div class='q'>Neither did ever any stranger put them on,  </div><div class='q'>But only his children  </div><div class='q'>And his children’s children perpetually.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Their sacrifices shall be wholly consumed every day twice continually.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;

</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He chose him out of all men living  </div><div class='q'>To offer sacrifices to the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>Incense, and a sweet savor, for a memorial,  </div><div class='q'>To make reconciliation for his people.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>He gave unto him his commandments,  </div><div class='q'>And authority in the statutes of judgments,  </div><div class='q'>That he should teach Jacob the testimonies,  </div><div class='q'>And inform Israel in his laws.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Strangers conspired together against him,  </div><div class='q'>And maligned him in the wilderness,  </div><div class='q'>Even the men that were of Dathan’s and Abiram’s side,  </div><div class='q'>And the congregation of Korah, with fury and wrath.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>This the Lord saw, and it displeased him,  </div><div class='q'>And in his wrathful indignation were they consumed:  </div><div class='q'>He did wonders upon them, to consume them with the fiery flame.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But he made Aaron more honorable,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him a heritage,  </div><div class='q'>And divided unto him the firstfruits of the increase;  </div><div class='q'>Especially he prepared bread in abundance:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For they eat of the sacrifices of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>Which he gave unto him and his seed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Howbeit in the land of the people he had no inheritance,  </div><div class='q'>Neither had he any portion among the people:  </div><div class='q'>For the Lord himself is his portion and inheritance.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>The third in glory is Phinehas the son of Eleazar,  </div><div class='q'>Because he had zeal in the fear of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And stood up with good courage of heart when the people were turned back,  </div><div class='q'>And made reconciliation for Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Therefore was there a covenant of peace made with him,  </div><div class='q'>That he should be the chief of the sanctuary and of his people,  </div><div class='q'>And that he and his posterity should have the dignity of the priesthood forever:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>According to the covenant made with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah,  </div><div class='q'>That the inheritance of the king should be to his posterity alone:  </div><div class='q'>So the inheritance of Aaron should also be unto his seed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>God give you wisdom in your heart  </div><div class='q'>To judge his people in righteousness,  </div><div class='q'>That their good things be not abolished,  </div><div class='q'>And that their glory may endure forever.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
