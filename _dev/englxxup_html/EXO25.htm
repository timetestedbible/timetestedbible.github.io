and ye shall take my firstfruits.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold and silver and brass,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and blue, and purple, and double scarlet, and fine spun linen, and goats’ hair,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and rams’ skins dyed red, and blue skins, and incorruptible wood,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and oil for the light, incense for anointing oil, and for the composition of incense,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>and sardius stones, and stones for the carved work of the breastplate, and the full-length robe.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And thou shalt make me a sanctuary, and I will appear among you.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou shalt make for me according to all things which I show thee in the mountain; even the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all its furniture: so shalt thou make it.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the ark of testimony of incorruptible wood; the length of two cubits and a half, and the breadth of a cubit and a half, and the height of a cubit and a half.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And thou shalt gild it with pure gold, thou shalt gild it within and without; and thou shalt make for it golden wreaths twisted round about.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt cast for it four golden rings, and shalt put them on the four sides; two rings on the one side, and two rings on the other side.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt make staffs <span class='add'>of</span> incorruptible wood, and shalt gild them with gold.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thou shalt put the staffs into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark with them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The staffs shall remain fixed in the rings of the ark.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thou shalt put into the ark the testimonies which I shall give thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And thou shalt make a propitiatory, a lid of pure gold;
