Now he had mounted his ass, and his two servants were with him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when the ass saw the angel of God standing opposite in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, then the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field; and <span class='add'>Balaam</span> smote the ass with his staff to direct her in the way.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord stood in the avenues of the vines, a fence <span class='add'>being</span> on this side and a fence on that.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And when the ass saw the angel of God, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall, and he smote her again.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord went farther, and came and stood in a narrow place where it was impossible to turn to the right or the left.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And when the ass saw the angel of God, she lay down under Balaam; and Balaam was angry, and struck the ass with his staff.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And God opened the mouth of the ass, and she says to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me this third time?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me; and if I <span class='add'>had</span> had a sword in my hand, I would now have killed thee.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the ass says to Balaam, <span class='add'>Am</span> not I thine ass on which thou hast ridden since thy youth till this day? did I ever do thus to thee, utterly disregarding <span class='add'>thee</span>? and he said, No.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And God opened the eyes of Balaam, and he sees the angel of the Lord withstanding <span class='add'>him</span> in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand, and he stooped down and worshiped on his face.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the angel of God said to him, Why hast thou smitten thine ass this third time? and, behold, I came out to withstand thee, for thy way was not seemly before me; and when the ass saw me, she turned away from me this third time.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And if she had not turned out of the way, surely now, I should have slain thee, and should have saved her alive.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have sinned, for I did not know that thou wert standing opposite in the way to meet <span class='add'>me</span>; and now if it shall not be pleasing to thee <span class='add'>for me to go on</span>, I will return.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men: nevertheless the word which I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt take heed to speak. And Balaam went with the princes of Balak.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him, to a city of Moab, which is on the borders of Arnon, which is on the <span class='add'>extreme</span> part of the borders.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send to thee to call thee? why hast thou not come to me? shall I not indeed be able to honor thee?   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I am now come to thee: shall I be able to say anything? the word which God shall put into my mouth, that I shall speak.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to the cities of streets.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Balak offered sheep and calves, and sent to Balaam and to his princes who were with him.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And it was morning; and Balak took Balaam, and brought him up to the pillar of Baal, and showed him thence a part of the people.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
