he shall not pour oil upon it, nor shall he put frankincense upon it, because it is a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he shall bring it to the priest; and the priest having taken a handful of it, shall lay the memorial of it on the altar of whole burnt offerings to the Lord; it is a sin offering.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, which he has sinned in one of these things, and it shall be forgiven him; and that which is left shall be the priest’s, as an offering of fine flour.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The soul which shall be really unconscious, and shall sin unwillingly in any of the holy things of the Lord, shall even bring to the Lord for his transgression, a ram of the flock without blemish, valued according to shekels of silver according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for his <span class='add'>transgression</span> wherein he transgressed.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he shall make compensation for that wherein he has sinned in the holy things;
