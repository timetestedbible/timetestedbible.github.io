Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let all men speak, and let all praise him for <span class='add'>his</span> righteousness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children’s works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Give praise to the Lord, <span class='add'>for he is</span> good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be built in thee again with joy, and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives, and love in thee forever those that are miserable.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise thee with great joy.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Cursed <span class='add'>are</span> all they which hate thee, and blessed shall all be which love thee forever.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>O blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they which love thee, <span class='add'>for</span> they shall rejoice in thy peace: blessed <span class='add'>are</span> they which have been sorrowful for all thy scourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they have seen all thy glory, and shall be glad forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Let my soul bless God the great King.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphire, and emerald, and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stone of Ophir.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled <span class='add'>it</span> forever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
