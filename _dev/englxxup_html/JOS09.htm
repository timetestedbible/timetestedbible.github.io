  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said to Joshua, We are thy servants: and Joshua said to them, Whence are ye, and whence have ye come?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And they said, Thy servants are come from a very far country in the name of the Lord thy God: for we have heard his name, and all that he did in Egypt,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and all that he did to the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth and in Edrei.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And our elders and all that inhabit our land when they heard spoke to us, saying, Take to yourselves provision for the way, and go to meet them; and ye shall say to them, We are thy servants, and now make a covenant with us.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>These <span class='add'>are</span> the loaves—we took them hot for our journey on the day on which we came out to come to you; and now they are dried and become moldy.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the skins of wine which we filled when new, and they are rent; and our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the chiefs took of their provision, and asked not <span class='add'>counsel of</span> the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Joshua made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them to preserve them; and the princes of the congregation swore to them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were near neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel departed and came to their cities; and their cities <span class='add'>were</span> Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and the cities of Jearim.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the children of Israel fought not with them, because all the princes swore to them by the Lord God of Israel; and all the congregation murmured at the princes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the princes said to all the congregation: We have sworn to them by the Lord God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>This we will do; take them alive, and we will preserve them: so there shall not be wrath against us by reason of the oath which we swore to them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They shall live, and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation, as the princes said to them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua called them together and said to them, Why have ye deceived me, saying, We live very far from you; whereas ye are fellow countrymen of those who dwell among us?
