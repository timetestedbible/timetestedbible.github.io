For he said, I will propitiate his countenance with the gifts going before his presence, and afterward I will behold his face, for peradventure he will accept me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So the presents went on before him, but he himself lodged that night in the camp.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he rose up in that night, and took his two wives and his two maidservants, and his eleven children, and crossed over the ford of Jabbok.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he took them, and passed over the torrent, and brought over all his possessions.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him till the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he saw that he prevailed not against him; and he touched the broad part of his thigh, and the broad part of Jacob’s thigh was benumbed in his wrestling with him.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said to him, Let me go, for the day has dawned; but he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he said to him, What is thy name? and he answered, Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he said to him, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; for thou hast prevailed with God, and shalt be mighty with men.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob asked and said, Tell me thy name; and he said, Wherefore dost thou ask after my name? and he blessed him there.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Jacob called the name of that place, the Face of God; For, <span class='add'>said he</span>, I have seen God face to face, and my life was preserved.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the sun rose upon him, when he passed the Face of God; and he halted upon his thigh.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Therefore the children of Israel will by no means eat of the sinew which was benumbed, which is on the broad part of the thigh, until this day, because <span class='add'>the angel</span> touched the broad part of the thigh of Jacob—<span class='add'>even</span> the sinew which was benumbed.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
