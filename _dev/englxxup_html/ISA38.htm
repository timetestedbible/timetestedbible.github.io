And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give orders concerning thy house: for thou shalt die, and not live.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Isaiah, saying, Go, and say to Hezekiah,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> add to thy time fifteen years.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to thee from the Lord, that God will do this thing;   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees <span class='add'>of the dial</span> by which ten degrees on the house of thy father the sun has gone down—I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten degrees by which the shadow had gone down.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The prayer of Hezekiah king of Judea, when he had been sick, and was recovered from his sickness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span><span class='add'>My life</span> has failed from among my kindred: I have parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me, as one that having pitched a tent takes it down <span class='add'>again</span>: my breath was with me as a weaver’s web, when she that weaves draws nigh to cut off <span class='add'>the</span> thread.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day <span class='add'>even</span> to night.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for mine eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and removed the sorrow of my soul.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>Yea</span>, O Lord, for it was told thee concerning this; and thou hast revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all <span class='add'>my</span> sins behind me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For they that are in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The living shall bless thee, as I also <span class='add'>do</span>: for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare thy righteousness,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Now Isaiah had said to Hezekiah; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and thou shalt be well.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Hezekiah said, This is a sign to Hezekiah, that I shall go up to the house of God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
