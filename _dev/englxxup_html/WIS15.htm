  </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it,  </div><div class='q'>And so they desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Both they that make them, they that desire them, and they that worship them,  </div><div class='q'>Are lovers of evil things, and are worthy to have such things to trust upon.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the potter, tempering soft earth,  </div><div class='q'>Fashioneth every vessel with much labor for our service:  </div><div class='q'>Yea, of the same clay he maketh  </div><div class='q'>Both the vessels that serve for clean uses,  </div><div class='q'>And likewise also all such as serve to the contrary:  </div><div class='q'>But what is the use of either sort, the potter himself is the judge.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And employing his labors lewdly, he maketh a vain god of the same clay,  </div><div class='q'>Even he which a little before was made of earth himself,  </div><div class='q'>And within a little while after returneth to the same, out of the which he was taken,  </div><div class='q'>When his life which was lent him shall be demanded.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have much labor,  </div><div class='q'>Nor that his life is short:  </div><div class='q'>But striveth to excel goldsmiths and silversmiths,  </div><div class='q'>And endeavoreth to do like the workers in brass,  </div><div class='q'>And counteth it his glory to make counterfeit things.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth,  </div><div class='q'>And his life of less value than clay:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker,  </div><div class='q'>And him that inspired into him an active soul,  </div><div class='q'>And breathed in a living spirit.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But they counted our life a pastime,  </div><div class='q'>And our time here a market for gain:  </div><div class='q'>For, say they, we must be getting every way, though it be by evil means.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vessels and graven images,  </div><div class='q'>Knoweth himself to offend above all others.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection,  </div><div class='q'>Are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods:  </div><div class='q'>Which neither have the use of eyes to see,  </div><div class='q'>Nor noses to draw breath,  </div><div class='q'>Nor ears to hear,  </div><div class='q'>Nor fingers of hands to handle;  </div><div class='q'>And as for their feet, they are slow to go.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For man made them,  </div><div class='q'>And he that borrowed his own spirit fashioned them:  </div><div class='q'>But no man can make a god like unto himself.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands:  </div><div class='q'>For he himself is better than the things which he worshipeth:  </div><div class='q'>Whereas <span class='add'>he</span> lived once, but they never.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Yea, they worshiped those beasts also that are most hateful:  </div><div class='q'>For being compared together, some are worse than others.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired in respect of beasts:  </div><div class='q'>But they went without the praise of God and his blessing.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
