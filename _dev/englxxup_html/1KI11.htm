And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. And he took strange women, as well as the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabitish, Ammonitish women, Syrians and Edomites, Hittites, and Amorites;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>of the nations concerning whom the Lord forbade the children of Israel, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you, lest they turn away your hearts after their idols: Solomon clove to these in love.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the time of the old age of Solomon, that his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as <span class='add'>was</span> the heart of David his father. And the strange women turned away his heart after their gods.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Solomon built a high place to Chemosh the idol of Moab, and to their king the idol of the children of Ammon,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and to Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus he acted toward all his strange wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their idols.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord: he went not after the Lord, as David his father.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because he turned away his heart from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared twice to him,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>and charged him concerning this matter, by no means to go after other gods, but to take heed to do what the Lord God commanded him; neither was his heart perfect with the Lord, according to the heart of David his father.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Solomon, Because it has been thus with thee, and thou hast not kept my commandments and my ordinances which I commanded thee, I will surely rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and give it to thy servant.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Only in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s sake: <span class='add'>but</span> I will take it out of the hand of thy son.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Only I will not take away the whole kingdom: I will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord raised up an enemy to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite, and Rezon son of Eliada who <span class='add'>dwelt</span> in Raama, <span class='add'>and</span> Hadadezer king of Zobah his master (and men gathered to him, and he was head of the conspiracy, and he seized on Damascus), and they were adversaries to Israel all the days of Solomon: and Hadad the Edomite <span class='add'>was</span> of the seed royal in Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it happened, that while David was utterly destroying Edom, while Joab captain of the host was going to bury the dead, when they slew every male in Edom   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>(for Joab and all Israel abode there six months in Edom, until he utterly destroyed every male in Edom);   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>that Hadad ran away, he and all the Edomites of the servants of his father with him; and they went into Egypt; and Hadad <span class='add'>was then</span> a little child.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there rise up men out of the city of Midian, and they come to Paran, and take men with them, and come to Pharaoh king of Egypt: and Hadad went in to Pharaoh, and he gave him a house, and appointed him provision.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, and he gave him his wife’s sister in marriage, the elder sister of Tahpenes.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the sister of Tahpenes bore to him, <span class='add'>even</span> to Hadad, Genubath her son; and Tahpenes brought him up in the midst of the sons of Pharaoh, and Genubath was in the midst of the sons of Pharaoh.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead; and Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me go, and I will return to my country.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to Hadad, What lackest thou with me? that lo! thou seekest to depart to thy country? and Hadad said to him, By all means let me go. So Hadad returned to his country;   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>this <span class='add'>is</span> the mischief which Hadad did, and he was a bitter enemy of Israel, and he reigned in the land of Edom.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the Ephraimite of Zeredah, the son of a widow, <span class='add'>was</span> servant of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>was</span> the occasion of his lifting up <span class='add'>his</span> hands against King Solomon: now King Solomon built the citadel, he completed the fortification of the city of David his father.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the man Jeroboam was very strong; and Solomon saw the young man that he was active, and he set him over the levies of the house of Joseph.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it came to pass at that time, that Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite the prophet found him in the way, and caused him to turn aside out of the way: and Ahijah was clad with a new garment, and they two <span class='add'>were</span> alone in the field.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Ahijah laid hold of his new garment that was upon him, and tore it <span class='add'>into</span> twelve pieces:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>and he said to Jeroboam, Take to thyself ten pieces, for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Behold, I rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give thee ten tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>Yet he shall have two tribes, for my servant David’s sake, and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Because he forsook me, and sacrificed to Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, and to Chemosh, and to the idols of Moab, and to their king the abomination of the children of Ammon, and he walked not in my ways, to do that which was right before me, as David his father <span class='add'>did</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand (for I will certainly resist him all the days of his life), for David my servant’s sake, whom I have chosen.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But I will take the kingdom out of the hand of his son, and give thee ten tribes.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>But to his son I will give the two <span class='add'>remaining</span> tribes, that my servant David may have an establishment continually before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name there.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign as thy soul desires, and thou shalt be king over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt keep all the commandments that I shall give thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right before me, to keep my ordinances and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built to David.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Solomon sought to slay Jeroboam: but he arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and he was in Egypt until Solomon died.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And the rest of the history of Solomon, and all that he did, and all his wisdom, behold are not these things written in the book of the life of Solomon?   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the days <span class='add'>during</span> which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel <span class='add'>were</span> forty years.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David his father. And it came to pass when Jeroboam son of Nebat heard <span class='add'>of it</span>, even while he was yet in Egypt as he fled from the face of Solomon and dwelt in Egypt, he straightaway comes into his own city, into the land of Zeredah in the mount of Ephraim. And King Solomon slept with his fathers, and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
