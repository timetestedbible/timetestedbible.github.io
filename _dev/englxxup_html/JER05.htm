Thy sons have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they committed adultery, and lodged in harlots’ houses.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after his neighbor’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Go up upon her battlements, and break <span class='add'>them</span> down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses; for they are the Lord’s.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the house of Israel have indeed dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord: the house of Judah also   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>have lied to their Lord, and they have said, These things are not so; no evils shall come upon us; and we shall not see sword or famine.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Our prophets became wind, and the word of the Lord was not in them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I have made my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> bring upon you a nation from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; a nation the sound of whose language one shall not understand.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span><span class='add'>They are</span> all mighty men:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and they shall devour your harvest, and your bread; and shall devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig plantations, and your olive yards: and they shall utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein ye trusted, with the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I will not utterly destroy you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that thou shalt say to them, Because ye served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Proclaim these things to the house of Jacob, and let them be heard in the house of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Hear ye now these things, O foolish and senseless people; who have eyes, and see not; and have ears, and hear not:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>will ye not be afraid of me? saith the Lord; and will ye not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea, <span class='add'>as</span> a perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yea, it shall rage, but not prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But this people has a disobedient and rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and they have not said in their heart, Let us fear now the Lord our God, who gives us the early and latter rain, according to the season of the fulfillment of the ordinance of harvest, and has preserved <span class='add'>it</span> for us.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Your transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good things from you.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For among my people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have caught <span class='add'>them</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As a snare which has been set is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great, and become rich:   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>and they have transgressed <span class='add'>the rule of</span> judgment; they have not judged the cause of the orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Shocking and horrible deeds have been done on the land;   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>the prophets utter unrighteous prophecies, and the priests have clapped their hands: and my people has loved <span class='add'>to have it</span> thus: and what will ye do for the future?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
