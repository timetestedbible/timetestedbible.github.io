And Jacob was silent until they came.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Hamor the father of Shechem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the sons of Jacob came from the plain; and when they heard, the men were deeply pained, and it was very grievous to them, because <span class='add'>the man</span> wrought folly in Israel, having lain with the daughter of Jacob, and so it must not be.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Hamor spoke to them, saying, Shechem my son has chosen in his heart your daughter; give her therefore to him for a wife,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for your sons.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you, dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever ye shall name.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Multiply <span class='add'>your demand of</span> dowry very much, and I will give accordingly as ye shall say to me, only ye shall give me this damsel for a wife.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the sons of Jacob answered to Shechem and Hamor his father craftily, and spoke to them, because they had defiled Dinah their sister.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, said to them, We shall not be able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised, for it is a reproach to us.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Only on these terms will we conform to you, and dwell among you, if ye also will be as we are, in that every male of you be circumcised.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And we will give our daughters to you, and we will take of your daughters for wives to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will be as one race.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But if ye will not hearken to us to be circumcised, we will take our daughter and depart.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the words pleased Hamor, and Shechem the son of Hamor.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the young man delayed not to do this thing, for he was much attached to Jacob’s daughter, and he was the most honorable of all in his father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their city, and spoke to the men of their city, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>These men are peaceable, let them dwell with us upon the land, and let them trade in it, and behold the land is extensive before them; we will take their daughters to us for wives, and we will give them our daughters.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Only on these terms will the men conform to us to dwell with us so as to be one people, if every male of us be circumcised, as they also are circumcised.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And shall not their cattle and their herds, and their possessions, be ours? only in this let us conform to them, and they will dwell with us.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all that went in at the gate of their city hearkened to Hamor and Shechem his son, and they were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin every male.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city securely, and slew every male.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of the house of Shechem, and went forth.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But the sons of Jacob came upon the wounded, and ravaged the city wherein they had defiled Dinah their sister.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses they took, and all things whatsoever were in the city, and whatsoever were in the plain.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they took captive all the persons of them, and all their store, and their wives, and plundered both whatever things there were in the city, and whatever things there were in the houses.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have made me hateful so that I should be evil to all the inhabitants of the land, both among the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and I am few in number; they will gather themselves against me and cut me in pieces, and I shall be utterly destroyed, and my house.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they said, Nay, but shall they treat our sister as a harlot?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
