<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>My heart is established in the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>My horn is exalted in my God;  </div><div class='q'>My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,  </div><div class='q'>I have rejoiced in thy salvation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For there is none holy as the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And there is none righteous as our God:  </div><div class='q'>There is none holy beside thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Boast not, and utter not high things;  </div><div class='q'>Let not high-sounding words come out of your mouth,  </div><div class='q'>For the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> a God of knowledge,  </div><div class='q'>And God prepares his own designs.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The bow of the mighty has waxed feeble,  </div><div class='q'>And the weak have girded themselves with strength.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They that were full of bread are brought low;  </div><div class='q'>And the hungry have forsaken the land;  </div><div class='q'>For the barren has born seven,  </div><div class='q'>And she that abounded in children has waxed feeble.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The Lord kills and makes alive;  </div><div class='q'>He brings down to the grave, and brings up.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord makes poor, and makes rich;  </div><div class='q'>He brings low, and lifts up.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He lifts up the poor from the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And raises the needy from the dunghill;  </div><div class='q'>To seat him with the princes of the people,  </div><div class='q'>And causing them to inherit the throne of glory:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Granting his petition to him that prays;  </div><div class='q'>And he blesses the years of the righteous,  </div><div class='q'>For by strength cannot man prevail.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The Lord will weaken his adversary;  </div><div class='q'>The Lord <span class='add'>is</span> holy.  </div><div class='q'>Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom,  </div><div class='q'>Nor let the mighty man boast in his strength,  </div><div class='q'>And let not the rich man boast in his wealth;  </div><div class='q'>But let him that boasts boast in this,  </div><div class='q'>To understand and know the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And to execute judgment and justice in the midst of the earth.  </div><div class='q'>The Lord has gone up to the heavens, and has thundered:  </div><div class='q'>He will judge the extremities of the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And he gives strength to our kings,  </div><div class='q'>And will exalt the horn of his Christ.  </div><div class='p'>And she left him there before the Lord,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and departed to Ramah: and the child ministered in the presence of the Lord before Eli the priest.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the sons of Eli the priest <span class='add'>were</span> evil sons, not knowing the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the priest’s claim from every one of the people that sacrificed <span class='add'>was this</span>: the servant of the priest came when the flesh was in seething, and a fleshhook of three teeth <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he struck it into the great caldron, or into the brazen vessel, or into the pot, and whatever came up with the fleshhook, the priest took for himself: so they did to all Israel that came to sacrifice to the Lord in Shiloh.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And before the fat was burned for a sweet savor, the servant of the priest would come, and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, and I will by no means take of thee sodden flesh out of the caldron.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> the man that sacrificed said, First let the fat be burned, as it is fit, and take for thyself of all things which thy soul desires: then he would say, Nay, for thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for they set at nought the offering of the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girded with a linen ephod.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And his mother made him a little doublet, and brought it to him from year to year, in her going up in company with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, saying, The Lord recompense to thee seed of this woman, in return for the loan which thou hast lent to the Lord: and the man returned to his place.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord visited Hannah, and she bore yet three sons, and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Eli <span class='add'>was</span> very old, and he heard what his sons did to the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he said to them, Why do ye according to this thing, which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Nay <span class='add'>my</span> sons, for the report which I hear <span class='add'>is</span> not good; do not so, for the reports which I hear <span class='add'>are</span> not good, so that the people do not serve God.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>If a man should at all sin against another, then shall they pray for him to the Lord; but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall entreat for him? But they hearkened not to the voice of their father, because the Lord would by all means destroy them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the child Samuel advanced, and was in favor with God and with men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And a man of God came to Eli, and said, Thus says the Lord, I plainly revealed myself to the house of thy father, when they were servants in Egypt to the house of Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I chose the house of thy father out of all the tribes of Israel to minister to me in the priest’s office, to go up to my altar, and to burn incense, and to wear an ephod. And I gave to the house of thy father all the offerings by fire of the children of Israel for food.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And wherefore hast thou looked upon mine incense offering and my meat offering with a shameless eye, and hast honored thy sons above me, so that they should bless themselves with the firstfruits of every sacrifice of Israel before me?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Therefore thus says the Lord God of Israel, I said, Thy house and the house of thy father shall pass before me forever: but now the Lord says, That be far from me; for I will only honor them that honor me, and he that sets me at nought shall be despised.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Behold, the days come when I will destroy thy seed and the seed of thy father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And thou shalt not have an old man in my house forever.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>if</span> I do not destroy a man of thine from my altar, <span class='add'>it shall be</span> that his eyes may fail and his soul may perish; and everyone that remains in thy house shall fall by the sword of men.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this which shall come upon thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas shall be a sign to thee; in one day they shall both die.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will raise up to myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and in my soul; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ forever.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that he that survives in thy house, shall come to do obeisance before him for a little piece of silver, saying, Put me into one of thy priests’ offices to eat bread.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
