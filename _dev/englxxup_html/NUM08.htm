and thou shalt assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord; and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Aaron shall separate the Levites for a gift before the Lord from the children of Israel: and they shall be prepared to perform the works of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the calves; and thou shalt offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a whole burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt set the Levites before the Lord, and before Aaron, and before his sons; and thou shalt give them as a gift before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thou shalt separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and they shall be mine.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And afterward the Levites shall go in to perform the works of the tabernacle of witness; and thou shalt purify them, and present them before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For these are given to me for a present out of the midst of the children of Israel: I have taken them to myself instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel that open every womb.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For every firstborn among the children of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> mine, whether of man or beast: in the day in which I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them to myself.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I took the Levites in the place of every firstborn among the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I gave the Levites presented as a gift to Aaron and his sons out of the midst of the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of witness, and to make atonement for the children of Israel: thus there shall be none among the sons of Israel to draw nigh to the holy things.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the sons of Israel did to them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So the Levites purified themselves and washed their garments; and Aaron presented them as a gift before the Lord, and Aaron made atonement for them to purify them.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And afterward the Levites went in to minister in their service in the tabernacle of witness before Aaron, and before his sons;
