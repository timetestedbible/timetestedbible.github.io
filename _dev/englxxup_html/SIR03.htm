</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Whoso honoreth his father shall have joy of <span class='add'>his own</span> children;  </div><div class='q'>And when he maketh his prayer, he shall be heard.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He that honoreth his father shall have a long life;  </div><div class='q'>And he that is obedient unto the Lord shall be a comfort to his mother,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And will do service unto his parents, as to his masters.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Honor thy father and mother both in word and deed,  </div><div class='q'>That a blessing may come upon thee from them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children;  </div><div class='q'>But the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Glory not in the dishonor of thy father;  </div><div class='q'>For thy father’s dishonor is no glory unto thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For the glory of a man is from the honor of his father;  </div><div class='q'>And a mother in dishonor is a reproach to the children.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>My son, help thy father in his age,  </div><div class='q'>And grieve him not as long as he liveth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And if his understanding fail, have patience with him;  </div><div class='q'>And despise him not when thou art in thy full strength.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten:  </div><div class='q'>And instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered;  </div><div class='q'>Thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer;  </div><div class='q'>And he that angereth his mother is cursed of God.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>My son, go on with thy business in meekness;  </div><div class='q'>So shalt thou be beloved of him that is approved.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The greater thou art, the more humble thyself,  </div><div class='q'>And thou shalt find favor before the Lord.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the power of the Lord is great,  </div><div class='q'>And he is honored of the lowly.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee,  </div><div class='q'>Neither search the things that are above thy strength.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But what is commanded thee, think thereupon <span class='add'>with reverence</span>;  </div><div class='q'>For it is not needful for thee <span class='add'>to see with thine eyes</span> the things that are in secret.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Be not curious in unnecessary matters;  </div><div class='q'>For more things are shown unto thee than men understand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For many are deceived by their own vain opinion;  </div><div class='q'>And an evil suspicion hath overthrown their judgment.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>A stubborn heart shall fare evil at the last;  </div><div class='q'>And he that loveth danger shall perish therein.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrows;  </div><div class='q'>And the wicked man shall heap sin upon sin.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>In the punishment of the proud there is no remedy;  </div><div class='q'>For the plant of wickedness hath taken root in him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>The heart of the prudent will understand a parable;  </div><div class='q'>And an attentive ear is the desire of a wise man.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Water will quench a flaming fire;  </div><div class='q'>And alms maketh an atonement for sins.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he that requiteth good turns is mindful of that which may come hereafter;  </div><div class='q'>And when he falleth, he shall find a stay.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
