<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 26</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the Ziphites come out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, David hides himself with us in the hill Hachilah, opposite Jeshimon.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him <span class='add'>went</span> three thousand men chosen out of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah in front of Jeshimon, by the way, and David dwelt in the wilderness: and David saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And David sent spies, and ascertained that Saul was come prepared out of Keilah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David arose secretly, and goes into the place where Saul was sleeping, and there <span class='add'>was</span> Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul was sleeping in a chariot, and the people had encamped round about him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And David answered and spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah the brother of Joab, saying, Who will go in with me to Saul into the camp? And Abishai said, I will go in with thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So David and Abishai go in among the people by night: and behold, Saul was fast asleep in the chariot, and his spear was stuck in the ground near his head, and Abner and his people slept round about him.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Abishai said to David, The Lord has this day shut up thine enemy into thy hands, and now I will smite him to the earth with the spear to the ground once <span class='add'>for all</span>, and I will not smite him again.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And David said to Abishai, Do not lay him low, for who shall lift up his hand against the anointed of the Lord, and be guiltless?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And David said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, if the Lord smite him not, or his day come and he die, or he go down to battle and be added <span class='add'>to his fathers, do not so</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The Lord forbid it me that I should lift up my hand against the anointed of the Lord: and now take, I pray thee, the spear from his bolster, and the pitcher of water, and let us return home.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So David took the spear, and the pitcher of water from his bolster, and they went home: and there was no one that saw, and no one that knew, and there was no one that awoke, all being asleep, for a stupor from the Lord had fallen upon them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of a hill afar off, and <span class='add'>there was</span> a good distance between them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David called to the people, and spoke to Abner, saying, Wilt thou not answer, Abner? and Abner answered and said, Who art thou that callest?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And David said to Abner, <span class='add'>Art</span> not thou a man? and who <span class='add'>is</span> like thee in Israel? Why then dost thou not guard thy lord the king? for one out of the people went in to destroy thy lord the king.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And this thing <span class='add'>is</span> not good which thou hast done. <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, ye are worthy of death, ye who guard your lord the king, the anointed of the Lord: and now behold, I pray you, the spear of the king, and the cruse of water: where are the articles that should be at his head?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul recognized the voice of David, and said, <span class='add'>Is</span> this thy voice, son David? and David said, I <span class='add'>am</span> thy servant, <span class='add'>my</span> lord, O king.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his servant? for in what have I sinned? and what unrighteousness has been found in me?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now let my lord the king hear the word of his servant. If God stirs thee up against me, let thine offering be acceptable: but if the sons of men, they <span class='add'>are</span> cursed before the Lord, for they have cast me out this day so that I should not be established in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other gods.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And now let not my blood fall to the ground before the Lord, for the king of Israel has come forth to seek thy life, as the night hawk pursues <span class='add'>its prey</span> in the mountains.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Saul said, I have sinned: turn, son David, for I will not hurt thee, because my life was precious in thine eyes; and today I have been foolish and have erred exceedingly.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David answered and said, Behold, the spear of the king: let one of the servants come over and take it.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the Lord shall recompense each according to his righteousness and his truth, since the Lord delivered thee this day into my hands, and I would not lift my hand against the Lord’s anointed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And, behold, as thy life has been precious this very day in my eyes, so let my life be precious before the Lord, and may he protect me, and deliver me out of all affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Saul said to David, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> thou, <span class='add'>my</span> son; and thou shalt surely do valiantly, and surely prevail. And David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
