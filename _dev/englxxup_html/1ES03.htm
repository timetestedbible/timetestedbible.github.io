So they were called, and came in.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerning the writings.  </div><div class='p'>Then began the first, who had spoken of the strength of wine;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! it causeth all men to err that drink it:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>it maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor man and of the rich:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>it turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so that a man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and it maketh every heart rich, so that a man remembereth neither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things by talents:   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and when they are in their cups, they forget their love both to friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>but when they are from the wine, they remember not what they have done.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to do thus?
