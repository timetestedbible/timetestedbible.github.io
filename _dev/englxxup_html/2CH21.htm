Then Libnah at that time revolted from <span class='add'>under</span> his hand, because he forsook the Lord God of his fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For he built high places in the cities of Judah, and caused the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, and led Judah astray.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And there came to him <span class='add'>a message</span> in writing from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of thy father David, Because thou hast not walked in the way of thy father Jehoshaphat, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but hast walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and hast caused Judah and the dwellers in Jerusalem to go a-whoring, as the house of Ahab caused <span class='add'>Israel</span> to go a-whoring, and thou hast slain thy brethren, the sons of thy father, who were better than thyself;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>behold, the Lord shall smite thee with a great plague among thy people, and thy sons, and thy wives, and all thy store:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and thou <span class='add'>shalt be afflicted</span> with a grievous disease, with a disease of the bowels, until thy bowels shall fall out day by day with the sickness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So the Lord stirred up the Philistines against Jehoram, and the Arabians, and those who bordered on the Ethiopians:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and they went up against Judah, and prevailed against them, and took away all the store which they found in the house of the king, and his sons, and his daughters; and there was no son left to him but Ahaziah the youngest of his sons.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And after all these things the Lord smote him in the bowels with an incurable disease.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it continued from day to day: and when the time of the days came <span class='add'>to</span> two years, his bowels fell out with the disease, and he died by a grievous distemper: and his people performed no funeral, like the funeral of his fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>He was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he departed without honor, and was buried in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
