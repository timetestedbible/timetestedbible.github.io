<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light,  </div><div class='q'>Whose voice they hearing, and not seeing their shape,  </div><div class='q'>Because they also had not suffered the same things, they counted them happy.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>But for that they did not hurt them <span class='add'>now</span>, of whom they had been wronged before, they thanked them,  </div><div class='q'>And besought them pardon for that they had been enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire,  </div><div class='q'>Both to be a guide of the unknown journey,  </div><div class='q'>And a harmless sun to entertain them honorably.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For they were worthy to be deprived of light, and imprisoned in darkness,  </div><div class='q'>Who had kept thy sons shut up,  </div><div class='q'>By whom the uncorrupt light of the law was to be given unto the world.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints,  </div><div class='q'>One child being cast forth, and saved,  </div><div class='q'>To reprove them, thou tookest away the multitude of their children,  </div><div class='q'>And destroyedst them all together in a mighty water.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Of that night were our fathers certified afore,  </div><div class='q'>That assuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, they might afterward be of good cheer.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of the righteous,  </div><div class='q'>And destruction of the enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries,  </div><div class='q'>By the same thou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the righteous children of good men did sacrifice secretly,  </div><div class='q'>And with one consent made a holy law,  </div><div class='q'>That the saints should be like partakers  </div><div class='q'>Of the same good and evil,  </div><div class='q'>The fathers now singing out the songs of praise.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry of the enemies,  </div><div class='q'>And a lamentable noise was carried abroad for children that were bewailed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The master and the servant were punished after one manner;  </div><div class='q'>And like as the king, so suffered the common person.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind of death;  </div><div class='q'>Neither were the living sufficient to bury them:  </div><div class='q'>For in one moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For whereas they would not believe anything by reason of the enchantments;  </div><div class='q'>Upon the destruction of the firstborn, they acknowledged this people to be the sons of God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For while all things were in quiet silence,  </div><div class='q'>And that night was in the midst of her swift course,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thine Almighty word leaped from heaven out of thy royal throne,  </div><div class='q'>As a fierce man of war into the midst of a land of destruction,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword,  </div><div class='q'>And standing up filled all things with death;  </div><div class='q'>And it touched the heaven, but it stood upon the earth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore,  </div><div class='q'>And terrors came upon them unlooked for.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And one thrown here, and another there, half dead,  </div><div class='q'>Showed the cause of his death.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the dreams that troubled them did foreshow this,  </div><div class='q'>Lest they should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also,  </div><div class='q'>And there was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness:  </div><div class='q'>But the wrath endured not long.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth to defend them;  </div><div class='q'>And bringing the shield of his proper ministry,  </div><div class='q'>Even prayer, and the propitiation of incense,  </div><div class='q'>Set himself against the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end,  </div><div class='q'>Declaring that he was thy servant.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So he overcame the destroyer, not with might of body,  </div><div class='q'>Nor force of arms,  </div><div class='q'>But with a word subdued him that punished,  </div><div class='q'>Alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one upon another,  </div><div class='q'>Standing between, he stayed the wrath,  </div><div class='q'>And parted the way to the living.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For in the long garment was the whole world,  </div><div class='q'>And in the four rows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven,  </div><div class='q'>And thy Majesty upon the diadem of his head.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Unto these the destroyer gave place, and they were afraid of them:  </div><div class='q'>For it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
