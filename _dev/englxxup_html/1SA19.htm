<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 19</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to slay David.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Jonathan, Saul’s son, loved David much: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul seeks to kill thee: take heed to thyself therefore tomorrow morning, and hide thyself, and dwell in secret.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I will go forth, and stand near my father in the field where thou shalt be, and I will speak concerning thee to my father; and I will see what his answer may be, and I will tell thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Jonathan spoke favorably concerning David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against thy servant David, for he has not sinned against thee, and his deeds <span class='add'>are</span> very good.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great deliverance; and all Israel saw, and rejoiced: why then dost thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, saying, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, he shall not die.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words; and Jonathan brought David in to Saul, and he was before him as in former times.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And there was again war against Saul; and David did valiantly, and fought against the Philistines, and smote them with a very great slaughter, and they fled from before him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And an evil spirit from God was upon Saul, and he was resting in his house, and a spear <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand, and David was playing on the harp with his hands.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Saul sought to smite David with the spear; and David withdrew <span class='add'>suddenly</span> from the presence of Saul; and he drove the spear into the wall; and David retreated and escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass in that night, that Saul sent messengers to the house of David to watch him, in order to slay him in the morning; and Michal David’s wife told him, saying, Unless thou save thy life this night, tomorrow thou shalt be slain.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Michal lets David down by the window, and he departed, and fled, and escaped.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Michal took images, and laid them on the bed, and she put the liver of a goat by his head, and covered them with clothes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Saul sent messengers to take David; and they say that he is sick.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he sends to David, saying, Bring him to me on the bed, that I may slay him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the messengers come, and, behold, the images <span class='add'>were</span> on the bed, and the goat’s liver at his head.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said to Michal, Why hast thou thus deceived me, and suffered my enemy to depart, and he has escaped? and Michal said to Saul, He said, Let me go, and if not, I will slay thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>So David fled, and escaped, and comes to Samuel to Ramah, and tells him all that Saul had done to him: and Samuel and David went, and dwelt in Naioth in Ramah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David <span class='add'>is</span> in Naioth in Ramah.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samuel stood <span class='add'>as</span> appointed over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesy.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied: and Saul sent again a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul was very angry, and went himself also to Ramah, and he comes as far as the well of the threshing floor that is in Secu; and he asked and said, Where <span class='add'>are</span> Samuel and David? and they said, Behold, in Naioth in Ramah.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went thence to Naioth in Ramah: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Naioth in Ramah.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said, <span class='add'>Is</span> Saul also among the prophets?
