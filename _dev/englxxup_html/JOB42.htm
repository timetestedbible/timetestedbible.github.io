<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 42</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Job answered and said to the Lord,   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know that thou canst do all things,  </div><div class='q'>And nothing is impossible with thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For who is he that hides counsel from thee?  </div><div class='q'>Or who keeps back his words, and thinks to hide them from thee?  </div><div class='q'>And who will tell me what I knew not,  </div><div class='q'>Great and wonderful things which I understood not?   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>But hear me, O Lord, that I also may speak:  </div><div class='q'>And I will ask thee, and do thou teach me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I have heard the report of thee by the ear before;  </div><div class='q'>But now mine eye has seen thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Wherefore I have counted myself vile, and have fainted:  </div><div class='q'>And I esteem myself dust and ashes.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass after the Lord had spoken all these words to Job, <span class='add'>that</span> the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite,  </div><div class='q'>Thou hast sinned, and thy two friends:  </div><div class='q'>For ye have not said anything true before me,  </div><div class='q'>As my servant Job <span class='add'>has</span>.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now then take seven bullocks, and seven rams,  </div><div class='q'>And go to my servant Job,  </div><div class='q'>And he shall offer a burnt offering for you.  </div><div class='q'>And my servant Job shall pray for you,  </div><div class='q'>For I will only accept him:  </div><div class='q'>For but for his sake, I would have destroyed you,  </div><div class='q'>For ye have not spoken the truth against my servant Job.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Minaean,  </div><div class='q'>Went and did as the Lord commanded them:  </div><div class='q'>And he pardoned their sin for the sake of Job.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord prospered Job:  </div><div class='q'>And when he prayed also for his friends, he forgave them <span class='add'>their</span> sin:  </div><div class='q'>And the Lord gave Job twice as much, even the double of what he had before.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And all his brethren and his sisters heard  </div><div class='q'>All that had happened to him,  </div><div class='q'>And they came to him,  </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>so did</span> all that had known him from the first:  </div><div class='q'>And they ate and drank with him, and comforted him,  </div><div class='q'>And wondered at all that the Lord had brought upon him:  </div><div class='q'>And each one gave him a lamb, and four drachma’s weight of gold, even of unstamped <span class='add'>gold</span>.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job, <span class='add'>more</span> than the beginning:  </div><div class='q'>And his cattle were fourteen thousand sheep,  </div><div class='q'>Six thousand camels,  </div><div class='q'>A thousand yoke of oxen,  </div><div class='q'>A thousand she-asses of the pastures.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he called the first, Day,  </div><div class='q'>And the second, Keziah,  </div><div class='q'>And the third, Amalthaea’s horn.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there were not found in comparison with the daughters of Job, fairer <span class='add'>women</span> than they in all the world:  </div><div class='q'>And their father gave them an inheritance among their brethren.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Job lived after <span class='add'>his</span> affliction a hundred and seventy years:  </div><div class='q'>And all the years he lived were two hundred and forty:  </div><div class='q'>And Job saw his sons and his sons’ sons, the fourth generation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Job died, an old man and full of days:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">17a&#160;</span>And it is written that he will rise again with those whom the Lord raises up.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">17b&#160;</span>This man is described in the Syriac book  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>As</span> living in the land of Uz, on the borders of Edom and Arabia:  </div><div class='q'>And his name before was Jobab;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">17c&#160;</span>And having taken an Arabian wife, he begot a son whose name was Ennon.  </div><div class='q'>And he himself was the son of his father Zerah, one of the sons of Esau, and of his mother Bosorrha,  </div><div class='q'>So that he was the fifth from Abraham.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">17d&#160;</span>And these were the kings who reigned in Edom, which country he also ruled over:  </div><div class='q'>First, Bela, the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dinhabah:  </div><div class='q'>But after Bela, Jobab, who is called Job:  </div><div class='q'>And after him Husham, who was governor out of the country of Teman:  </div><div class='q'>And after him Hadad, the son of Bedad, who destroyed Midian in the plain of Moab; and the name of his city was Getthaim.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">17e&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>his</span> friends who came to him were  </div><div class='q'>Eliphaz, of the children of Esau, king of the Temanites,  </div><div class='q'>Bildad sovereign of the Shuhites,  </div><div class='q'>Zophar king of the Naamathites.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
