 </div><div class='q'>But a wise man will quell them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>A bold man oppresses the poor by ungodly deeds.  </div><div class='q'>As an impetuous and unprofitable rain,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So they that forsake the law praise ungodliness;  </div><div class='q'>But they that love the law fortify themselves with a wall.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Evil men will not understand judgment:  </div><div class='q'>But they that seek the Lord will understand everything.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A poor man walking in truth is better than a rich liar.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>A wise son keeps the law:  </div><div class='q'>But he that keeps up debauchery dishonors his father.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He that increases his wealth by usuries and <span class='add'>unjust</span> gains,  </div><div class='q'>Gathers it for him that pities the poor.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that turns away his ear from hearing the law,  </div><div class='q'>Even he has made his prayer abominable.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
