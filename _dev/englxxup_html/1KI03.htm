So they spoke before the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the king said to them, Thou sayest, This <span class='add'>is</span> my son, <span class='add'>even</span> the living <span class='add'>one</span>, and this woman’s son <span class='add'>is</span> the dead one: and thou sayest, No, but the living <span class='add'>is</span> my son, and the dead <span class='add'>is</span> thy son.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king said, Fetch a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said, Divide the live child, the suckling, in two; and give half of it to one, and half of it to the other.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the woman whose the living child was, answered and spoke to the king (for her bowels yearned over her son), and she said, I pray thee, <span class='add'>my</span> lord, give her the child, and in nowise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor hers; divide <span class='add'>it</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her that said, Give it to her, and by no means slay it: she <span class='add'>is</span> its mother.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And all Israel heard this judgment which the king judged, and they feared before the king; because they saw that the wisdom of God <span class='add'>was</span> in him, to execute judgment.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
