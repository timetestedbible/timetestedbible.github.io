<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 17</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed:  </div><div class='q'>Therefore unnurtured souls have erred.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation;  </div><div class='q'>They being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness, and fettered with the bonds of a long night,  </div><div class='q'>Lay <span class='add'>there</span> exiled from the eternal providence.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For while they supposed to lie hidden in their secret sins,  </div><div class='q'>They were scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness,  </div><div class='q'>Being horribly astonished,  </div><div class='q'>And troubled with <span class='add'>strange</span> apparitions.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For neither might the corner that held them keep them from fear:  </div><div class='q'>But noises <span class='add'>as of waters</span> falling down sounded about them,  </div><div class='q'>And sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>No power of the fire might give them light:  </div><div class='q'>Neither could the bright flames of the stars  </div><div class='q'>Endure to lighten that horrible night.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Only there appeared unto them  </div><div class='q'>A fire kindled of itself, very dreadful:  </div><div class='q'>For being much terrified, they thought the things which they saw  </div><div class='q'>To be worse than the sight they saw not.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>As for the illusions of art magic, they were put down,  </div><div class='q'>And their vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troubles from a sick soul,  </div><div class='q'>Were sick themselves of fear, worthy to be laughed at.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For though no terrible thing did fear them;  </div><div class='q'>Yet being scared with beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They died for fear,  </div><div class='q'>Denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very timorous,  </div><div class='q'>And being pressed with conscience, always forecasteth grievous things.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succors which reason offereth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the expectation from within, being less,  </div><div class='q'>Counteth the ignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But they sleeping the same sleep that night,  </div><div class='q'>Which was indeed intolerable,  </div><div class='q'>And which came upon them out of the bottoms of inevitable hell,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions,  </div><div class='q'>And partly fainted, their heart failing them:  </div><div class='q'>For a sudden fear, and not looked for, came upon them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept,  </div><div class='q'>Shut up in a prison without iron bars.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd,  </div><div class='q'>Or a laborer in the field,  </div><div class='q'>He was overtaken, and endured that necessity, which could not be avoided:  </div><div class='q'>For they were all bound with one chain of darkness.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Whether it were a whistling wind,  </div><div class='q'>Or a melodious noise of birds among the spreading branches,  </div><div class='q'>Or a pleasing fall of water running violently,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Or a terrible sound of stones cast down,  </div><div class='q'>Or a running that could not be seen of skipping beasts,  </div><div class='q'>Or a roaring voice of most savage wild beasts,  </div><div class='q'>Or a rebounding echo from the hollow mountains:  </div><div class='q'>These things made them to swoon for fear.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For the whole world shined with clear light,  </div><div class='q'>And none were hindered in their labor:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Over them only was spread a heavy night,  </div><div class='q'>An image of that darkness which should afterward receive them:  </div><div class='q'>But yet were they unto themselves more grievous than the darkness.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
