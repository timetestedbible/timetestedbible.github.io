And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to thee and to thy father’s house?   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjaminite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou spoken to me according to this word?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave thee, which I told thee to set by thee.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Now the cook <span class='add'>had</span> boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set it before thee, and eat; for it is set thee for a testimony in preference to the others; take <span class='add'>of it</span>: and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the morning dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss thee. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do thou stand as today, and hearken to the word of God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
