And he gave it to the workmen in the house of the Lord, to repair the breaches of the house,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span><span class='add'>even</span> to the carpenters, and builders, and masons, <span class='add'>and</span> also to purchase timber and hewn stones, to repair the breaches of the house.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Only they did not call them to account for the money that was given to them, because they dealt faithfully.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the Lord. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he went into the house of the Lord to the king, and reported the matter to the king, and said, Thy servants have collected the money that was found in the house of the Lord, and have given it into the hand of the workmen that are appointed in the house of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Shaphan the scribe spoke to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for all the people, and for all Judah, and concerning the words of this book that has been found: for the wrath of the Lord that has been kindled against us <span class='add'>is</span> great, because our fathers hearkened not to the words of this book, to do according to all the things written concerning us.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Hilkiah the priest went, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, to Huldah the prophetess, the mother of Shallum the son of Tikvah son of Harhas, keeper of the robes; and she dwelt in Jerusalem in Masena; and they spoke to her.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And she said to them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Say to the man that sent you to me,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I bring evil upon this place, and upon them that dwell in it, <span class='add'>even</span> all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>because they have forsaken me, and burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me with the works of their hands: therefore my wrath shall burn forth against this place, and shall not be quenched.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And to the king of Judah that sent you to inquire of the Lord—thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, <span class='add'>As for</span> the words which thou hast heard;   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>because thy heart was softened, and thou wast humbled before <span class='add'>me</span>, when thou heardest all that I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, that it should be utterly destroyed and accursed, and thou didst rend thy garments, and weep before me; I also have heard, saith the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>It shall not be so <span class='add'>therefore</span>: behold, I <span class='add'>will</span> add thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy tomb in peace, and thine eyes shall not see <span class='add'>any</span> among all the evils which I bring upon this place.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
