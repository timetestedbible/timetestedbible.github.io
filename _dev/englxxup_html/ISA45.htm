I am the Lord God, and there is none beside.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom <span class='add'>with</span> mercy, and bring forth righteousness likewise: I am the Lord that created thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>What excellent thing have I prepared as clay of the potter?
