And it came to pass in the month Chislev, of the twentieth year, that I was in Susa the palace.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and <span class='add'>some</span> men of Judah; and I asked them concerning those that had escaped, who had been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said to me, The remnant, <span class='add'>even</span> those that are left of the captivity, <span class='add'>are</span> there in the land, in great distress and reproach: and the walls of Jerusalem <span class='add'>are</span> thrown down, and its gates are burned with fire.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, <span class='add'>that</span> I sat down and wept, and mourned for <span class='add'>several</span> days, and continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I said, Nay, I pray thee, O Lord God of heaven, the mighty, the great and terrible, keeping thy covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to those that keep his commandments:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>let now thine ear be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, this day <span class='add'>both</span> day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and make confession for the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and the house of my father have sinned.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>We have altogether broken <span class='add'>covenant</span> with thee, and we have not kept the commandments, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which thou didst command thy servant Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Remember, I pray thee, the word wherewith thou didst charge thy servant Moses, saying, If ye break covenant <span class='add'>with me</span>, I will disperse you among the nations.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But if ye turn again to me, and keep my commandments, and do them; if ye should be scattered under the utmost <span class='add'>bound</span> of heaven, thence will I gather them, and I will bring them into the place which I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now they <span class='add'>are</span> thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed with thy great power, and with thy strong hand.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span><span class='add'>Turn</span> not <span class='add'>away</span>, I pray thee, O Lord, but let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and cause him to find mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was the king’s cupbearer.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
