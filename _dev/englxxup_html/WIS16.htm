<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 16</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Therefore by the like were they punished worthily,  </div><div class='q'>And by the multitude of beasts tormented.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thine own people,  </div><div class='q'>Thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste,  </div><div class='q'>Even quails to stir up their appetite:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>To the end that they, desiring food,  </div><div class='q'>Might for the ugly sight of the beasts sent among them  </div><div class='q'>Loath even that, which they must needs desire;  </div><div class='q'>But these, suffering penury for a short space,  </div><div class='q'>Might be made partakers of a strange taste.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyranny should come penury, which they could not avoid:  </div><div class='q'>But to these it should only be shown how their enemies were tormented.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these,  </div><div class='q'>And they perished with the stings of crooked serpents,  </div><div class='q'>Thy wrath endured not forever:   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But they were troubled for a small season, that they might be admonished,  </div><div class='q'>Having a sign of salvation, to put them in remembrance of the commandment of thy law.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by the thing that he saw,  </div><div class='q'>But by thee, that art the Savior of all.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And in this thou madest thine enemies confess,  </div><div class='q'>That it is thou who deliverest from all evil:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed,  </div><div class='q'>Neither was there found any remedy for their life:  </div><div class='q'>For they were worthy to be punished by such.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragons overcame:  </div><div class='q'>For thy mercy was by them, and healed them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words;  </div><div class='q'>And were quickly saved,  </div><div class='q'>That not falling into deep forgetfulness,  </div><div class='q'>They might be continually mindful of thy goodness.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaster, that restored them to health:  </div><div class='q'>But thy word, O Lord, which healeth all things.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For thou hast power of life and death:  </div><div class='q'>Thou leadest to the gates of hell, and bringest up again.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>A man indeed killeth through his malice:  </div><div class='q'>And the spirit, when it is gone forth, returneth not;  </div><div class='q'>Neither the soul received up cometh again.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But it is not possible to escape thy hand.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For the ungodly, that denied to know thee,  </div><div class='q'>Were scourged by the strength of thine arm:  </div><div class='q'>With strange rains, hails, and showers, were they persecuted, that they could not avoid,  </div><div class='q'>And through fire were they consumed.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For, which is most to be wondered at,  </div><div class='q'>The fire had more force in the water, that quencheth all things:  </div><div class='q'>For the world fighteth for the righteous.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For sometime the flame was mitigated,  </div><div class='q'>That it might not burn up the beasts that were sent against the ungodly;  </div><div class='q'>But themselves might see and perceive that they were persecuted with the judgment of God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And at another time it burneth even in the midst of water above the power of fire,  </div><div class='q'>That it might destroy the fruits of an unjust land.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels’ food,  </div><div class='q'>And didst send them from heaven bread prepared without their labor,  </div><div class='q'>Able to content every man’s delight, and agreeing to every taste.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children,  </div><div class='q'>And serving to the appetite of the eater,  </div><div class='q'>Tempered itself to every man’s liking.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not,  </div><div class='q'>That they might know that fire burning in the hail,  </div><div class='q'>And sparkling in the rain,  </div><div class='q'>Did destroy the fruits of the enemies.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But this again did even forget his own strength,  </div><div class='q'>That the righteous might be nourished.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Maker,  </div><div class='q'>Increaseth his strength against the unrighteous for their punishment,  </div><div class='q'>And abateth his strength for the benefit of such as put their trust in thee.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions,  </div><div class='q'>And was obedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things,  </div><div class='q'>According to the desire of them that had need:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know,  </div><div class='q'>That it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man:  </div><div class='q'>But that it is thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For that which was not destroyed of the fire,  </div><div class='q'>Being warmed with a little sunbeam, soon melted away:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to give thee thanks,  </div><div class='q'>And at the dayspring pray unto thee.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as the winter’s hoar frost,  </div><div class='q'>And shall run away as unprofitable water.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
