 </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>The fathers</span> declaring the praises of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And his mighty acts,  </div><div class='q'>And his wonders which he wrought.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he raised up a testimony in Jacob,  </div><div class='q'>And appointed a law in Israel,  </div><div class='q'>Which he commanded our fathers,  </div><div class='q'>To make it known to their children:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>That another generation might know,  </div><div class='q'>Even the sons which should be born;  </div><div class='q'>And they should arise and declare them to their children.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>That they might set their hope on God,  </div><div class='q'>And not forget the works of God,  </div><div class='q'>But diligently seek his commandments.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>That they should not be as their fathers,  </div><div class='q'>A perverse and provoking generation;  </div><div class='q'>A generation which set not its heart aright,  </div><div class='q'>And its spirit was not steadfast with God.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting <span class='add'>with</span> the bow,  </div><div class='q'>Turned <span class='add'>back</span> in the day of battle.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They kept not the covenant of God,  </div><div class='q'>And would not walk in his law.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they forgot his benefits,  </div><div class='q'>And his miracles which he <span class='add'>had</span> shown them;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The miracles which he wrought before their fathers,  </div><div class='q'>In the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanis.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He clove the sea, and led them through:  </div><div class='q'>He made the waters to stand as <span class='add'>in</span> a bottle.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he guided them with a cloud by day,  </div><div class='q'>And all the night with a light of fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>He clove a rock in the wilderness,  </div><div class='q'>And made them drink as in a great deep.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he brought water out of the rock,  </div><div class='q'>And caused waters to flow down as rivers.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they sinned yet more against him;  </div><div class='q'>They provoked the Most High in the wilderness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they tempted God in their hearts,  </div><div class='q'>In asking meat for <span class='add'>the desire of</span> their souls.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>They spoke also against God, and said,  </div><div class='q'>Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed,  </div><div class='q'>And the torrents ran abundantly;

 </div><div class='q'>He sent them provision to the full.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>He removed the south wind from heaven;  </div><div class='q'>And by his might he brought in the southwest wind.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he rained upon them flesh like dust,  </div><div class='q'>And feathered birds like the sand of the seas.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they fell into the midst of their camp,  </div><div class='q'>Round about their tents.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So they ate, and were completely filled;  </div><div class='q'>And he gave them their desire.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>They were not disappointed of their desire:  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>But</span> when their food was yet in their mouth,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then the indignation of God rose up against them,  </div><div class='q'>And slew the fattest of them,  </div><div class='q'>And overthrew the choice men of Israel.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>In the midst of all this they sinned yet more,  </div><div class='q'>And believed not his miracles.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And their days were consumed in vanity,  </div><div class='q'>And their years with anxiety.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>When he slew them, they sought him:  </div><div class='q'>And they returned and called betimes upon God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they remembered that God was their helper,  </div><div class='q'>And the most high God was their redeemer.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Yet they loved him <span class='add'>only</span> with their mouth,  </div><div class='q'>And lied to him with their tongue.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>For their heart <span class='add'>was</span> not right with him,  </div><div class='q'>Neither were they steadfast in his covenant.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>But he is compassionate,  </div><div class='q'>And will forgive their sins, and will not destroy <span class='add'>them</span>:  </div><div class='q'>Yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath,  </div><div class='q'>And will not kindle all his anger.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he remembered that they are flesh;  </div><div class='q'>A wind that passes away, and returns not.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>How often did they provoke him in the wilderness,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>And</span> anger him in a dry land!   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Yea, they turned back, and tempted God,  </div><div class='q'>And provoked the Holy One of Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>They remembered not his hand,  </div><div class='q'>The day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt,  </div><div class='q'>And his wonders in the field of Tanis:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And had changed their rivers into blood;  </div><div class='q'>And their streams, that they should not drink.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>He sent against them the dog fly, and it devoured them;  </div><div class='q'>And the frog, and it spoiled them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he gave their fruit to the canker worm,  </div><div class='q'>And their labors to the locust.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>He killed their vines with hail,  </div><div class='q'>And their sycamores with frost.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he gave up their cattle to hail,  </div><div class='q'>And their substance to the fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>He sent out against them the fury of his anger,  </div><div class='q'>Wrath, and indignation, and affliction,  </div><div class='q'>A message by evil angels.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>He made a way for his wrath;  </div><div class='q'>He spared not their souls from death,  </div><div class='q'>But consigned their cattle to death;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt;  </div><div class='q'>The firstfruits of their labors in the tents of Ham.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he removed his people like sheep;  </div><div class='q'>He led them as a flock in the wilderness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And he guided them with hope, and they feared not:  </div><div class='q'>But the sea covered their enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary,  </div><div class='q'>This mountain which his right hand had purchased.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And he cast out the nations from before them,  </div><div class='q'>And made them to inherit by a line of inheritance,  </div><div class='q'>And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God,  </div><div class='q'>And kept not his testimonies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers:  </div><div class='q'>They became like a crooked bow.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And they provoked him with their high places,  </div><div class='q'>And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>God heard and lightly regarded <span class='add'>them</span>,  </div><div class='q'>And greatly despised Israel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh,  </div><div class='q'>His tent where he dwelt among men.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And he gave their strength into captivity,  </div><div class='q'>And their beauty into the enemy’s hand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And he gave his people to the sword;  </div><div class='q'>And disdained his inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Fire devoured their young men;  </div><div class='q'>And their virgins mourned not.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>Their priests fell by the sword;

</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph,  </div><div class='q'>And chose not the tribe of Ephraim;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>But chose the tribe of Judah,  </div><div class='q'>The Mount Zion which he loved.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>And he built his sanctuary as <span class='add'>the place</span> of unicorns;
