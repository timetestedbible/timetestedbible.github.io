And Achish said to David, So will I make thee captain of my bodyguard continually.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Ramah. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Shunem: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gilboa.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Saul inquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and inquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a woman who has in her a divining spirit at En-dor.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the divining spirit within thee, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the woman said to him, Behold now, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why dost thou spread a snare for my life to destroy it?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Saul swore to her, and said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, no injury shall come upon thee on this account.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to thee? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom thou hast seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he said to her, What didst thou perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he <span class='add'>was</span> clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer hearkens to me either by the hand of prophets or by dreams: and now I have called thee to tell me what I shall do.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Why askest thou me, whereas the Lord has departed from thee, and taken part with thy neighbor?   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord has done to thee, as the Lord spoke by me; and the Lord will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbor David,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to thee this day.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord shall deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, thy handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have heard the words which thou hast spoken to me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And now hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thy handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and thou shalt be strengthened, for thou wilt be going on thy way.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hastened and slew it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And she brought <span class='add'>the meat</span> before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
