  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose up early, and built there an altar, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace offerings.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the children of Israel said, Who of all the tribes of Israel, went not up in the congregation to the Lord? for there was a great oath concerning those who went not up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of Israel relented toward Benjamin their brother, and said, Today one tribe is cut off from Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>What shall we do for wives for the rest that remain? whereas we have sworn by the Lord, not to give them of our daughters for wives.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And they said, What one <span class='add'>man is there</span> of the tribes of Israel, who went not up to the Lord to Mizpah? and, behold, no man came to the camp from Jabesh-gilead to the assembly.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the people were numbered, and there was not there a man from the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the strongest, and they charged them, saying, Go ye and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And this shall ye do: every male and every woman that has known the lying with man ye shall devote <span class='add'>to destruction</span>, but the virgins ye shall save alive: and they did so.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to Shiloh in the land of Canaan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And all the congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin in the rock Rimmon, and invited them to <span class='add'>make</span> peace.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Benjamin returned to the children of Israel at that time, and the children of Israel gave them the women whom they <span class='add'>had</span> saved alive of the daughters of Jabesh-gilead; and they were content.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the people relented for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for them that remain? for the women have been destroyed out of Benjamin.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they said, <span class='add'>There must be</span> an inheritance of them that are escaped of Benjamin; and <span class='add'>so</span> a tribe shall not be destroyed out of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For we shall not be able to give them wives of our daughters, because we swore among the children of Israel, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>is</span> he that gives a wife to Benjamin.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they said, Lo! now <span class='add'>there is</span> a feast of the Lord from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, eastward on the way that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and from the south of Lebonah.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they charged the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and ye shall see; and lo! if there come out the daughters of the inhabitants of Shiloh to dance in dances, then shall ye go out of the vineyards and seize for yourselves every man a wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go ye into the land of Benjamin.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass, when their fathers or their brethren come to dispute with us, that we will say to them, Grant them freely to us, for we have not taken every man his wife in the battle: because ye did not give to them according to the occasion, ye transgressed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the children of Benjamin did so; and they took wives according to their number from the dancers whom they seized: and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt in them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the children of Israel went thence at that time every man to his tribe and his kindred; and they went thence every man to his inheritance.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And in those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own sight.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
