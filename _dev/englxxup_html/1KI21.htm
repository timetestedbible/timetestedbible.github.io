And the men departed, and carried back the answer to him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the son of Hadad sent to him, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for foxes to all the people, even my infantry.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king of Israel answered and said, Let it be sufficient; let not the humpbacked boast as he that is upright.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And it came to pass when he returned him this answer, he and all the kings with him were drinking in tents: and he said to his servants, Form a trench. And they made a trench against the city.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And, behold, a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the Lord, Hast thou seen this great multitude? behold, I give it this day into thy hands; and thou shalt know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Ahab said, Whereby? And he said, Thus saith the Lord, By the young men of the heads of the districts. And Ahab said, Who shall begin the battle? and he said, Thou.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Ahab numbered the young men the heads of the districts, and they were two hundred and thirty: and afterward he numbered the people, <span class='add'>even</span> every man fit for war, seven thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he went forth at noon, and the son of Hadad was drinking <span class='add'>and</span> getting drunk in Succoth, he and the kings, <span class='add'>even</span> thirty and two kings, his allies.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the young men the heads of the districts went forth first; and they send and report to the king of Syria, saying, There are men come forth out of Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to them, If they come forth peaceably, take them alive; and if they come forth to war, take them alive:   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and let not the young men the heads of the districts go forth of the city. And the force that was behind them   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>smote each one the man next to him; and each one a second time smote the man next to him: and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them; and the son of Hadad, <span class='add'>even</span> the king of Syria, escapes on the horse of a horseman.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the king of Israel went forth, and took all the horses and the chariots, and smote <span class='add'>the enemy</span> with a great slaughter in Syria.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said, Strengthen thyself, and observe, and see what thou shalt do; for at the return of the year the son of Hadad king of Syria comes up against thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the servants of the king of Syria, even they said, The God of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> a God of mountains, and not a God of valleys; therefore has he prevailed against us: but if we should fight against them in the plain, verily we shall prevail against them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And do thou this thing: Send away the kings, each one to his place, and set princes in their stead.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And we will give thee <span class='add'>another</span> army according to the army that was destroyed, and cavalry according to the cavalry, and chariots according to the chariots, and we will fight against them in the plain, and we shall prevail against them. And he hearkened to their voice, and did so.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that the son of Hadad reviewed Syria, and went up to Aphek to war against Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the children of Israel were numbered, and came to meet them: and Israel encamped before them as two little flocks of goats, but Syria filled the land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And there came the man of God, and said to the king of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Because Syria has said, The Lord God of Israel <span class='add'>is</span> a God of the hills, and he <span class='add'>is</span> not a God of the valleys, therefore will I give this great army into thy hand, and thou shalt know that I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And they encamp one over against the other before them seven days. And it came to pass on the seventh day that the battle drew on, and Israel smote Syria, <span class='add'>even</span> a hundred thousand footmen in one day.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand men that were left: and the son of Hadad fled, and entered into an inner chamber, into a closet.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said to his servants, I know that the kings of Israel are merciful kings: let us now put sackcloth upon our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and let us go forth to the king of Israel, if by any means he will save our souls alive.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>So they girded sackcloth upon their loins, and put ropes upon their heads, and said to the king of Israel, Thy servant the son of Hadad says, Let our souls live, I pray thee. And he said, Does he yet live? He is my brother.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the men divined, and offered drink offerings; and they caught the word out of his mouth, and said, Thy brother the son of Hadad. And he said, Go ye in and fetch him. And the son of Hadad went out to him, and they cause him to go up to him into the chariot.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And he said to him, The cities which my father took from thy father I will restore to thee; and thou shalt make streets for thyself in Damascus, as my father made streets in Samaria; and I will let thee go with a covenant. And he made a covenant with him, and let him go.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray. And the man would not smite him.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said to him, Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, therefore, behold, as thou departest from me, a lion shall smite thee: and he departed from him, and a lion found him, and smote him.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he finds another man, and says, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, and in smiting wounded <span class='add'>him</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And the prophet went and stood before the king of Israel by the way, and bound his eyes with a bandage.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And it came to pass as the king passed by, that he cried aloud to the king, and said, Thy servant went out to war, and, behold, a man brought <span class='add'>another</span> man to me, and said to me, Keep this man; and if he should by any means escape, then thy life shall go for his life, or thou shalt pay a talent of silver.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And it came to pass, that thy servant looked round this way and that way, and the man was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Behold, thou hast also destroyed snares <span class='add'>set</span> for me.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he hastened, and took away the bandage from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognized him, that he was one of the prophets.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And he said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast suffered to escape out of thy hand a man appointed to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the king of Israel departed confounded and discouraged, and came to Samaria.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
