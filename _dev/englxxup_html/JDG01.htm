and the Lord delivered the Canaanite and the Perizzite into their hands, and they smote them in Bezek to <span class='add'>the number of</span> ten thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they overtook Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they smote the Canaanite and the Perizzite.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and took him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered <span class='add'>their food</span> under my table: as I therefore have done, so God has recompensed me: and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and they burned the city with fire.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight with the Canaanite dwelling in the hill country, and the south, and the plain country.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Judah went to the Canaanite who dwelt in Hebron; and Hebron came out against him; and the name of Hebron before was Kiriath-arba-sepher: and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, children of Anak.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir; but the name of Debir was before Kiriath-sepher, the city of Letters.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Caleb said, Whosoever shall smite the city of Letters, and shall first take it, I will give to him Achsah my daughter to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Othniel the younger son of Kenaz the brother of Caleb took it; and Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass as she went in, that Othniel urged her to ask a field of her father; and she murmured and cried from off her ass, Thou hast sent me forth into a south land: and Caleb said to her, What is thy request?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Achsah said to him, Give me, I pray thee, a blessing, for thou hast sent me forth into a south land, and thou shalt give me the ransom of water: and Caleb gave her according to her heart the ransom of the upper <span class='add'>springs</span> and the ransom of the low <span class='add'>springs</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of Jethro the Kenite the father-in-law of Moses went up from the city of palm trees with the children of Judah, to the wilderness that is in the south of Judah, which is at the descent of Arad, and they dwelt with the people.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and smote the Canaanite that inhabited Zephath, and they utterly destroyed them; and they called the name of the city Anathema.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Judah did not inherit Gaza nor her coasts, nor Ashkelon nor her coasts, nor Ekron nor her coasts, <span class='add'>nor</span> Ashdod nor the lands around it.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the Lord was with Judah, and he inherited the mountain; for they were not able to destroy the inhabitants of the valley, for Rechab prevented them.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses said; and thence he inherited the three cities of the children of Anak.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the children of Benjamin did not take the inheritance of the Jebusite who dwelt in Jerusalem;

and the Lord was with them.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they encamped and surveyed Bethel: and the name of the city before was Luz.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the spies looked, and behold, a man went out of the city, and they took him; and they said to him, Show us the way into the city, and we will deal mercifully with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he showed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and his family.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the man went into the land of <span class='add'>the</span> Hittites, and built there a city, and called the name of it Luz; this <span class='add'>is</span> its name until this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Manasseh did not drive out <span class='add'>the inhabitants of</span> Beth-shean, which is a city of Scythians, nor her towns, nor her suburbs;

and the Canaanite began to dwell in this land.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that he made the Canaanite tributary, but did not utterly drive them out.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer; and the Canaanite dwelt in the midst of him in Gezer, and became tributary.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Domana: and the Canaanite dwelt in the midst of them, and became tributary to them.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, and <span class='add'>that people</span> became tributary to him, nor the inhabitants of Dor, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor the inhabitants of Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbah, nor Nai, nor Rehob.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Asher dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite who inhabited the land, for he could not drive him out.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; and Naphtali dwelt in the midst of the Canaanite who inhabited the land: but the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributary to them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the Amorite drove out the children of Dan into the mountain, for they did not suffer them to come down into the valley.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Amorite began to dwell in the mountain of shells, in which <span class='add'>are</span> bears, and foxes, in Myrsinon, and in Shaalbim;
