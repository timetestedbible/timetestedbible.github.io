So both I and thy people shall be glorified beyond all the nations, as many as are upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, I will also do for thee this thing, which thou hast spoken; for thou hast found grace before me, and I know thee above all.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Moses</span> says, Manifest thyself to me.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>God</span> said, I will pass by before thee with my glory, and I will call by my name, the Lord, before thee; and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and will have pity on whom I will have pity.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>God</span> said, Thou shalt not be able to see my face; for no man shall see my face, and live.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> a place by me: thou shalt stand upon the rock;   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and when my glory shall pass by, then I will put thee into a hole of the rock; and I will cover thee over with my hand, until I shall have passed by.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And I will remove my hand, and then shalt thou see my back parts; but my face shall not appear to thee.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
