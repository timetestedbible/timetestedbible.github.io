and they shall be to thee seven weeks of years, nine and forty years.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall make a proclamation with the sound of a trumpet in all your land; on the day of atonement ye shall make a proclamation with a trumpet in all your land.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And ye shall sanctify the year, the fiftieth year, and ye shall proclaim a release upon the land to all that inhabit it; it shall be given a year of release, a jubilee for you; and each one shall depart to his possession, and ye shall go each to his family.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>This is a jubilee of release, the year shall be to you the fiftieth year: ye shall not sow, nor reap the produce that comes of itself from the land, neither shall ye gather its dedicated fruits.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For it is a jubilee of release; it shall be holy to you, ye shall eat its fruits off the fields.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In the year of the release <span class='add'>even</span> the jubilee of it, shall <span class='add'>each</span> one return to his possession.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And if thou shouldest sell a possession to thy neighbor, or if thou shouldest buy of thy neighbor, let not a man oppress his neighbor.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>According to the number of years after the jubilee shalt thou buy of thy neighbor, according to the number of years of the fruits shall he sell to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>According as <span class='add'>there may be</span> a greater number of years he shall increase <span class='add'>the value of</span> his possession, and according as <span class='add'>there may be</span> a less number of years he shall lessen <span class='add'>the value of</span> his possession; for according to the number of his crops, so shall he sell to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let not a man oppress his neighbor, and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God: I am the Lord thy God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments;

for the land is mine, because ye are strangers and sojourners before me.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And in every land of your possession, ye shall allow ransoms for the land.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if thy brother who is with thee be poor, and should have sold <span class='add'>part</span> of his possession, and his kinsman who is nigh to him come, then he shall redeem the possession which his brother has sold.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And if one have no near kinsman, and he prosper with his hand, and he find sufficient money, <span class='add'>even</span> his ransom;

because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession in the midst of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the lands set apart for their cities shall not be sold, because this is their perpetual possession.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And if thy brother who is with thee become poor, and he fail in resources with thee, thou shalt help him as a stranger and a sojourner, and thy brother shall live with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thou shalt not receive from him interest, nor increase: and thou shalt fear thy God: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord: and thy brother shall live with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thou shalt not lend thy money to him at interest, and thou shalt not lend thy meat to him to be returned with increase.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, so as to be your God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And if thy brother by thee be lowered, and be sold to thee, he shall not serve thee with the servitude of a slave.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>He shall be with thee as a hireling or a sojourner, he shall work for thee till the year of release:   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>and he shall go out in the release, and his children with him;
