<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 24</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shiloh, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, <span class='add'>even</span> Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river, and I guided him through all the land, and I multiplied his seed;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau Mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I smote Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And afterward <span class='add'>God</span> brought out our fathers from Egypt, and ye entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and ye were in the wilderness many days.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that dwelt beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and ye inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Balak, king of Moab, son of Zippor, rose up, and made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But the Lord thy God would not destroy thee; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them <span class='add'>to us</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And ye crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, <span class='add'>even</span> twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he gave you a land on which ye did not labor, and cities which ye did not build, and ye were settled in them; and ye eat <span class='add'>of</span> vineyards and olive yards which ye did not plant.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom ye dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations through whom we passed.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yea, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, Indeed ye will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whensoever ye shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, because he has done you good.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will hearken to his voice.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Shiloh before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the oak before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this <span class='add'>stone</span> shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever ye shall deal falsely with the Lord my God.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Nun the servant of the Lord died, <span class='add'>at the age</span> of a hundred and ten years.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Timnath-serah in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Gilead:   <span class="verse" id="V32">31a&#160;</span>there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Gilgal, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried <span class='add'>them</span> in Shechem, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Shechem for a hundred ewe lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it came to pass afterward that Eleazar the high priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which he gave him in Mount Ephraim.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">33a&#160;</span>In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinehas exercised the priest’s office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gibeah:   <span class="verse" id="V35">33b&#160;</span>but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshiped Astarte, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglon king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
