<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 8</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and his own house after twenty years, then King Solomon assembled all the elders of Israel in Zion, to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, this is Zion,   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>in the month of Ethanim.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the priests took up the ark,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and the tabernacle of testimony, and the holy furniture that was in the tabernacle of testimony.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the king and all Israel <span class='add'>were occupied</span> before the ark, sacrificing sheep <span class='add'>and</span> oxen, without number.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the priests bring in the ark into its place, into the oracle of the house, even into the holy of holies, under the wings of the cherubs.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For the cherubs spread out their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubs covered the ark and its holy things above.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the holy staffs projected, and the ends of the holy staffs appeared out of the holy places in front of the oracle, and were not seen without.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which Moses put <span class='add'>there</span> in Horeb, which <span class='add'>tables</span> the Lord made <span class='add'>as a covenant</span> with the children of Israel in their going forth from the land of Egypt.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the priests departed out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, because the glory of the Lord filled the house.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the king turned his face, and the king blessed all Israel (and the whole assembly of Israel stood):   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and he said, Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the Lord God of Israel today, who spoke by his mouth concerning David my father, and has fulfilled it with his hands, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>From the day that I brought out my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in <span class='add'>any</span> one tribe of Israel to build a house, so that my name should be there: but I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there, and I chose David to be over my people Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it was in the heart of my father to build a house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord said to David my father, Forasmuch as it came into thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it came upon thy heart.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that has proceeded out of thy bowels, he shall build the house to my name.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord has confirmed the word that he spoke, and I am risen up in the place of my father David, and I have sat down on the throne of Israel, as the Lord spoke, and I have built the house to the name of the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord, which the Lord made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Solomon stood up in front of the altar before all the congregation of Israel; and he spread out his hands toward heaven:   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and he said, Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven above and on the earth beneath, keeping covenant and mercy with thy servant who walks before thee with all his heart;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>which thou hast kept toward thy servant David my father: for thou hast spoken by thy mouth and thou hast fulfilled it with thy hands, as <span class='add'>at</span> this day.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now, O Lord God of Israel, keep for thy servant David my father, <span class='add'>the promises</span> which thou hast spoken to him, saying, There shall not be taken from thee a man sitting before me on the throne of Israel, provided only thy children shall take heed to their ways, to walk before me as thou hast walked before me.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And now, O Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word to David my father be confirmed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, how much less even this house which I have built to thy name?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Yet, O Lord God of Israel, thou shalt look upon my petition, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays to thee in thy presence this day,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that thine eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which thou saidst, My name shall be there, to hear the prayer which thy servant prays at this place day and night.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And thou shalt hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall pray toward this place; and thou shalt hear in thy dwelling place in heaven, and thou shalt do and be gracious.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Whatsoever trespasses anyone shall commit against his neighbor—and if he shall take upon him an oath so that he should swear, and he shall come and make confession before thine altar in this house,   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear from heaven, and do, and thou shalt judge thy people Israel, that the wicked should be condemned, to recompense his way upon his head; and to justify the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>When thy people Israel falls before enemies, because they shall sin against thee, and they shall return and confess to thy name, and they shall pray and supplicate in this house,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear from heaven, and be gracious to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to their fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>When the heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall sin against thee, and they shall pray toward this place, and shall make confession to thy name, and shall turn from their sins when thou shalt have humbled them,   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>then thou shalt hear from heaven, and be merciful to the sins of thy servant and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt show them the good way to walk in it, and thou shalt give rain upon the earth which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>If there should be famine, if there should be death, because there should be blasting, locust, or if there be mildew, and if their enemy oppress them in anyone of their cities, <span class='add'>with regard to</span> every calamity, every trouble,   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>every prayer, every supplication whatever shall be made by any man, as they shall know each the plague of his heart, and shall spread abroad his hands to this house,   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>then shalt thou hearken from heaven, out of thine established dwelling place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt do, and recompense to <span class='add'>every</span> man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart, for thou alone knowest the heart of all the children of men:   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>that they may fear thee all the days that they live upon the land, which thou hast given to our fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And for the stranger who is not of thy people,   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>when they shall come and pray toward this place,   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear <span class='add'>them</span> from heaven, out of thine established dwelling place, and thou shalt do according to all that the stranger shall call upon thee for, that all the nations may know thy name, and fear thee, as <span class='add'>do</span> thy people Israel, and may know that thy name has been called on this house which I have built.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span><span class='add'>If it be</span> that thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way by which thou shalt turn them, and pray in the name of the Lord toward the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name,   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear from heaven their supplication and their prayer, and shalt execute judgment for them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span><span class='add'>If it be</span> that they shall sin against thee (for there is not a man who will not sin), and thou shalt bring them and deliver them up before their enemies, and they that take <span class='add'>them</span> captive shall carry <span class='add'>them</span> to a land far or near,   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>and they shall turn their hearts in the land whither they have been carried captives, and turn in the land of their sojourning, and supplicate thee, saying, We have sinned, we have done unjustly, we have transgressed,   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>and they shall turn to thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies whither thou hast carried them captives, and shall pray to thee toward their land which thou hast given to their fathers, and the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built to thy name:   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear from heaven thine established dwelling place,   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>and thou shalt be merciful to their unrighteousness wherein they have trespassed against thee, and according to all their transgressions wherewith they have transgressed against thee, and thou shalt cause them to be pitied before them that carried them captives, and they shall have compassion on them:   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>for <span class='add'>they are</span> thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, out of the midst of the furnace of iron.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And let thine eyes and thine ears be opened to the supplication of thy servant, and to the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken to them in all things for which they shall call upon thee.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Because thou hast set them apart for an inheritance to thyself out of all the nations of the earth, as thou spokest by the hand of thy servant Moses, when thou broughtest our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord God.   <span class="verse" id="V54">53a&#160;</span>Then spoke Solomon concerning the house, when he had finished building it—  </div><div class='q'>He manifested the sun in the heaven:  </div><div class='q'>The Lord said he would dwell in darkness:  </div><div class='q'>Build thou my house, a beautiful house  </div><div class='q'>For thyself to dwell in anew.  </div><div class='m'>Behold, is not this written in the book of the song?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Solomon had finished praying to the Lord all this prayer and supplication, that he rose up from before the altar of the Lord, <span class='add'>after</span> having knelt upon his knees, and his hands <span class='add'>were</span> spread out toward heaven.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Blessed <span class='add'>be</span> the Lord this day, who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he said: there has not failed one word among all his good words which he spoke by the hand of his servant Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>May the Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers; let him not desert us nor turn from us,   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>that he may turn our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways, and to keep all his commandments, and his ordinances which he commanded our fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And let these words, which I have prayed before the Lord our God, <span class='add'>be</span> near to the Lord our God day and night, to maintain the cause of thy servant, and the cause of thy people Israel forever.   <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>That all the nations of the earth may know that the Lord God, he <span class='add'>is</span> God, and there is none beside.   <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And let our hearts be perfect toward the Lord our God, to walk also holily in his ordinances, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And the king and all the children of Israel offered sacrifice before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And King Solomon offered for the sacrifices of peace offering which he sacrificed to the Lord, two and twenty thousand oxen, a hundred and twenty thousand sheep: and the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>In that day the king consecrated the middle of the court in the front of the house of the Lord; for there he offered the whole burnt offering, and the sacrifices, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which was before the Lord <span class='add'>was too</span> little to bear the whole burnt offering and the sacrifices of peace offerings.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>And Solomon kept the feast in that day, and all Israel with him, even a great assembly from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the Lord our God in the house which he built, eating and drinking, and rejoicing before the Lord our God seven days.   <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>And on the eighth day he sent away the people: and they blessed the king, and each departed to his tabernacle rejoicing, and <span class='add'>their</span> heart <span class='add'>was</span> glad because of the good things which the Lord had done to his servant David, and to Israel his people.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
