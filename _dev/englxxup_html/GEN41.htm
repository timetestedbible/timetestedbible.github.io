<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 41</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass after two full years that Pharaoh had a dream. He thought he stood upon <span class='add'>the bank of</span> the river.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And lo, there came up as it were out of the river seven cows, fair in appearance, and choice of flesh, and they fed on the sedge.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And other seven cows came up after these out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and fed by the <span class='add'>other</span> cows on the bank of the river.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the seven ill-favored and lean cows devoured the seven well-favored and choice-fleshed cows; and Pharaoh awoke.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he dreamed again. And, behold, seven ears came up on one stalk, choice and good.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And, behold, seven ears thin and blasted with the wind, grew up after them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the seven thin ears and blasted with the wind devoured the seven choice and full ears; and Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it was morning, and his soul was troubled; and he sent and called all the interpreters of Egypt, and all her wise men; and Pharaoh related to them his dream, and there was no one to interpret it to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I this day remember my fault:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And we had a dream both in one night, I and he; we saw, each according to his dream.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard; and we related to him <span class='add'>our dreams</span>, and he interpreted <span class='add'>them</span> to us.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, as he interpreted them to us, so also it happened, both that I was restored to my office, and that he was hanged.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Pharaoh having sent, called Joseph; and they brought him out from the prison, and shaved him, and changed his dress, and he came to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have seen a vision, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have heard say concerning thee that thou didst hear dreams and interpret them.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Joseph answered Pharaoh and said, Without God an answer of safety shall not be given to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, In my dream methought I stood by the bank of the river;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and there came up as it were out of the river, seven cows well-favored and choice-fleshed, and they fed on the sedge.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And behold seven other cows came up after them out of the river, evil and ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such that I never saw worse in all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the seven ill-favored and thin cows ate up the seven first good and choice cows.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they went into their bellies; and it was not perceptible that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance was ill-favored, as also at the beginning; and after I awoke I slept,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears came up on one stem, full and good.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And other seven ears, thin and blasted with the wind, sprang up close to them.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the seven thin and blasted ears devoured the seven fine and full ears: so I spoke to the interpreters, and there was no one to explain it to me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; whatever God does, he has shown to Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream of Pharaoh is one.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the seven thin kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven thin and blasted ears are seven years; there shall be seven years of famine.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And as for the word which I have told Pharaoh, whatsoever God intends to do, he has shown to Pharaoh:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>behold, for seven years there is coming great plenty in all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But there shall come seven years of famine after these, and they shall forget the plenty that shall be in all Egypt, and the famine shall consume the land.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of the famine that shall be after this, for it shall be very grievous.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And concerning the repetition of the dream to Pharaoh twice, <span class='add'>it is</span> because the saying which is from God shall be true, and God will hasten to accomplish it.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Now then, look out a wise and prudent man, and set him over the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And let Pharaoh make and appoint local governors over the land; and let them take up a fifth part of all the produce of the land of Egypt for the seven years of the plenty.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And let them gather all the food of these seven good years that are coming, and let the corn be gathered under the hand of Pharaoh; let food be kept in the cities.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the stored food shall be for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be utterly destroyed by the famine.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And the word was pleasing in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of all his servants.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to all his servants, Shall we find such a man as this, who has the Spirit of God in him?   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Since God has shown thee all these things, there is not a wiser or more prudent man than thou.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Thou shalt be over my house, and all my people shall be obedient to thy word; only in the throne will I excel thee.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Behold, I set thee this day over all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Pharaoh took his ring off his hand, and put it on the hand of Joseph, and put on him a robe of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold about his neck.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And he mounted him on the second of his chariots, and a herald made proclamation before him; and he set him over all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; without thee no one shall lift up his hand on all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And Pharaoh called the name of Joseph, Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And the land produced, in the seven years of plenty, <span class='add'>whole</span> handfuls <span class='add'>of corn</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he gathered all the food of the seven years, in which was the plenty in the land of Egypt; and he laid up the food in the cities; the food of the fields of a city round about it he laid up in it.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And Joseph gathered very much corn as the sand of the sea, until it could not be numbered, for there was no number <span class='add'>of it</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And to Joseph were born two sons, before the seven years of famine came, which Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn, Manasseh; For God, <span class='add'>said he</span>, has made me forget all my toils, and all my father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And he called the name of the second, Ephraim; For God, <span class='add'>said he</span>, has increased me in the land of my humiliation.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And the seven years of plenty passed away, which were in the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph said; and there was a famine in all the land; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And all the land of Egypt was hungry; and the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph, and do whatsoever he shall tell you.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>And the famine was on the face of all the earth; and Joseph opened all the granaries, and sold to all the Egyptians.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And all countries came to Egypt to buy of Joseph, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
