<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had taken Ai, and had destroyed it, as he did to Jericho and its king, even so they did to Ai and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had gone over to Joshua and Israel;   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>then they were greatly terrified by them, for <span class='add'>the king</span> knew that Gibeon <span class='add'>was</span> a great city, as one of the chief cities, and all its men <span class='add'>were</span> mighty.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Elam king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Adullam, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Come up hither to me, and help me, and let us take Gibeon; for the Gibeonites have gone over to Joshua and to the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the five kings of the Jebusites went up, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam, they and all their people; and encamped around Gibeon, and besieged it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the inhabitants of Gibeon sent to Joshua into the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants: come up quickly to us, and help us, and rescue us; for all the kings of the Amorites who dwell in the hill country are gathered together against us.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, every one mighty in strength.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear them not, for I have delivered them into thy hands; there shall not one of them be left before you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when Joshua came suddenly upon them, he <span class='add'>had</span> advanced all the night out of Gilgal.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord struck them with terror before the children of Israel; and the Lord destroyed them with a great slaughter at Gibeon; and they pursued them by the way of the going up of Horon, and they smote them to Azekah and to Makkedah.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And when they fled from the face of the children of Israel at the descent of Horon, then the Lord cast upon them hailstones from heaven to Azekah; and they were more that died by the hailstones, than those whom the children of Israel slew with the sword in the battle.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Joshua spoke to the Lord, in the day in which the Lord delivered the Amorite into the power of Israel, when he destroyed them in Gibeon, and they were destroyed from before the children of Israel: and Joshua said,  </div><div class='q'>Let the sun stand over against Gibeon,  </div><div class='q'>And the moon over against the Valley of Aijalon.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the sun and the moon stood still,  </div><div class='q'>Until God executed vengeance on their enemies;  </div><div class='m'>and the sun stood still in the midst of heaven; it did not proceed to set till the end of one day.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And there was not such a day either before or after, so that God should hearken to a man, because the Lord fought on the side of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave that is in Makkedah.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found hidden in the cave that is in Makkedah.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Joshua said, Roll stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men to watch over them.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But do not ye stand, but pursue after your enemies, and attack the rear of them, and do not suffer them to enter into their cities; for the Lord our God has delivered them into our hands.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Joshua and all Israel ceased destroying them utterly with a very great slaughter, that they that escaped took refuge in the strong cities.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all the people returned safe to Joshua to Makkedah; and no one of the children of Israel murmured with his tongue.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Joshua said, Open the cave, and bring out these five kings out of the cave.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they brought out the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, and the king of Hebron, and the king of Jarmuth, and the king of Lachish, and the king of Adullam.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And when they brought them out to Joshua, then Joshua called together all Israel, and the chiefs of the army that went with him, saying to them, Come forward and set your feet on their necks; and they came and set their feet on their necks.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Joshua said to them, Do not fear them, neither be cowardly; be courageous and strong, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies, against whom ye fight.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Joshua slew them, and hanged them on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass toward the setting of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and cast them into the cave into which they <span class='add'>had</span> fled for refuge, and rolled stones to the cave, <span class='add'>which remain</span> till this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they took Makkedah on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and they utterly destroyed every living thing that was in it; and there was none left in it that was preserved and had escaped; and they did to the king of Makkedah, as they did to the king of Jericho.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel with him departed out of Makkedah to Libnah, and besieged Libnah.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the Lord delivered it into the hands of Israel: and they took it, and its king, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and everything breathing in it; and there was not left in it any that survived and escaped; and they did to its king, as they did to the king of Jericho.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Libnah to Lachish, and he encamped about it, and besieged it.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Lord delivered Lachish into the hands of Israel; and they took it on the second day, and they put the inhabitants to death with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed it, as they had done to Libnah.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Elam the king of Gezer went up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people with the edge of the sword, until there was not left to him one that was preserved and escaped.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel with him departed from Lachish to Adullam, and he besieged it and took it.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord delivered it into the hand of Israel; and he took it on that day, and slew the inhabitants with the edge of the sword, and slew everything breathing in it, as they did to Lachish.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel with him departed to Hebron, and encamped about it.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the living creatures that were in it; there was no one preserved: they destroyed it and all things in it, as they did to Adullam.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Joshua and all Israel returned to Debir; and they encamped about it;   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>and they took it, and its king, and its villages: and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and they destroyed it, and everything breathing in it; and they did not leave in it anyone that was preserved: as they did to Hebron and her king, so they did to Debir and her king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And Joshua smote all the land of the hill country, and Negeb and the plain country, and Asedoth, and her kings, they did not leave of them one that was saved: and they utterly destroyed everything that had the breath of life, as the Lord God of Israel commanded,   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, all Goshen, as far as Gibeon.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Joshua smote, once for all, all their kings, and their land, because the Lord God of Israel fought on the side of Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
