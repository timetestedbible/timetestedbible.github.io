Because of the abundance of thine iniquity have thy skirts been discovered, that thy heels might be exposed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>If the Ethiopian shall change his skin, or the leopardess her spots, then shall ye be able to do good, having learned evil.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So I scattered them as sticks carried by the wind into the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thus is thy lot, and the reward of your disobedience to me, saith the Lord; as thou didst forget me, and trust in lies,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I also will expose thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall be seen;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>thine adultery also, and thy neighing, and the looseness of thy fornication: on the hills and in the fields I have seen thine abominations.
