And he said, Thy servant <span class='add'>is</span> of one of the tribes of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Absalom said to him, See, thy affairs <span class='add'>are</span> right and clear, yet thou hast no one <span class='add'>appointed</span> of the king to hear thee.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Absalom said, O that one would make me a judge in the land; then every man who had a dispute or a cause would come to me, and I would judge him!   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And it came to pass when a man came near to do him obeisance, that he stretched out his hand, and took hold of him, and kissed him.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Absalom did after this manner to all Israel that came to the king for judgment; and Absalom gained the hearts of the men of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to his father, I will go now, and pay my vows, which I vowed to the Lord in Hebron.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For thy servant vowed a vow when I dwelt at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the Lord should indeed restore me to Jerusalem, then will I serve the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the king said to him, Go in peace. And he arose and went to Hebron.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, When ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then shall ye say, Absalom is become king in Hebron.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there went with Absalom two hundred chosen men from Jerusalem; and they went in their simplicity, and knew not anything.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Absalom sent to Ahithophel the Theconite, the counselor of David, from his city, from Giloh, where he was sacrificing: and there was a strong conspiracy; and the people with Absalom were increasingly numerous.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And there came a messenger to David, saying, The heart of the men of Israel is gone after Absalom.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem, Rise, and let us flee, for we have no refuge from Absalom: make haste and go, lest he overtake us speedily, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the king’s servants said to the king, In all things which our lord the king chooses, behold <span class='add'>we are</span> thy servants.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the king and all his house went out on foot: and the king left ten women of his concubines to keep the house.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king and all his servants went out on foot; and abode in a distant house.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And all his servants passed on by his side, and every Cherethite, and every Pelethite, and they stood by the olive tree in the wilderness: and all the people marched near him, and all his court, and all the men of might, and all the men of war, six hundred: and they were present at his side: and every Cherethite, and every Pelethite, and all the six hundred Gittites that came on foot out of Gath, and they went on before the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the king said to Ittai the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? return, and dwell with the king, for thou art a stranger, and thou hast come forth as a sojourner out of thy place.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Whereas thou camest yesterday, shall I today cause thee to travel with us, and shalt thou <span class='add'>thus</span> change thy place? thou didst come forth yesterday, and today shall I set thee in motion to go along with us? I indeed will go whithersoever I may go: return then, and cause thy brethren to return with thee, and may the Lord deal mercifully and truly with thee.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ittai answered the king and said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and as my lord the king lives, in the place wheresoever my lord shall be, whether it be for death or life, there shall thy servant be.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the king said to Ittai, Come and pass over with me. So Ittai the Gittite and the king passed over, and all his servants, and all the multitude with him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And all the country wept with a loud voice. And all the people passed by over the brook of Kidron; and the king crossed the brook Kidron: and all the people and the king passed on toward the way of the wilderness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And behold also Zadok, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Baethar: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had passed out of the city.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I should find favor in the eyes of the Lord, then will he bring me back, and he will show me it and its beauty.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But if he should say thus, I have no pleasure in thee; behold, <span class='add'>here</span> I am, let him do to me according to that which is good in his eyes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king said to Zadok the priest, Behold, thou shalt return to the city in peace, and Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons with you.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Behold, I continue in arms in Araboth of the desert, until there come tidings from you to report to me.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So Zadok and Abiathar brought back the ark of the Lord to Jerusalem, and it continued there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And David went up by the ascent of <span class='add'>the mount of</span> Olives, ascending and weeping, and had his head covered, and went barefooted: and all the people that were with him covered <span class='add'>every</span> man his head; and they went up, ascending and weeping.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it was reported to David, saying, Ahithophel also <span class='add'>is</span> among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O Lord my God, disconcert, I pray thee, the counsel of Ahithophel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And David came as far as Ros, where he worshiped God: and behold, Hushai the chief friend of David came out to meet him, having rent his garment, and earth <span class='add'>was</span> upon his head.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And David said to him, If thou shouldest go over with me, then wilt thou be a burden to me;   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>but if thou shall return to the city, and shalt say to Absalom, Thy brethren are passed over, and the king thy father is passed over after me: and now I am thy servant, O king, suffer me to live: at one time even of late I was the servant of thy father, and now I <span class='add'>am</span> thy humble servant—so shalt thou disconcert for me the counsel of Ahithophel.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And, behold, <span class='add'>there are</span> there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests; and it shall be that every word that thou shalt hear of the house of the king, thou shalt report it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Behold, <span class='add'>there are</span> there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar; and by them ye shall report to me every word which ye shall hear.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>So Hushai the friend of David went into the city, and Absalom was lately gone into Jerusalem.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
