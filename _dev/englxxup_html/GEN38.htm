  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from my flock; and she said, <span class='add'>Well</span>, if thou wilt give me an earnest, until thou send it.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said, What is the earnest that I shall give thee? and she said, Thy ring, and thy bracelet, and the staff in thy hand; and he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And she arose and departed, and took her veil from off her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman; and he found her not.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he asked the men of the place, Where is the harlot who was in Enaim by the wayside? and they said, There was no harlot here.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the place say, There is no harlot here.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Judah said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this kid, but thou hast not found her.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass after three months, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has grievously played the harlot, and behold she is with child by whoredom; and Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burned.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And as they were bringing her, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Judah knew <span class='add'>them</span>, and said, Tamar is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he knew her not again.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass when she was in labor, that she also had twins in her womb.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And it came to pass as she was bringing forth, one thrust forth his hand, and the midwife having taken hold of it, bound upon his hand a scarlet <span class='add'>thread</span>, saying, This one shall come out first.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And when he drew back his hand, then immediately came forth his brother; and she said, Why has the barrier been cut through because of thee? and she called his name, Perez.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And after this came forth his brother, on whose hand was the scarlet thread; and she called his name, Zerah.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
