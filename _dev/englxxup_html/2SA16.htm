And Ziba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in thine eyes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And King David came to Bahurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Shimei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of King David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And thus Shimei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, thou bloody man, and man of sin.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, because thou hast reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou <span class='add'>art taken</span> in thy mischief, because thou <span class='add'>art</span> a bloody man.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why hast thou done thus?   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David said to Abishai and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Shimei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Absalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Hushai the chief friend of David came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, Let the king live.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Absalom said to Hushai, <span class='add'>Is</span> this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not forth with thy friend?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Hushai said to Absalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen—his will I be, and with him will I dwell.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of thy father, so will I be in thy presence.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Absalom said to Ahithophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to thy father’s concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that thou hast dishonored thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counseled in former days, <span class='add'>was</span> as if one should inquire of the word of God: so <span class='add'>was</span> all the counsel of Ahithophel both to David and also to Absalom.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
