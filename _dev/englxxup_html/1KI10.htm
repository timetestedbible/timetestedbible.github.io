and <span class='add'>there came</span> camels bearing spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and she came in to Solomon, and told him all that was in her heart.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Solomon answered all her questions: and there was not a question overlooked by the king which he did not answer her.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon, and the house which he built,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and the provision of Solomon and the sitting of his attendants, and the standing of his servants, and his raiment, and his cupbearers, and his whole burnt offering which he offered in the house of the Lord, and she was utterly amazed.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And she said to King Solomon, <span class='add'>It was</span> a true report which I heard in my land of thy words and thy wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But I believed not them that told me, until I came and my eyes saw: and, behold, the words as they reported to me are not the half: thou hast exceeded in goodness all the report which I heard in my land.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Blessed <span class='add'>are</span> thy wives, blessed <span class='add'>are</span> these thy servants who stand before thee continually, who hear all thy wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord thy God, who has taken pleasure in thee, to set thee upon the throne of Israel, because the Lord loved Israel to establish <span class='add'>him</span> forever; and he has made thee king over them, to execute judgment with justice, and in their causes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And she gave to Solomon a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and very many spices, and precious stones: there had not come any other spices so abundant as those which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the ship of Hiram which brought the gold from Ophir, brought very much hewn timber and precious stones.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king made the hewn timber <span class='add'>into</span> buttresses of the house of the Lord and the king’s house, and lyres and harps for singers: such hewn timber had not come upon the earth, nor have been seen anywhere until this day.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatsoever she asked, besides all that he had given her by the hand of King Solomon: and she returned, and came into her own land, she and her servants.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Besides the tributes of them that were subjects, both merchants and all the kings of the <span class='add'>country</span> beyond <span class='add'>the river</span>, and of the princes of the land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Solomon made three hundred spears of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold were upon one spear.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And three hundred shields of beaten gold: and three pounds of gold were in one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the king made a great ivory throne, and gilded it with pure gold.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The throne <span class='add'>had</span> six steps, and calves in bold relief to the throne behind it, and side pieces on either hand of the place of the seat, and two lions standing by the side pieces,   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and twelve lions standing there on the six steps on either side: it was not so done in any <span class='add'>other</span> kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all the vessels made by Solomon <span class='add'>were</span> of gold, and the lavers <span class='add'>were</span> golden, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; there was no silver, for it was not accounted of in the days of Solomon.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For Solomon had a ship of Tarshish in the sea with the ships of Hiram: one ship came to the king every three years out of Tarshish, <span class='add'>laden with</span> gold and silver, and wrought stones, and hewn stones.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">22a&#160;</span>This was the arrangement of the provision which King Solomon fetched to build the house of the Lord, and the house of the king, and the wall of Jerusalem, and the citadel; to fortify the city of David, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer, and Beth-horon the upper, and Jethermath, and all the cities of the chariots, and all the cities of the horsemen, and the fortification of Solomon which he purposed to build in Jerusalem and in all the land,   <span class="verse" id="V24">22b&#160;</span>so that none of the people should rule over him that was left of the Hittite and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, who were not of the children of Israel, their descendants who had been left with him in the land, whom the children of Israel could not utterly destroy; and Solomon made them tributaries until this day.   <span class="verse" id="V25">22c&#160;</span>But of the children of Israel Solomon made nothing; for they were the warriors, and his servants and rulers, and captains of the third order, and the captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Solomon increased beyond all the kings of the earth in wealth and wisdom.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom which the Lord <span class='add'>had</span> put into his heart.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they brought every one their gifts, vessels of gold, and raiment, and stacte, and spices, and horses, and mules, a rate year by year.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Solomon had four thousand mares for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he put them in the cities of his chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem:   <span class="verse" id="V27">26a&#160;</span>and he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the Philistines, and to the borders of Egypt.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king made gold and silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars as the sycamores in the plain for multitude.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the goings forth of Solomon’s horsemen <span class='add'>was</span> also out of Egypt, and the king’s merchants <span class='add'>were</span> of Kue; and they received them out of Kue at a price.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And that which proceeded out of Egypt went up <span class='add'>thus, even</span> a chariot for a hundred <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver, and a horse for fifty <span class='add'>shekels</span> of silver: and thus for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they came out by sea.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
