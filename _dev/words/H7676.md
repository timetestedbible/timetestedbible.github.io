## Summary

The word *shabbath* (שַבָּת) derives from the verb *shabath* (שָׁבַת, H7673) meaning "to cease, to rest, to desist from exertion." The noun form intensifies this concept, referring to **the completion, end, and rest of a unit of work**. Scripture consistently defines Sabbath as a **6+1 structure**: six days of work followed by one day of rest. However, Sabbath is far more than just a calendar day—it represents a **week-long structure**, a **sign** between God and His people, an **appointed time** (mo'ed), and a **holy space-time** that exists objectively in creation.

## Root: שָׁבַת (shabath, H7673)

**Definition:** "To repose, i.e. desist from exertion; used in many implied relations (causative, figurative or specific)"

The verb root means "to cease, to rest, to stop working." It describes the completion of a work cycle, not merely inactivity, but the intentional cessation that marks the end of a completed unit of labor.

---

## The 6+1 Structure: Consistently Defined

Scripture repeatedly establishes Sabbath as **six days of work + one day of rest**:

### Genesis 2:2-3 (Creation Pattern)
> "And on the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation."

**Pattern:** Six days of creation work → Seventh day of rest → Blessed and made holy

### Exodus 20:8-11 (The Command)
> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. **Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath** to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work... For **in six days** the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and **rested on the seventh day**. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

**Pattern:** Six days work → Seventh day Sabbath → No work → Pattern mirrors creation

### Exodus 16:22-30 (Manna Pattern)
> "On the **sixth day** they gathered twice as much bread... And Moses said, 'Eat it today, for today is a **Sabbath to the LORD**; today you will not find it in the field. **Six days** you shall gather it, but on the **seventh day**, which is a **Sabbath**, there will be none.'"

**Pattern:** Six days gathering → Seventh day Sabbath → No gathering → Double portion on sixth day

### Leviticus 23:3 (Appointed Time)
> "**Six days** shall work be done, but on the **seventh day** is a **Sabbath** of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwelling places."

**Pattern:** Six days work → Seventh day Sabbath → Holy convocation → No work

**Conclusion:** Every scriptural definition of Sabbath follows the **6+1 pattern**—six days of work completed, then one day of rest marking the completion of that work unit.

## Sabbath as More Than a Calendar Day

### 1. "Sabbath Day" Can Mean "Sabbath Week"

The Hebrew word *yom* (יוֹם, H3117), typically translated as "day," has a flexible semantic range that includes:
- Daylight (as opposed to night)
- A 24-hour period
- An abstract division of time, or a period of time
- A year
- A lifetime

Because of this flexibility, references to the **"Sabbath Day"** can inherently mean the **"Sabbath Week"** (the entire 6+1 unit). When Scripture says "the Sabbath day," it may refer to:
- The seventh day of rest specifically, OR
- The entire week structure (six days of work + one day of rest)

This linguistic flexibility means that "Sabbath Day" and "Sabbath Week" are not mutually exclusive terms—the same phrase can refer to both the day of rest and the complete week unit, depending on context.

### 2. Sabbath as a Week Structure

Scripture explicitly uses "Sabbath" to refer to the **entire week** (the 6+1 unit), not just the rest day:

#### Leviticus 23:15-16 (Counting Weeks)
> "And you shall count for yourselves **from the day after the sabbath**, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, **seven full weeks** (sheva shabbatot) shall they be. You shall count **fifty days until the day after the seventh week** (shabbat), and you shall present a grain offering of new grain to the LORD."

**Key:** "Seven full weeks" uses the plural of "Sabbath" (*shabbatot*), meaning "seven complete Sabbath-weeks." The text counts **weeks** (Sabbath units), not individual days.

#### Isaiah 66:23 (Monthly Structure)
> "From new moon to new moon, and **from Sabbath to Sabbath**, all flesh shall come to worship before me, declares the LORD."

**Structure:** Months are divided into "Sabbaths" (weeks), showing Sabbath as a **time unit** within the month.

### 3. Sabbath as a Sign

Sabbath functions as a **sign** identifying God's people and His covenant:

#### Exodus 31:13, 16-17
> "You are to speak to the people of Israel and say, 'Above all you shall **keep my Sabbaths, for this is a sign** between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I, the LORD, sanctify you.'... Therefore the people of Israel shall **keep the Sabbath**, observing the Sabbath throughout their generations, as a perpetual covenant. **It is a sign forever** between me and the people of Israel that in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed."

#### Ezekiel 20:12, 20
> "Moreover, I gave them **my Sabbaths, as a sign** between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD who sanctifies them... And keep **my Sabbaths holy** and make them holy, that **they may be a sign** between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God."

**Function:** Sabbath is a **visible marker** that distinguishes God's people from the world—a sign of covenant relationship and sanctification.

### 4. Sabbath as an Appointed Time (Mo'ed)

Sabbath is classified as one of God's **appointed times** (mo'edim):

#### Leviticus 23:2-3
> "Speak to the people of Israel and say to them, **These are the appointed feasts** [mo'adei] of the LORD that you shall proclaim as holy convocations; **they are my appointed feasts** [mo'adai]. **Six days** shall work be done, but on the **seventh day** is a **Sabbath** of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. **It is a Sabbath** to the LORD in all your dwelling places."

**Connection:** Sabbath is listed alongside Passover, First Fruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacles as an **appointed time**—a fixed, holy meeting time with God.

#### Genesis 1:14 (Heavenly Lights)
> "And God said, 'Let there be **lights in the vault of the sky** to separate the day from the night, and **let them serve as signs to mark sacred times** [mo'edim], and days and years.'"

**Implication:** The sun, moon, and stars mark appointed times. Sabbath qualifies as a **sign**, an **appointed time**, and a type of **day**—fulfilling three of the four purposes of the heavenly lights.

### 5. Sabbath as Objective Space-Time

Sabbath exists as an **objective holy space-time**, not a subjective personal choice:

#### Ezekiel 46:1 (Temple Gate Pattern)
> "Thus says the Lord GOD: 'The gate of the inner courtyard facing east shall be **shut for the six working days**; but it shall be opened on the **Sabbath day** and opened on the **day of the renewed moon**.'"

**Classification:** Scripture distinguishes three types of days:
- **Working days** (six days)
- **Sabbath day** (seventh day)
- **New moon day** (first day of month)

The gate cannot be both open and shut simultaneously, showing these are **objective categories** that cannot overlap.

#### Pre-Creation Holiness
> "So God blessed the **seventh day** and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation." (Genesis 2:3)

**Implication:** The holiness of the seventh day **pre-dates** the command to observe it. God **declared** it holy at creation—it exists objectively, independent of human recognition or tradition.

## Key Verses Demonstrating the 6+1 Structure

### Exodus 20:8-11 (The Decalogue)
> "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. **Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath** to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For **in six days** the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and **rested on the seventh day**. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy."

**Structure:** 6 days work → 7th day Sabbath → Pattern established at creation

### Exodus 16:22-30 (Manna)
> "On the **sixth day** they gathered twice as much bread, two omers per person... And Moses said, 'Eat it today, for today is a **Sabbath to the LORD**; today you will not find it in the field. **Six days** you shall gather it, but on the **seventh day**, which is a **Sabbath**, there will be none.'"

**Structure:** 6 days gathering → 7th day Sabbath → No gathering → Preparation on 6th day

### Leviticus 23:3 (Appointed Times)
> "**Six days** shall work be done, but on the **seventh day** is a **Sabbath** of solemn rest, a holy convocation. You shall do no work. It is a Sabbath to the LORD in all your dwelling places."

**Structure:** 6 days work → 7th day Sabbath → Holy convocation → Universal observance

## Sabbath as Completion and Rest

The root verb *shabath* (H7673) means "to cease, to desist from exertion." This is not mere inactivity, but the **intentional cessation that marks completion**:

- **Work is finished** → Then rest begins
- **Six days completed** → Seventh day marks the completion
- **Unit of work done** → Sabbath celebrates the finished work

Sabbath represents the **end** of a work cycle, the **completion** of labor, and the **rest** that follows accomplishment. It is the **culmination** of the week, not an isolated day inserted into an ongoing cycle.

## Prophetic/Typological Extension: The Millennial Sabbath

Scripture reveals that the Sabbath pattern applies to multiple time scales. The weekly Sabbath (6+1 days) mirrors a larger pattern in God's plan:

### 2 Peter 3:8 (Time Scale Principle)
> "But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord **one day is as a thousand years**, and a thousand years as one day."

**Principle:** God's time scales are not limited to 24-hour periods. A "day" can represent a thousand-year period in prophetic context.

### The Creation Week Pattern
Just as God worked for **six days** and rested on the **seventh day** at creation, Scripture reveals a pattern where:
- **Six days** of creation work → **Seventh day** of rest
- **Six thousand years** of human history → **Seventh millennium** (1000-year reign) of rest

### Revelation 20:4-6 (The Millennial Reign)
> "Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed... They came to life and **reigned with Christ for a thousand years**... This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and **they will reign with him for a thousand years**."

**Pattern:** The millennial reign represents the **seventh millennium**—the Sabbath rest following six millennia of human history, completing the 6+1 pattern on a larger scale.

This typological extension shows Sabbath as a **structural principle** embedded in creation that applies across multiple time scales: weekly (6 days + 1 day) and millennial (6000 years + 1000 years).

## Conclusion

**H7676 (שַבָּת / shabbath) represents:**

1. **The completion, end, and rest of a unit of work** — derived from the verb "to cease, to rest"
2. **Consistently defined as 6+1** — six days of work followed by one day of rest, established at creation and repeated throughout Scripture
3. **Far more than a calendar day** — it is:
   - A **week structure** (the entire 6+1 unit)
   - A **sign** between God and His people
   - An **appointed time** (mo'ed) marked by heavenly lights
   - An **objective holy space-time** that exists independently of human tradition
   - A **structural principle** that applies to multiple time scales (weekly, millennial)

Sabbath is not merely "Saturday" or "the seventh day of a continuous cycle." It is a **divinely established pattern** embedded in creation: **work completed → rest that follows**. This pattern is objective, observable, and tied to the heavenly lights that mark signs, seasons, and appointed times.
