# Evidence Scoring Rubric

## Purpose
Objective, numerical evaluation of argument strength for scalable comparison of competing claims.

## Scoring Scale: 0-100 points

### PRIMARY EVIDENCE (0-60 points)

#### Astronomical/Physical Evidence (15-25 points)
- **25 points**: Precise, measurable, dramatic, visible
  - Example: Total lunar eclipse, blood-red, 1 hour 39 minutes, visible timing
- **20 points**: Precise, measurable, but less dramatic
  - Example: Total eclipse, but less visible or shorter duration
- **15 points**: Partial or faint, requires interpretation
  - Example: Partial eclipse at 3 AM, faint
- **10 points**: Indirect or approximate
  - Example: Astronomical alignment, approximate date

#### Explicit Historical Statements (15-20 points)
- **20 points**: Most emphatic, precise, unambiguous
  - Example: "27 years to the day", "on the very same day"
- **18 points**: Explicit and clear
  - Example: "He was about seventy when he died"
- **15 points**: Clear but less emphatic
  - Example: Standard historical statement
- **10 points**: Requires interpretation
  - Example: Ambiguous statement, multiple interpretations possible

#### Direct Calculations (10-15 points)
- **15 points**: Simple, direct, from explicit statements
  - Example: Age calculation (15 years old → 70 at death)
- **12 points**: Direct but requires one step
  - Example: Capture date + reign length
- **10 points**: Multiple steps or assumptions
  - Example: Complex calculation with intermediate steps

#### Cross-Validation (5-10 points)
- **10 points**: Strong cross-validation
  - Example: Regnal span test validates both capture and death dates
- **8 points**: Moderate cross-validation
  - Example: Two independent calculations converge
- **5 points**: Weak cross-validation
  - Example: Supporting evidence aligns

---

### SUPPORTING EVIDENCE (0-20 points)

#### Manuscript Evidence (10-15 points)
- **15 points**: Older (4th-8th century), unanimous, multiple origins
  - Example: All ~20 early Latin copies agree
- **12 points**: Older, unanimous, single origin
  - Example: Unanimous early manuscripts from one region
- **10 points**: Later (9th-10th century), majority
  - Example: Majority of Greek manuscripts
- **8 points**: Later, divided
  - Example: Some manuscripts support, others don't

#### Secondary Sources (5-10 points)
- **10 points**: Contemporary, reliable, explicit
  - Example: Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius
- **8 points**: Contemporary, reliable, but less explicit
  - Example: Dio Cassius, Appian
- **5 points**: Later or less reliable
  - Example: Later historians, traditions

---

### PENALTIES (-5 to -20 points each)

#### Special Pleading Required (-10 to -20 points)
- **-20 points**: Unprecedented, major assumption
  - Example: Zero-year ante-dating (never used for Herodian rulers)
- **-15 points**: Unprecedented, moderate assumption
  - Example: Non-standard regnal reckoning
- **-10 points**: Minor special pleading
  - Example: Slight adjustment to standard practice

#### Dismissing Explicit Statements (-10 to -15 points)
- **-15 points**: Dismissing most emphatic statement
  - Example: Ignoring "27 years to the day"
- **-12 points**: Dismissing explicit statement
  - Example: Ignoring "about seventy when he died"
- **-10 points**: Dismissing clear statement
  - Example: Ignoring standard historical statement

#### Ignoring Evidence (-5 to -10 points)
- **-10 points**: Ignoring major evidence line
  - Example: Not addressing age calculation
- **-8 points**: Ignoring moderate evidence
  - Example: Not addressing 107 high priests calculation
- **-5 points**: Ignoring minor evidence
  - Example: Not addressing secondary source

### BONUSES (+5 to +15 points)

#### Multiple Independent Lines (+10 to +15 points)
- **+15 points**: 4+ independent primary lines
- **+12 points**: 3 independent primary lines
- **+10 points**: 2 independent primary lines

#### Convergence (+5 to +10 points)
- **+10 points**: Different evidence types strongly converge
  - Example: Astronomical + historical + manuscript + calculation
- **+8 points**: Different evidence types moderately converge
  - Example: Historical + manuscript + calculation
- **+5 points**: Some convergence
  - Example: Two types of evidence agree

#### No Special Pleading (+5 points)
- Natural fit, no ad hoc adjustments required

## SCORING EXAMPLES

### Example 1: H13 (Herod's Death - 1 BC)
- **Primary Evidence** (60 points):
  - H5 (eclipse): 20 points (precise, dramatic, visible)
  - H11 (age): 15 points (direct calculation, explicit)
  - H12 (capture + reign): 15 points (explicit statement, precise)
  - H12g (regnal span): 10 points (cross-validation)
- **Supporting Evidence** (15 points):
  - H8b (Philip): 15 points (older, unanimous manuscripts)
- **Penalties** (-12 points):
  - H8a contradiction: -12 points (requires special pleading)
- **Bonuses** (+12 points):
  - Multiple independent lines: +10 (4 primary)
  - Convergence: +2 (astronomical + historical + manuscript)
- **Total**: 87/100

### Example 2: H13 Alternative (Herod's Death - 4 BC)
- **Primary Evidence** (25 points):
  - Eclipse: 15 points (partial, faint, 3 AM)
  - Greek MSS: 10 points (later, majority)
- **Supporting Evidence** (10 points):
  - Some secondary sources: 10 points
- **Penalties** (-28 points):
  - Zero-year ante-dating: -20 (unprecedented)
  - Dismissing "27 years to the day": -15 (most emphatic)
  - Ignoring age calculation: -10 (major evidence)
  - Ignoring 107 high priests: -8 (moderate evidence)
- **Bonuses** (+5 points):
  - Some convergence: +5
- **Total**: 42/100

## APPLICATION GUIDELINES

1. **Score each evidence line independently**
2. **Sum primary evidence** (max 60)
3. **Sum supporting evidence** (max 20)
4. **Apply penalties** (subtract)
5. **Apply bonuses** (add)
6. **Cap at 100 points** (if exceeds, indicates exceptional strength)
7. **Compare scores** to determine relative strength

---

## STRENGTH RATIOS

- **2:1 or higher**: Strongly favors one claim
- **1.5:1 to 2:1**: Moderately favors one claim
- **1.2:1 to 1.5:1**: Slightly favors one claim
- **1:1 to 1.2:1**: Roughly equal

---

## NOTES

- Scores are **relative**, not absolute
- Focus on **comparison** between competing claims
- **Transparency** is key - show calculation
- **Refinement** is expected as rubric is tested
- **Consistency** in application is critical
