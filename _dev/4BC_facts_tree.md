Fact Dependency Tree for "Consensus Chronology"
FOUNDATIONAL ASSUMPTIONS (No dependencies - these are axioms)
A1. Historical-Critical Method

Prioritize primary sources (Josephus, inscriptions, coins) over later interpretations
Use astronomical data (eclipses, calendars) to anchor dates
Inclusive counting for regnal years unless evidence suggests otherwise

A2. Manuscript Priority

Greek manuscripts of Josephus generally take precedence over Latin variants unless earlier attestation
Majority readings preferred without clear corruption
Textual variants evaluated based on age, unanimity, and consistency with external evidence

A3. Lunar Calendar Principles

Months begin at first visible crescent (new moon sighting)
Weeks are continuous 7-day cycles, independent of lunar phases
Accessibility through observation, not requiring modern tools

A4. Celestial Signs

Sun, moon for seasons, festivals, years (Gen 1:14)
But weekly cycle not tied to moon; Sabbath fixed every 7th day

A5. Prophetic Interpretation

Daniel 9:24-27 interpreted historically or symbolically, not requiring exact 490-year literal fulfillment to specific events
Multiple decrees contribute to restoration; no single "the" decree


LEVEL 1: INDEPENDENT HISTORICAL FACTS (Verified from external sources)
H1. Pompey's Capture of Jerusalem

Fact: 63 BC, third month (Sivan), on a fast day
Source: Josephus (Ant. 14.4.3-4); unanimous ancient historians
Dependencies: None
Confidence: Very High

H2. Roman Consular Dating for Herod's Siege

Fact: Consuls Marcus Agrippa and Caninius Gallus = 37 BC
Source: Josephus (Ant. 14.16.4); Roman records
Interpretation: Refers to siege start or capture
Dependencies: None
Confidence: Very High

H3. 185th Olympiad for Herod's Siege

Fact: 185th Olympiad (40-36 BC)
Source: Josephus (Ant. 14.16.4)
Interpretation: Siege spanned Olympiad end
Dependencies: Established Olympiad chronology
Confidence: High

H4. Lunar Eclipse Before Herod's Death

Fact: Partial eclipse March 13, 4 BC

Journey Timeline: Parthian invasion (Shavuot ~July 40 BC) → overland escape (4-6 weeks) → Alexandria (mid-August) → storm/shipwreck → Rhodes refitting (3+ months) → mare clausum (November-March) → Rome
Consular Reference: Josephus mentions consulship of Calvinus and Pollio (40 BC) - interpreted as marking journey start, not appointment completion
Dependencies: None (but requires assumption of rapid journey despite documented obstacles)
Confidence: High (but depends on unproven assumption about journey speed)

H6. Herod's Capture of Jerusalem

Fact: Summer 37 BC
Source: Josephus (Ant. 14.16.4; War 1.18.2)
Dependencies: H2, H3
Confidence: Very High (consular/Olympiad alignment)

Fact: Died AD 33/34 after 37 years
Source: Majority Greek MSS (9th-10th cent.); critical editions (Niese, Thackeray)
Calculation: 37 years back = 4 BC Herod death
Dependencies: H10 (Tiberius accession AD 14)
Confidence: High (majority reading, fits standard ante-dating)

H9b. Philip's Death - 22nd Year of Tiberius (Latin MSS Variant)

Fact: Died AD 35/36 after 37 years
Source: Some early Latin MSS (4th-8th cent.); minority Greek
Calculation: 37 years back = 1 BC Herod death
Dependencies: H10
Confidence: Moderate (older but minority; requires evaluation)

H10. Tiberius' Accession

Fact: AD 14 (upon Augustus' death)
Source: Suetonius, Tacitus, Dio Cassius
Dependencies: None
Confidence: Very High

H11. New Moon Month Start

Fact: Months begin at first crescent sighting
Source: Philo (Special Laws 2.140-142); Ben Sira (43:6-8); Elephantine Papyri (419 BC)
Dependencies: None
Confidence: Very High (ancient Jewish practice)

H12. Continuous 7-Day Week

Fact: Sabbath every 7th day, independent of moon
Source: Dead Sea Scrolls (calendars); Josephus (Sabbath = Saturn's day); Roman historians (Tacitus, Dio Cassius)
Dependencies: None
Confidence: Very High (no lunar Sabbath evidence)

H13. First Fruits Timing

Source: Rabbinic tradition (Pharisees); Leviticus 23:11 (post-Sabbath)
Alternative: Fixed 16th Nisan (Sadducees, Josephus Ant. 3.10.5; Philo Special Laws 2.162)
Dependencies: None
Confidence: High (rabbinic consensus; ancient debate)

Fact: Every 7 years; e.g., 37/36 BC (Herod's siege), 163/162 BC (Maccabees)
Source: Josephus (Ant. 14.16.2, 15.1.2); 1 Maccabees 6:49-53
Dependencies: None
Confidence: High (multiple alignments)


LEVEL 2: DERIVED HISTORICAL FACTS (Depend on Level 1)
H15. Herod's Death

Fact: Spring 4 BC (post-eclipse, pre-Passover)
Primary Evidence: H4 (eclipse); H6 + 34 years de facto (Ant. 17.8.1)
Supporting: Sons' reigns (H7, H8, H9a) start 4 BC
Alternative: 1 BC (minority; H9b variant, different eclipse)
Dependencies: H4, H6, H7-H9a, H10
Confidence: Very High (multiple lines; minority requires variants/special pleading)

H16. Herod's Regnal Start

Fact: Appointment 40 BC; de facto from 37 BC capture
Calculation: H5 + 3 years siege = H6 (37 BC)
Note: Battle of Actium (31 BC) dated to "seventh year of the reign" creates discrepancy:
- If regnal years from 40 BC: Year 7 = Spring 34-33 BC; Actium (Sept 2, 31 BC) is in Year 10 (3 years off)
- Alternative: Use inclusive de facto counting from 37 BC capture, but requires abandoning "reign" = regnal years
Dependencies: H5, H6
Confidence: High (but Battle of Actium reference creates 3-year discrepancy with regnal years)

H17. Crucifixion Year

Fact: 30 or 33 AD (Friday Passover)
Evidence: Pilate 26-36 AD; astronomical (April 7, 30 AD or April 3, 33 AD)
Dependencies: H15 (Herod death 4 BC → Jesus birth ~6-4 BC, age ~30-33)
Confidence: High (two main candidates; no consensus on one)

H18. Artaxerxes I's 7th Year

Fact: 458 BC (spring-to-spring)
Source: Elephantine Papyri; Cairo Stele (year 7 in 458 BC)
Alternative: 457 BC (fall-to-fall minority)
Dependencies: Persian chronology (accession 465 BC)
Confidence: Very High (artifacts confirm)

H19. Ezra's Decree

Fact: Spring 458 BC (Nisan 1 departure)
Evidence: Ezra 7:7-9 (journey Nisan-Av in year 7)
Dependencies: H18
Confidence: High

H20. Philip's Reign Start

Fact: 4 BC (post-Herod death)
Calculation: H9a (37 years to 33/34 AD)
Dependencies: H9a, H10, H15
Confidence: High (fits coins, Josephus majority)


LEVEL 3: SCRIPTURAL INTERPRETATIONS (Depend on A1-A5)
S1. Month Starts with New Moon Crescent

Fact: "New moon" = first visible crescent
Evidence: Implicit in festival timings (Passover full moon ~14th); Isaiah 66:23 (new moons distinct)
Dependencies: A3, A4
Confidence: High

S2. Day Starts at Sunset

Fact: Evening to evening (Gen 1:5; Lev 23:32)
Evidence: Multiple passages
Dependencies: A1, A2
Confidence: High

S3. First Fruits Variable

Fact: "Day after the Sabbath" = first Sunday after Passover
Evidence: Lev 23:11; rabbinic (Pharisees); counters fixed 16th paradox by variability
Alternative: Fixed 16th (Sadducees, LXX, Josephus, Philo)
Dependencies: A1, A2
Confidence: High (resolves counting issues)

S4. No Consecutive 15th Sabbaths Paradox

Fact: Exodus 16 manna narrative allows continuous week
Evidence: No mathematical impossibility if First Fruits variable
Dependencies: S3
Confidence: High

S5. No First Fruits Paradox

Fact: Lev 23:15-16 count works with variable First Fruits
Evidence: "Day after Sabbath" ensures 50th day post-7th Sabbath
Dependencies: S3
Confidence: High


LEVEL 4: CALENDAR SYSTEM CONCLUSIONS (Depend on S1-S5 + H series)
C1. Continuous Weekly Sabbath

Fact: Every 7th day, not lunar-tied
Evidence: No paradoxes if First Fruits variable; historical continuity
Dependencies: S4, S5, H12
Confidence: Very High

C2. Fixed Dateline

Fact: Gregorian/Saturday Sabbath preserved
Evidence: Roman-Jewish alignment (Sabbath = Saturday)
Dependencies: A3, H12
Confidence: High

C3. Planetary Week Adoption

Fact: Jews adopted continuous week; no pagan origin for cycle
Evidence: Pre-Roman evidence (Dead Sea Scrolls)
Dependencies: H12
Confidence: High


LEVEL 5: HISTORICAL VALIDATION (Depend on C1 + H series)
V1. Exodus Manna Test

Fact: Works with continuous week
Test: No paradox if variable First Fruits
Dependencies: S4, C1
Confidence: High

V2. Crucifixion Test

Fact: Friday Passover fits 30/33 AD
Test: Continuous week aligns
Dependencies: H17, C1
Confidence: High

V3. Temple Destruction Test

Fact: 70 AD (Av 9-10); not tied to lunar 8th
Evidence: Josephus (War 6.4.5-8); ramps on Sabbath
Dependencies: C1
Confidence: High


DEPENDENCY SUMMARY
Most Critical Paths:
Path 1: Herod's Death 4 BC
A1 → H4 → H15
A1 → H6 → H15
A1 → H7-H9a → H15 → H20
Path 2: Continuous Week
A1, A2 → S1 → C1
A1, A2 → S3 → S4 → S5 → C1
Path 3: Validation
C1 + H17 → V2
Weakest Links:

H9b (Latin Variant): If preferred, shifts to 1 BC death (minority)
S3 (First Fruits): Fixed vs variable debate; variable resolves paradoxes but fixed has ancient support
H17 (Crucifixion): 30 vs 33 AD split; evidence balanced

Strongest Multi-Witness Facts:

H15 (4 BC Death): Eclipse (H4), capture + reign (H6), sons' reigns (H7-H9a)
H12 (Continuous Week): Multiple ancient sources align Jewish Sabbath with Saturday

Strongest Independent Validations:

S4/S5 (No Paradoxes): Variable First Fruits resolves without lunar assumption
V3 (Temple): Historical date fits continuous cycle


NOTES FOR ANALYSIS
Distinguishing Dependencies from Mutual Reinforcement
True Dependencies: H15 depends on H4/H6 (cannot date death without eclipse/reign length)
Mutual Reinforcement: Sons' reigns (H7-H9a) and eclipse (H4) independently point to 4 BC, strengthening confidence
Confidence Levels

"Very High" for multi-source alignments
"High" for strong but debated evidence
Consensus strength in multiple independent historical anchors; minority views require variants or reinterpretations
