# Standardized Prompt for Independent AI Virtual Reviews
# "Time Tested Tradition" — Transparent Review Protocol
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USER:
#
# When using THIS INTERFACE (Cursor): The prompt below tells the AI exactly where the book lives in this workspace. Paste the prompt (everything below the dashed line) into the chat. You do NOT need to paste or attach the book—the AI will read it from the paths listed. Replace [AGENT] with the AI’s name before or after sending.
#
# When using another AI (Grok, Gemini, Claude in browser, GPT, etc.): Copy everything below the dashed line into that AI. Replace [AGENT] with that AI’s name. You must provide the book text yourself (e.g., paste or attach the contents from the paths listed below).
#
# Save each AI’s response with a filename that includes the agent name (e.g., review-claude.md, review-gpt.md).
#
# This prompt is published so readers know exactly what was asked; no incentive or bribe was given for a positive review.

You are acting as an independent book reviewer. Your task is to produce a single, self-contained review of the book "Time Tested Tradition" using the exact structure requested below. Your review will be published alongside reviews from other AI systems (e.g., Grok, Gemini, Claude, GPT); readers will see this same prompt so they know the evaluation was not tailored or incentivized.

## About the book (for context only)

"Time Tested Tradition" is a nonfiction book that examines biblical calendar, chronology, and related teachings from the author’s stated premise that Scripture is the primary authority and that traditional or consensus views should be tested against the text rather than assumed correct. Topics include when the day, month, and year begin; Sabbath observance; the dating of the crucifixion and resurrection (e.g., 32 AD); Herod the Great; appointed times/feasts; and the use of astronomical and historical evidence. The book argues for a full-moon start of the month and uses a fact-dependency structure and extra chapters for historical and astronomical support.

## Your role and how to evaluate

- Evaluate the book on its own terms: clarity of argument, use of sources, internal consistency, structure, and accessibility to a careful reader.
- Do not treat “agreement with mainstream or traditional religious interpretation” as the standard of quality. The book explicitly challenges some traditional views; assess whether its arguments are clear, well-sourced, and coherent, not whether they match a particular tradition.
- Be neutral and fair: note strengths and weaknesses in reasoning, evidence, and presentation. If you would need to read primary sources or run calculations to verify claims, say so rather than assuming the author is right or wrong.
- Write for a reader who is deciding whether to invest time in the book: be informative and balanced.

## Required output structure

Produce your full response in one reply, using the following sections and headings exactly.

---

### 1. Detailed assessment

Write a detailed evaluation (several paragraphs) covering at least:

- **Clarity and structure**: Is the argument easy to follow? Are terms defined? Is the organization helpful?
- **Use of evidence**: How does the book use Scripture, historical sources, and astronomical or chronological data? Are sources cited in a way a reader can check?
- **Internal consistency**: Do the claims and conclusions fit together? Are there contradictions or gaps?
- **Accessibility**: What kind of reader is this for? What background is assumed?
- **Notable strengths**: What does the book do well?
- **Limitations or concerns**: What would a cautious reader want to verify or question?
- **Summary judgment**: Overall quality and reliability of the presentation (not “correctness” by any one tradition’s standard).

---

### 2. One-paragraph review

A single paragraph (roughly 4–6 sentences) that a reader could use as a standard book review: what the book does, its strengths and limitations, and who might benefit from it.

---

### 3. One-sentence review

A single sentence that captures the essence of your evaluation and whether you would recommend it (and to whom).

---

### 4. One-phrase review (3 words or fewer)

A very short tagline or summary: three words or fewer (e.g., “Rigorous but dense,” “Worth a careful read,” “Niche and technical”).

---

### 5. Reviewer attribution

End with a single line:

**Reviewer: [AGENT]**  
**Prompt: Standardized independent virtual review (see AI_VIRTUAL_REVIEW_PROMPT.txt).**

Replace [AGENT] with your actual name (e.g., Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Grok).

---

Now perform the review. Read the book from the paths listed in "Where to find the book" above. If you do not have access to this workspace (e.g., you are not Cursor or another tool that can read these files), state that clearly at the start and do not fabricate a review. If you can read only some of the files, state which ones you used and limit your assessment to that material.
