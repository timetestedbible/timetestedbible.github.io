## Key Strong's Numbers

| Word | Strong's | Definition | KJV Translations |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|
| עֵז (*ez*) | H5795 | "a she-goat (as **strong**)" — from H5810 (עָזַז, to be strong/fierce) | goat, kid |
| שָׂעִיר (*sa'iyr*) | H8163 | "shaggy; as noun, a he-goat; by analogy, a faun" | **devil, goat, hairy, kid, rough, satyr** |
| תַּיִשׁ (*tayish*) | H8495 | "a buck or he-goat (as given to **butting**)" | he goat |
| עֲזָאזֵל (*azazel*) | H5799 | "goat of departure; the **scapegoat**" — from H5795 (goat) + H235 (to depart) | scapegoat |
| ἐρίφιον (*eriphion*) | G2055 | "a kidling, i.e. goat **(symbolically, wicked person)**" | goat |
| ἔριφος (*eriphos*) | G2056 | "a kid or goat" | goat, kid |

**Critical observations**:
- The Hebrew roots themselves reveal character: H5795 derives from **strength/fierceness**, H8495 means "given to **butting**" (aggression), and H8163 is also translated as **"devil" and "satyr"**
- The Greek G2055 carries the parenthetical note in Strong's: "**symbolically, wicked person**" — Strong's itself marks the symbolic meaning
- The goat's etymological DNA is aggression, stubbornness, and independence

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence — Sheep vs. Goats at Judgment

The most explicit text is **Matthew 25:31-46** — the judgment of the nations:

> "And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his **sheep** from the **goats**: And he shall set the **sheep** on his right hand, but the **goats** on the left." (Matt 25:32-33)

| SHEEP (right hand) | GOATS (left hand) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Come, ye **blessed** of my Father" (v.34) | "Depart from me, ye **cursed**" (v.41) |
| "**Inherit** the kingdom" (v.34) | "**Everlasting fire**, prepared for the devil and his angels" (v.41) |
| Fed the hungry (v.35) | Gave no meat (v.42) |
| Gave drink to the thirsty (v.35) | Gave no drink (v.42) |
| Took in the stranger (v.35) | Took not in (v.43) |
| Clothed the naked (v.36) | Clothed not (v.43) |
| Visited the sick (v.36) | Visited not (v.43) |
| Came to the imprisoned (v.36) | Came not (v.43) |

**The distinction is not belief vs. unbelief — it is DOING vs. NOT DOING.** The goats are condemned not for active wickedness but for **refusal to act**. They saw need and did nothing. This is the essence of self-will: "I see, I know, but I choose not to."

### 2. Zechariah 10:3 — Goats Punished Alongside Bad Shepherds

> "Mine anger was kindled against the **shepherds**, and I **punished the goats**: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah"

Here goats are:
- Explicitly **punished** by God
- Paired with bad shepherds (those who exploit the flock)
- Contrasted with "his flock the house of Judah" (the sheep/covenant people)

The goats represent those who are **within proximity** to the flock but are NOT sheep — they are the self-willed who refuse to submit to proper covenant authority.

### 3. Ezekiel 34:17 — Judged Within the Flock

> "And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the **he goats**."

Even within the flock (the covenant community), God distinguishes sheep from goats. The "he goats" (H6260, *attud* — "prepared, i.e. full grown; a he-goat; also a leader") are the aggressive ones who:

- Eat the good pasture and tread down the rest (v.18)
- Drink the deep waters and foul the rest (v.18)
- Thrust with side and shoulder (v.21)
- Push the diseased with their horns (v.21)
- Scatter the weak abroad (v.21)

**The goat character: aggressive self-provision at the expense of others.** They take for themselves and ruin what remains.

### 4. Daniel 8:5-8, 21 — The He-Goat as Conquering Power

> "And as I was considering, behold, an **he goat** came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes." (Dan 8:5)

> "And the rough **goat** is the **king of Grecia**: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king." (Dan 8:21)

The goat represents Greece (Alexander the Great) — characterized by:
- **Speed** — "touched not the ground" (v.5)
- **Fury/aggression** — "ran unto him in the fury of his power" (v.6)
- **Conquering ambition** — "waxed very great" (v.8)
- **Self-aggrandizement** — the horn "magnified himself" (v.11)

This is the goat nature writ large on the stage of nations: aggressive, self-willed conquest.

### 5. The Scapegoat — Leviticus 16:8-22

The Day of Atonement ritual involves **two goats**:

| Goat | Lot | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| First goat | "For the LORD" (v.8) | Killed as sin offering (v.15) |
| Second goat | "For the scapegoat" / *azazel* (v.8) | Carries sins into the wilderness — sent away (v.21-22) |

The scapegoat (*azazel*, H5799 — "goat of departure") bears the sins of the people and is sent into the wilderness — **expelled from the community**. This pictures the removal of sin and rebellion from among God's people.

The word *azazel* itself comes from H5795 (*ez*, goat) + H235 (*azal*, to go away/depart). The goat that departs — the self-willed one removed from the community.

### 6. H8163 — The Satyr/Saturn/Saturday Connection

The Hebrew word H8163 (*sa'iyr*, שָׂעִיר) is remarkable in its translation range:

| Translation | Context |
|-------------|---------|
| **he goat** | Sacrificial/literal contexts |
| **hairy** | Gen 27:11 — Esau described as a "hairy man" |
| **satyr** | Isa 13:21, Isa 34:14 — wild, demonic creatures in desolate places |
| **devil** | Lev 17:7, 2 Chr 11:15 — objects of illicit worship |

> "And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto **devils** [H8163, *sa'iyr* — lit. 'he-goats'/satyrs] after whom they have gone a whoring" (Lev 17:7)

> "he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the **devils** [H8163], and for the calves which he had made" (2 Chr 11:15)

> "**satyrs** [H8163] shall dance there" (Isa 13:21 — in the desolation of Babylon)

> "the **satyr** [H8163] shall cry to his fellow" (Isa 34:14 — in the desolation of Edom)

The same word for "he-goat" is used for demonic entities. This is not accidental — the goat nature (rebellious, self-willed, aggressive) maps to the satanic character. Note that in Matthew 25:41, the goats are sent into "everlasting fire, prepared for **the devil** and his angels."

#### The Satyr → Saturn → Saturday Chain

The linguistic and symbolic connections run deeper than English translations reveal:

- **H8163** (*sa'iyr*) = goat / satyr / devil — the hairy, shaggy goat-demon
- **Satyr** → **Satur** → **Saturn** — the Roman god often depicted with goat-like features in later mythology
- **Saturn's Day** → **Saturday** — the planetary day named after the goat-god

Stephen explicitly accused Israel of worshipping Saturn:

> "Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god **Remphan** [Saturn], figures which ye made to worship them" (Acts 7:43, quoting Amos 5:26)

Amos 5:26 names this deity as **Chiun** — identified by scholars (including Nelson's Bible Dictionary) as Saturn. The star-god Saturn was equated with Moloch, the deity demanding child sacrifices.

The LXX rendering of Amos 6 warns of "**false sabbaths**" in the context of this same idolatry — implying counterfeit rest days tied to planetary worship rather than God's appointed times.

This symbolic chain — goat → satyr → Saturn → Saturday — suggests that the "day of rest" named after Saturn carries the goat's symbolic DNA: self-will, rebellion against God's order, and demonic imitation of the true Sabbath. The goat-word (*sa'iyr*) appearing as both a sacrificial animal and a demonic entity points to a counterfeit: a false sabbath dressed in the clothing of the true one.

*(See [The Day of Saturn](/reader/book/11_The_Day_of_Saturn) for the full historical argument connecting Saturn worship to the modern Saturday Sabbath tradition.)*

### 7. The Behavioral Contrast — Sheep Nature vs. Goat Nature

| Characteristic | SHEEP | GOAT |
|----------------|-------|------|
| **Response to voice** | Hear and follow (John 10:27) | Do not hear/obey |
| **Movement** | Follow the shepherd | Go their own way |
| **Temperament** | Gentle, dependent | Aggressive, independent |
| **Hebrew root meaning** | "To migrate" (group movement) | "Strong/fierce" (H5795), "butting" (H8495) |
| **Relationship to others** | Vulnerable, harmless (Matt 10:16) | Thrust, push, foul (Ezek 34:18-21) |
| **At judgment** | Blessed, inherit kingdom | Cursed, depart |
| **Greek symbolic note** | — | "symbolically, wicked person" (G2055) |

### 8. Why "Self-Willed" and Not Other Meanings?

**Candidates considered:**

| Candidate | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| "Wicked" | Too broad; goats aren't defined by active evil but by refusal to do good (Matt 25) |
| "Unbeliever" | The goats in Matthew 25 recognize Jesus as "Lord" (v.44) — they are within proximity to faith |
| "Sinner" | Too generic; all have sinned — what distinguishes a goat specifically? |
| "Disobedient" | Close, but misses the aggressive/self-serving dimension (Ezek 34:18-21) |
| "Self-Willed" | Captures the full picture: refusal to submit (Matt 25), aggression toward others (Ezek 34), independence from the shepherd (Zech 10:3), self-aggrandizement (Dan 8) |

The goat's defining trait is not active malice but **self-will** — doing what they want, refusing to follow, taking for themselves at others' expense. This is why their condemnation in Matthew 25 is for what they **did not do** — self-will manifests as indifference to the needs of others.

---

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Matthew 25:32-33, 41-46** — The definitive judgment text. Sheep separated from goats. Goats condemned not for active evil but for failure to act — the essence of self-will.

2. **Zechariah 10:3** — "Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats." Goats explicitly punished alongside bad shepherds — both represent self-serving leadership within the covenant community.

3. **Ezekiel 34:17-21** — Within the flock, goats push, thrust, foul, and scatter the weak. Aggression and self-provision at others' expense.

4. **Daniel 8:5-8, 21** — "The rough goat is the king of Grecia." The goat nature as conquering ambition — furious, self-aggrandizing power.

5. **Leviticus 17:7** — "They shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils [H8163, *sa'iyr*, he-goats]." The goat-word used for demonic entities reveals the spiritual dimension of the goat nature: rebellion against God's order.

## Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Connection |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **SHEEP** | Covenant People | Explicit opposite at judgment (Matt 25:32-33) |
| **SHEPHERD** | Covenant Caretaker | Bad shepherds and goats punished together (Zech 10:3) |
| **WOLF** | Predator/Destroyer | External threat to the flock; goats are the internal threat |
| **ANIMAL** | People-Group | Goats as a sub-type: aggressive, independent-natured people |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | Goats represent the refusal to obey |
| **WICKEDNESS** | Lawlessness | Goat nature aligns with self-law (doing what is right in own eyes) |
| **SATURN/SATURDAY** | — | H8163 (*sa'iyr*) = goat = satyr → Saturn → Saturday; Acts 7:43 / Amos 5:26 identify Saturn worship among Israel |

## The Scapegoat — A Special Note

The Day of Atonement scapegoat (Lev 16) is a complex symbol that involves both the goat's representative function AND a typological picture of sin-removal. The scapegoat bears the sins of the people and is expelled into the wilderness. This pictures:

1. **Sin identified with the goat** — rebellion/self-will placed upon the goat
2. **Removal from the community** — the self-willed nature is sent away
3. **Into the wilderness** — away from God's provision and presence

This does not contradict the goat = self-willed meaning; it reinforces it. The self-willed nature is what must be removed from God's covenant community.

---

## Conclusion

**GOAT** symbolically represents **Self-Willed** — those who refuse to hear, follow, or submit to covenant authority, instead acting out of independence, aggression, and self-interest.

This is why:
- Goats are separated from sheep at judgment (the self-willed from the obedient — Matt 25:32)
- Goats are condemned for what they **did not do** (self-will = indifference to others — Matt 25:42-43)
- Goats push, thrust, and foul within the flock (the self-willed exploit the community — Ezek 34:18-21)
- Goats are punished alongside bad shepherds (both are self-serving — Zech 10:3)
- The he-goat represents conquering self-aggrandizement (Dan 8:21)
- The Hebrew word for he-goat (*sa'iyr*, H8163) also means "devil/satyr" (the ultimate self-will — rebellion against God)
- The satyr → Saturn → Saturday chain connects the goat symbol to counterfeit sabbath worship (Acts 7:43, Amos 5:26)
- The scapegoat is expelled from the community (self-will must be removed — Lev 16)
- Goat roots mean "strong/fierce" and "butting" — the character of self-assertion
