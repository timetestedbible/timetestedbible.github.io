## The Critical Discovery: H3671

Hebrew **כָּנָף (kanaph, H3671)** is translated as BOTH:
- **Wings** (of birds, cherubim)
- **Skirt** (of garments)
- **Border/Corner** (where tzitzit go)

English translations hide that these are the SAME WORD.

## The Explicit Definition — Ezekiel 16:8

> "I **spread my skirt** (H3671) **over thee**... and **ENTERED INTO A COVENANT** with thee"

**EXPLICIT**: Spreading wings/skirt = Entering covenant.

## The Ruth Connection

| Verse | Text | Word |
|-------|------|------|
| Ruth 2:12 | "under whose **wings** thou art come to trust" | H3671 |
| Ruth 3:9 | "spread thy **skirt** over me; for thou art a kinsman-redeemer" | H3671 |

**Same word!** Ruth came under God's covenant wings, then asked Boaz for covenant marriage.

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Ezekiel 16:8** — "spread my skirt... entered into COVENANT" — Explicit definition
2. **Ruth 2:12 / 3:9** — Same word (H3671) for divine and marital covenant
3. **Psalm 91:4** — "under his wings shalt thou trust" — Covenant trust
4. **Malachi 4:2** — "healing in his wings" — Covenant healing
5. **Matthew 23:37** — Hen gathers chicks "under her wings" — Covenant offer rejected
6. **Exodus 25:20** — Cherubim wings cover the ark of the COVENANT

## The Tzitzit Connection

> **Numbers 15:38** — "fringes in the **borders** (H3671) of their garments"

Tzitzit are on the WINGS/corners of the garment = covenant reminders on the "wings."

---

## Conclusion

**WINGS** = **Covenant Covering**

The same Hebrew word (H3671) encompasses bird wings, garment edges, and covenant covering — all expressions of protective, covering relationship.
