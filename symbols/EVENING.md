## The Key: What Actually Cleanses?

**"Unclean until the even"** is traditionally interpreted as "unclean until sunset."

But ask: **What cleanses—the passage of time, or atonement?**

Scripture is clear: *"It is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul"* (Leviticus 17:11).

If cleansing requires atonement, then "evening" refers to:

1. **The Evening Sacrifice** (around 3pm / 9th hour)
2. **The Time of Atonement** through the daily lamb offering

Waiting for sunset makes no theological sense—darkness doesn't cleanse. But waiting for the evening sacrifice does: the lamb's blood makes atonement.

## Evening Sacrifice Timing

The evening sacrifice (תָּמִיד, tamid) was offered:
- **Exodus 29:39, 41** — "at even" / "at evening"  
- **Numbers 28:4** — between the two evenings (בֵּין הָעַרְבַּיִם)
- **1 Kings 18:29, 36** — "the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice"

Historical records indicate this was around the **9th hour** (3pm), the same time:
- Jesus died on the cross (Matthew 27:46)
- The apostles went to temple for prayer (Acts 3:1)

## Why This Matters

If "evening" means the **evening sacrifice** (not sunset):
- Unclean until ~3pm, not until nightfall
- Restoration connected to the **daily sacrifice**, not the darkness
- The pattern: **morning sacrifice → day's work → evening sacrifice → cleansed**

This aligns with a morning-start day where evening brings cleansing through sacrifice.

## Pattern: Sacrifice Brings Cleansing

The unclean person:
1. **Washes** with water
2. **Waits** until the evening (sacrifice time)
3. **Is cleansed** when the offering is made

This connects physical uncleanness to spiritual restoration through sacrifice.

## Why Jesus Died at the 9th Hour

**Matthew 27:46** — *"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried..."*

Jesus died at **3pm**—the exact time of the evening sacrifice. This was not coincidental:

- The Lamb of God (John 1:29) died at the time of the evening lamb
- His blood provides the atonement that cleanses
- All who were "unclean" are cleansed through His sacrifice

The pattern of "unclean until the even" pointed forward to this: cleansing comes through the sacrifice, not through waiting for darkness.

## Key Passages

**Leviticus 11-15** — Laws of uncleanness, all restored "until the even"  
**Numbers 19** — Red heifer purification, unclean "until the even"  
**Exodus 29:39-41** — The two daily sacrifices (morning and evening)  
**1 Kings 18:36** — Elijah's sacrifice "at the time of the evening sacrifice"

## Daniel's 2300 "Evenings and Mornings"

**Daniel 8:14** — *"Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."*

The KJV translates this as "days," but the Hebrew literally says:

**עֶרֶב בֹּקֶר** (erev boqer) = "**evening morning**"

This is the same vocabulary used for the daily sacrifices! The context confirms this:
- **Daniel 8:11** — "the daily [sacrifice] was taken away"
- **Daniel 8:13** — "How long...the daily [sacrifice]...the sanctuary...trodden under foot?"
- **Daniel 8:14** — "2300 evening-mornings; then the sanctuary be cleansed"

The prophecy counts **sacrifices**, not days. Each day had two sacrifices (morning and evening), so:
- 2300 evening-mornings = **1150 days** of missed sacrifices
- This matches the ~3.5 years of Antiochus Epiphanes' desecration

### LXX Confirms "Evening and Morning"

The Septuagint (LXX) preserves the literal Hebrew, translating it as:

> *"**Evening and morning** there shall be two thousand and four hundred days; and then the sanctuary shall be cleansed."*  
> — [Daniel (Greek) 8:14](/reader/bible/lxx/Daniel%20(Greek)/8)

The Greek translators (c. 250 BC) understood this as "evening and morning"—the language of daily sacrifices—not merely "days."

When "evening" refers to sacrifice, prophecy makes more sense.

## Cross-Reference

- **SACRIFICE** — Evening offering as daily atonement
- **WASHING** — Physical cleansing before spiritual restoration
- **DAY** — When does the biblical day begin?
