## Strong's Numbers

**Hebrew**: יַיִן (*yayin*, H3196) — wine (as fermented); by implication, intoxication

**Hebrew**: תִּירוֹשׁ (*tirosh*, H8492) — must, fresh grape-juice; new wine

**Greek**: οἶνος (*oinos*, G3631) — wine (literally or figuratively)

## The Explicit Definition — Blood of Grapes

Scripture explicitly calls wine "blood":

> **Genesis 49:11** — "he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the **blood of grapes**"

> **Deuteronomy 32:14** — "thou didst drink the pure **blood of the grape**"

WINE = BLOOD OF GRAPES. This is not metaphor but definitional statement.

## Blood = Life

> **Leviticus 17:11** — "For the **life of the flesh is in the blood**: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul."

Blood contains life. Blood atones (covers, reconciles). Therefore:

- **WINE** = Blood of grapes = **LIFE** poured out

## Blood Ratifies Covenant

Covenants are sealed with blood:

> **Exodus 24:8** — "And Moses took the **blood**, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the **blood of the covenant**, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words."

> **Zechariah 9:11** — "As for thee also, by the **blood of thy covenant** I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit"

> **Hebrews 13:20** — "the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the **blood of the everlasting covenant**"

Blood seals the covenant. Wine represents that blood.

## The Cup of the New Covenant

At the Last Supper, Jesus explicitly connects wine to covenant blood:

> **Matthew 26:28** — "For this is my **blood of the new testament** (covenant), which is shed for many for the remission of sins."

> **Luke 22:20** — "This cup is the **new testament** (covenant) **in my blood**, which is shed for you."

> **1 Corinthians 11:25** — "This cup is the **new testament** (covenant) **in my blood**: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."

The wine IS the covenant blood — the life poured out to ratify the agreement.

## Bread and Wine Together

| Element | Meaning | Covenant Function |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **BREAD** | Word of God | The TERMS of covenant |
| **WINE** | Blood | The RATIFICATION of covenant |

The covenant meal includes both:
- **Bread** = accepting the terms (Word/Torah)
- **Wine** = sealing with blood (life commitment)

This mirrors Exodus 24:
1. Moses reads the words of the covenant (v.7) — BREAD
2. Moses sprinkles the blood on the people (v.8) — WINE
3. The elders eat and drink in God's presence (v.11) — COVENANT MEAL

---

## Wine = Joy (Covenant Blessing)

When in covenant, wine represents joy and celebration:

> **Psalm 104:15** — "And **wine** that maketh **glad** the heart of man"

> **Ecclesiastes 9:7** — "drink thy wine with a **merry heart**; for God now accepteth thy works"

> **Isaiah 65:8** — "As the **new wine** is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not; for a **blessing** is in it"

The joy comes from covenant relationship — life shared with God.

---

## Wine = Wrath (Covenant Broken)

When covenant is broken, the same blood brings judgment:

> **Revelation 14:10** — "The same shall drink of the **wine of the wrath of God**, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation"

> **Revelation 16:19** — "great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the **wine of the fierceness of his wrath**"

> **Revelation 19:15** — "he treadeth the **winepress of the fierceness and wrath** of Almighty God"

Blood rejected becomes blood guilt. The covenant blood that should have brought life instead brings death.

---

## The Dual Nature of Wine

| State | Meaning | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **In covenant** | Life-blood shared | Joy, blessing, fellowship |
| **Covenant broken** | Blood guilt | Wrath, judgment, death |

The same wine represents both — depending on one's relationship to the covenant.

---

## Drink His Blood = Receive His Life

> **John 6:53-54** — "Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and **drink his blood**, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and **drinketh my blood**, hath eternal life"

To drink His blood is to:
1. Receive His life
2. Enter His covenant
3. Accept the terms ratified by that blood

---

## Related Symbols

- **BREAD** — Word of God / covenant terms (paired with wine)
- **BLOOD** — Life; what seals covenant
- **CUP** — Portion, destiny (cup of blessing or cup of wrath)
- **GRAPES** — Source of wine; fruit of the vine
- **WINEPRESS** — Judgment; blood poured out

## Summary

**WINE** = **BLOOD** = **COVENANT RATIFICATION**

Wine is explicitly called "the blood of grapes." Blood contains life and ratifies covenant. The cup of wine represents:
- Life poured out to seal relationship
- Joy when in covenant (blessing)
- Wrath when covenant broken (judgment)

At the Lord's Table, bread = terms (Word), wine = blood (ratification). Together they constitute the covenant meal.

> "This cup is the new covenant in my blood"
