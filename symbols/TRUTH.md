# TRUTH — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Commandment |
| **Two Words** | God's Standard |
| **Sentence** | God's word, law, and instructions that define how things actually are and ought to be—the standard by which all is measured |

**Opposite**: Lie / Deception / False standard / Man's way

---

## The Argument

### 1. Recursive Definitions — Truth IS Word IS Law

Scripture explicitly equates TRUTH with other foundational concepts:

| Equation | Reference |
|----------|-----------|
| **Thy WORD is TRUTH** | John 17:17 |
| **Thy LAW is the TRUTH** | Psalm 119:142 |
| **I am the way, the TRUTH, and the life** | John 14:6 |

This establishes the chain: **TRUTH → WORD → LAW → God's Standard/Commandments**

### 2. Behavioral Verification — "Doing" Truth

Truth is something you **DO**, not just something you know:

- **John 3:21** — "he that **doeth truth** cometh to the light"
- **1 John 1:6** — "If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and **do not the truth**"

**Test**: Can you "do" commandments? Yes — you keep them.
**Test**: Can you "do" God's standard? Yes — you live by it.

This confirms: TRUTH = something actionable = commandments/standard

### 3. Connection to Freedom

| Verse | What Sets Free |
|-------|----------------|
| John 8:32 | "The **TRUTH** shall make you free" |
| John 8:36 | "If the **SON** shall make you free" |
| John 8:34 | "Whosoever committeth **SIN** is the servant of sin" |

**The Logic**:
- Sin = bondage
- Truth/Son = freedom from sin
- Truth = God's standard (which, when kept, prevents sin)

### 4. Connection to Sanctification

**John 17:17** — "**Sanctify** them through thy truth: thy word is truth"

What sanctifies (sets apart, makes holy)? God's truth = God's word = God's commandments.

**John 17:19** — Christ sanctifies Himself through the truth so that believers may be sanctified through the truth.

### 5. Connection to Light

We previously established: **LIGHT = Visible Example**

Now observe:
- **John 3:21** — "he that doeth truth cometh to the **light**"
- **1 John 1:6-7** — Walking in darkness = not doing truth; walking in light = doing truth

**The relationship**:
- TRUTH = the standard (God's word/commandments)
- LIGHT = the visible demonstration of living by that standard

"Doing truth" → "Coming to light" = Keeping God's standard → Becoming a visible example

### 6. Antithetical Analysis

**The opposite of TRUTH is LIE/DECEPTION**:

- **1 John 1:6** — "we **lie**, and do not the truth"
- **1 John 2:4** — "He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a **liar**, and the truth is not in him"
- **John 8:44** — The devil "abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own"

If TRUTH = God's standard/commandments, then:
LIE = rejecting God's standard / living by a false standard / man's way instead of God's way

This aligns: Satan's lie in the garden was to reject God's commandment.

## Key Insight: Symbolic ≠ Dictionary Meaning

The dictionary defines "truth" as "factual accuracy" or "conformity to reality."

The **symbolic meaning** in Scripture is more specific: TRUTH = **God's word/law/commandments** — the divine standard that defines what reality actually is and how to live rightly.

This is why:
- You can "DO" truth (keep commandments)
- Truth "sanctifies" (God's word sets apart)
- Truth "makes free" (God's law liberates from sin's bondage)

---

## Conclusion

**TRUTH** symbolically represents **God's Standard** — His word, law, and commandments that define how things actually are and ought to be.

- **Jesus IS truth** because He perfectly embodies and teaches God's standard
- **Doing truth** means keeping God's commandments
- **Walking in truth** means living according to God's word
- **The truth makes free** because God's standard liberates from the bondage of sin
