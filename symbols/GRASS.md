# GRASS — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | People |
| **Two Words** | Mortal People |
| **Sentence** | Human beings in their transience and mortality — flesh that flourishes briefly and then is gone, subject to the wind/Spirit of God |

**Opposite**: The Word of God = Eternal, unchanging (Isaiah 40:8 — "The grass withereth... but the word of our God shall stand for ever")

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly defines grass as people — twice in the same passage:

> "All **flesh** is **grass**, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field: The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely **the people is grass**." — Isaiah 40:6-7

This is as explicit as biblical definitions get. Isaiah 40:7 states it flatly: "surely **the people is grass**." The equation is FLESH = GRASS = PEOPLE.

The New Testament confirms and quotes this definition:

> "For **all flesh** is as **grass**, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: But the word of the Lord endureth for ever." — 1 Peter 1:24-25

Peter directly quotes Isaiah 40:6-8, carrying the GRASS = PEOPLE equation into the NT.

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What does grass DO in Scripture?

| Function | Verse | Significance |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Flourishes briefly** | Psalm 103:15 — "As for man, his days are as grass... so he flourisheth" | People have a brief season of life |
| **Withers under the Spirit/Wind** | Isaiah 40:7 — "the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it" | Subject to God's power |
| **Is gone (אַיִן)** | Psalm 103:16 — "the wind passeth over it, and it is gone" | Removed by the wind/Spirit |
| **Cut down** | Psalm 37:2 — "they shall soon be cut down like the grass" | Judgment on the wicked |
| **Grows in the morning, withers by evening** | Psalm 90:5-6 — "in the morning like grass... in the evening it is cut down" | A single day represents a lifetime |
| **Burns** | Revelation 8:7 — "all green grass was burnt up" | Judgment by fire upon people |
| **Feeds cattle** | Psalm 104:14 — "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle" | Sustains others (peoples sustain nations) |

### 3. The Behavioral Evidence

How are humans commanded to relate to grass?

- **Do not trust in human glory**: Matthew 6:30 / Luke 12:28 — "if God so clothe the grass... shall he not much more clothe you?" — Grass (people/human effort) is temporary; trust God instead.
- **Do not boast in riches**: James 1:10-11 — "as the flower of the grass he shall pass away... so also shall the rich man fade away" — Human wealth is as transient as grass.

### 4. The Antithetical Evidence

Grass is consistently contrasted with the **Word of God**:

| Grass (People) | Word of God |
|----------------|-------------|
| Withers | Stands forever (Isaiah 40:8) |
| Fades | Endures (1 Peter 1:25) |
| Temporary | Eternal |
| Subject to wind/Spirit | IS the standard |

> "The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but **the word of our God shall stand for ever**." — Isaiah 40:8

If GRASS = PEOPLE, then the contrast is: **People are temporary; God's word is eternal.**

### 5. The Human Application Test

Can humans BE grass? **YES** — Scripture explicitly says so:

- Isaiah 40:6 — "All flesh is grass"
- Isaiah 40:7 — "surely the people is grass"
- Psalm 103:15 — "as for man, his days are as grass"
- Isaiah 51:12 — "the son of man which shall be made as grass"
- 1 Peter 1:24 — "all flesh is as grass"
- James 1:10-11 — the rich man is like the flower of grass

### 6. Why "People" and Not Other Meanings?

**Considered alternatives:**

| Meaning | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Vegetation" | Literal synonym — not symbolic |
| "Provision/Food" | Only accounts for cattle-feeding function, not the withering/transience |
| "Frailty" | Abstract quality, not a concrete symbolic meaning |
| "Temporary things" | Too broad — grass specifically equals people/flesh |

**"People" unifies all functions:**
- People flourish briefly (grass grows and withers)
- People are subject to God's power (grass withers under the Spirit)
- People are transient compared to God's word (grass vs. the eternal word)
- Judgment falls on people (grass is cut down, burned)
- People sustain larger structures (grass feeds cattle/nations)

## Key Proof Texts

### 1. Isaiah 40:6-8 — The Explicit Definition

> "All flesh is grass... surely the people is grass. The grass withereth... but the word of our God shall stand for ever."

The clearest text. PEOPLE = GRASS is stated outright, twice. The withering represents human mortality/transience. The contrast with God's eternal word establishes the symbolic framework.

### 2. Psalm 103:15-16 — The Wind, the Grass, and אַיִן

> "As for man, his days are as grass... For the wind passeth over it, and it is **gone** (אַיִן, H369), and the place thereof shall know it no more."

The wind/Spirit (רוּחַ) passes over the grass/people and they become אַיִן (gone). "The place thereof shall know it no more" — the location they occupied is empty. Those left behind see only absence.

This connects to the [אַיִן pattern](/reader/words/H369): the Spirit acting on people (grass) to remove them. The surface meaning is mortality; the deeper pattern connects to divine removal (Enoch, Elijah).

### 3. Revelation 8:7 — Grass Burned in Judgment

> "The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and **all green grass was burnt up**."

If GRASS = PEOPLE and TREES = NATIONS (see [TREE study](/reader/symbols/TREE)), then: a third of nations are destroyed, and all common people suffer.

### 4. Revelation 9:4 — Grass Protected by God's Seal

> "And it was commanded them that they should **not hurt the grass of the earth**, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but **only those men which have not the seal of God** in their foreheads."

This verse distinguishes between "grass" and "those men" — but the instruction is: don't hurt the grass/trees, only hurt the unsealed men. If grass symbolically represents people, then "don't hurt the grass" = "don't hurt [God's] people" — hurt only the unsealed. This parallels the marking in Ezekiel 9:4-6 where those with the mark are spared.

### 5. Daniel 4:25,32-33 — Nebuchadnezzar Eating Grass

> "they shall make thee to **eat grass as oxen**"

When Nebuchadnezzar is driven from men and made to eat grass like an animal, the symbolic reading adds a layer: the king is reduced to consuming/ruling over common people as a beast would. His kingdom is reduced to the level of grass — ordinary people — rather than the great tree he had been (Daniel 4:10-12). The tree (nation) was cut down; what remains is grass (common people).

## Substitution Test

| Verse | With "People" |
|-------|---------------|
| "All flesh is grass" (Isa 40:6) | "All flesh is [people]" ✓ (tautological — flesh IS people) |
| "surely the people is grass" (Isa 40:7) | "surely the people is [people]" ✓ (explicit confirmation) |
| "the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it" (Isa 40:7) | "the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon [the people]" ✓ |
| "the grass withereth" (Isa 40:7) | "[the people] wither" ✓ |
| "they shall soon be cut down like the grass" (Ps 37:2) | "they shall soon be cut down like [people]" ✓ (wicked cut down like mortals) |
| "all green grass was burnt up" (Rev 8:7) | "all [living people] were burnt up" ✓ |
| "should not hurt the grass of the earth" (Rev 9:4) | "should not hurt the [people] of the earth" ✓ |
| "He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle" (Ps 104:14) | "He causeth [people] to grow for the [nations]" ✓ (if cattle = nations) |
| "As for man, his days are as grass" (Ps 103:15) | "As for man, his days are as [people's days]" ✓ (all people share this condition) |

## Connection to the אַיִן Pattern

The grass symbol is a key link in the [אַיִן divine-removal pattern](/reader/words/H369):

1. **Isaiah 40:7** explicitly says: PEOPLE = GRASS
2. **Isaiah 40:7** says: the **Spirit (רוּחַ) of the LORD bloweth** upon the grass/people
3. **Psalm 103:16** says: the wind passes over it, and it is **gone (אַיִן)**
4. **2 Kings 2:16** says: the **Spirit (רוּחַ) of the LORD** hath **taken him [Elijah] up**

The mechanism is identical: the Spirit/Wind (רוּחַ) acts on people (grass) → they become אַיִן (gone/taken). In the grass passages, the surface meaning is mortality. In the Elijah passage, it is divine translation. Both use the same vocabulary and mechanism, suggesting the grass symbol operates on multiple levels.

## Wheat, Barley, and Tares — Types of Grass

Botanically, **wheat**, **barley**, and **tares** (darnel/weeds) are all grasses — members of the grass family (Poaceae). This is not a modern classification; it is visually obvious. They grow the same way, look similar in early stages, and share the same form: blades, stalks, heads of grain.

If GRASS = PEOPLE, then the specific *types* of grass represent specific *types* of people:

| Grass Type | Symbolic Meaning | Key Verse |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Wheat** | God's faithful people | Matthew 13:25-30 — "the good seed are the children of the kingdom" |
| **Barley** | Firstfruits / early harvest | Ruth 1:22, Revelation 14:15-16 — barley harvest comes first |
| **Tares** (darnel) | False believers / children of the wicked one | Matthew 13:38 — "the tares are the children of the wicked one" |

Jesus' Parable of the Wheat and Tares (Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43) is built on this: both wheat and tares are grasses. They grow together in the same field. They look alike. You cannot easily distinguish them until the harvest — when the fruit reveals the identity. The tares are gathered and burned; the wheat is gathered into the barn.

This reinforces GRASS = PEOPLE: the different varieties of grass represent different categories of people, all growing in the same field (the world), sorted at the harvest (judgment).

## The Flower — The Best of the People

The "flower of the grass" or "flower of the field" represents the **best/glory** of the people:

> "all the **goodliness** thereof is as **the flower** of the field" (Isaiah 40:6)

> "as **the flower of the grass** he shall pass away" (James 1:10 — applied to the rich)

If grass = common people, the flower = the elite, the wealthy, the prominent. Even the best of humanity withers — the glory of man fades like the finest flower.

---

## Conclusion

**GRASS** symbolically represents **PEOPLE** — specifically, mortal human beings in their transience, frailty, and subjection to God's power. Scripture states this explicitly: "surely the people is grass" (Isaiah 40:7).

This meaning works for:
- **Mortality**: People flourish briefly and wither (Psalm 90:5-6, 103:15-16)
- **Judgment**: People are cut down and burned (Psalm 37:2, Revelation 8:7)
- **Divine action**: The Spirit/Wind of God acts on people and they are gone (Isaiah 40:7, Psalm 103:16)
- **Contrast with God**: People are temporary; God's word is eternal (Isaiah 40:8)
- **The flower**: The glory/elite of the people also fades (James 1:10-11)

The grass-wind-אַיִן connection (Psalm 103:16) links this symbol to the broader pattern of divine removal traced in the [H369 study](/reader/words/H369).
