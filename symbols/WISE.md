# WISE — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Dimension | Meaning |

| **IS (Two Words)** | Commandment Keeper |
| **DOES (One Word)** | Does |
| **DOES (Two Words)** | Receives and Acts |

## The Key: Explicit Definitions

### Psalm 111:10 — The Foundational Definition

> "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of **wisdom**: a good understanding have all they that **DO his commandments**"

WISDOM is explicitly connected to **DOING commandments**. Those who DO = wise.

### Deuteronomy 4:6 — Wisdom = Keeping/Doing

> "**Keep** therefore and **do** them; for this is your **wisdom** and your understanding in the sight of the nations"

Israel's WISDOM would be demonstrated by keeping and doing God's statutes.

### Matthew 7:24 — The Wise Builder

> "Therefore whosoever **heareth** these sayings of mine, and **DOETH them**, I will liken him unto a **wise** man, which built his house upon a rock"

The WISE man is explicitly defined as one who hears AND does.

---

## Primary Evidence

### 1. Proverbs 10:8 — Wise Receives Commandments

> "The **wise** in heart will **receive commandments**: but a prating fool shall fall."

| Wise | Fool |
|------|------|
| Receives commandments | Falls |
| Obedient | Disobedient |

### 2. Proverbs 12:15 — Wise Hearkens to Counsel

> "The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that **hearkeneth unto counsel** is **wise**."

The wise listens to instruction (and follows it) rather than following their own way.

### 3. Proverbs 1:7 — Fear of the LORD

> "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but **fools despise** wisdom and instruction."

The opposite of fools (who despise instruction) is the wise (who fear the LORD and receive instruction).

The wise built on ROCK (covenant), the foolish on SAND (broken covenant).

### Matthew 25:1-13 — The Ten Virgins

|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Wise** | Had OIL (proven works) | OBEDIENT — had built up works through doing |
