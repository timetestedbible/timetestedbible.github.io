# ISLAND — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Sanctified |
| **Two Words** | Set-Apart People |
| **Sentence** | A people distinguished and separated from the chaotic mass of nations — those set apart (holy/sanctified) from the sea of humanity |

**Opposite**: Sea = The unsanctified masses / peoples not set apart

---

## The Argument

### 1. Prerequisite: SEA = Peoples/Nations

Before understanding ISLAND, we must establish what SEA represents:

> **Revelation 17:15** — "The **waters** which thou sawest... are **peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues**."

The sea represents the chaotic mass of humanity — the nations in their unsanctified, turbulent state.

### 2. The Key Relationship: SET APART FROM

An island is land that is **SET APART FROM** the sea — surrounded by water but distinct from it, elevated above it.

The critical insight is not what an island IS (solid land), but what an island DOES in relation to the sea: it is **SEPARATED** from the surrounding waters.

### 3. "Set Apart" = SANCTIFIED / HOLY

The biblical concept of holiness (Hebrew: קָדוֹשׁ qadosh) literally means "**set apart**."

- To be **sanctified** is to be **set apart** from the common/profane
- To be **holy** is to be **separated** for God's purposes

Therefore:
- **SEA** = the nations (common, unsanctified masses)
- **ISLAND** = a people **SET APART** from the nations = **SANCTIFIED / HOLY**

### 4. Scriptural Patterns

#### A. Isles of the Gentiles — Distinct Peoples

> **Genesis 10:5** — "By these were the **isles of the Gentiles divided** in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations."

The isles represent peoples who became **distinct**, **divided**, **separated** — each with their own identity, language, and territory.

#### B. Isles Wait for God's Law

> **Isaiah 42:4** — "He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the **isles shall wait for his law**."

> **Isaiah 51:5** — "The **isles shall wait upon me**, and on mine arm shall they trust."

> **Isaiah 60:9** — "Surely the **isles shall wait for me**..."

The set-apart peoples await God's standard (TRUTH/LAW). This connects to sanctification through truth:

> **John 17:17** — "**Sanctify** them through thy **truth**: thy word is truth."

The isles (set-apart peoples) wait for the very thing that sanctifies: God's word/law/truth.

#### C. Islands Paired with Mountains in Judgment

> **Revelation 6:14** — "And the heaven departed as a scroll... and every **mountain** and **island** were moved out of their places."

> **Revelation 16:20** — "And every **island** fled away, and the **mountains** were not found."

We established: **MOUNTAIN = Kingdom** (ruling authority).

Mountains and islands are paired because both represent **ordered structures** distinguished from the chaotic sea:
- **MOUNTAIN** = Kingdom (political authority)
- **ISLAND** = Sanctified people (holy nation)

Both are shaken when God's judgment comes upon the earth.

### 5. The Recursive Symbolic Picture

The symbolic meaning emerges from the RELATIONSHIP between symbols:

```
SEA = Peoples/Nations (chaotic, unsanctified)
       ↓
ISLAND = Land SET APART FROM the sea
       ↓
"Set Apart" = SANCTIFIED / HOLY
       ↓
ISLAND = Sanctified/Set-Apart People
```

This creates a beautiful connection to other symbols:
- **TRUTH** (God's word/law) **sanctifies** (John 17:17)
- **ISLAND** represents the **sanctified** people (set apart from the sea)
- The isles **wait for God's law** (Isaiah 42:4) — the very thing that sanctifies them

## Substitution Test

| Verse | Original | With "Sanctified/Set-Apart People" |
|-------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Genesis 10:5 | "Isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands" | "Set-apart peoples distinguished by territory" ✓ |
| Isaiah 42:4 | "The isles shall wait for his law" | "The sanctified peoples await his standard" ✓ |
| Isaiah 51:5 | "The isles shall wait upon me" | "The set-apart peoples shall trust in me" ✓ |
| Isaiah 60:9 | "The isles shall wait for me" | "The sanctified shall await me" ✓ |
| Isaiah 66:19 | "Send to the isles afar off" | "Send to the distant set-apart peoples" ✓ |
| Rev 6:14 | "Every mountain and island moved" | "Every kingdom and sanctified people shaken" ✓ |
| Rev 16:20 | "Every island fled away" | "Every set-apart people displaced" ✓ |

## Methodological Note: The Relationship Principle

This symbol was decoded by analyzing the **RELATIONSHIP** between island and sea, not just the physical characteristics of an island.

**Wrong approach**: Island = solid, stable, fixed land (physical description)
**Right approach**: Island = land SET APART FROM the sea (relational/symbolic action)

The **verb implicit in the relationship** ("set apart") pointed to the biblical concept of **sanctification/holiness**.

> **Principle**: When a symbol exists in relationship to another symbol, the relationship itself may reveal the meaning. Look for the action/verb, not just the noun.

---

## Conclusion

**ISLAND** symbolically represents a **sanctified/set-apart people** — those distinguished and separated from the chaotic sea of nations. The meaning derives not from physical characteristics but from the relationship: an island is land **SET APART FROM** the sea, and "set apart" is the very definition of holiness/sanctification.

This connects to the broader symbolic web:
- **SEA** = unsanctified peoples/nations
- **ISLAND** = sanctified/set-apart people
- **TRUTH** = God's word/law (the means of sanctification)
- **MOUNTAIN** = kingdom (ruling authority)

The isles "wait for his law" because God's truth is what sanctifies and sets apart his people from the sea of nations.
