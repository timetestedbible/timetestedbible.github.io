## Two Approaches — Same Conclusion

This symbol was analyzed using two different methodologies that converged on the same answer.

### Approach A: Problem-Driven (Paradox Resolution)

#### Paradox 1: The Abraham Contradiction

> **Exodus 6:3** — "by **my name YHWH I was not known** to them"

Yet YHWH was clearly **spoken** to Abraham (Genesis 15:7, 18:14, 22:16).

**Resolution**: NAME ≠ the word/pronunciation. It must be something deeper.

#### Paradox 2: The "Lord, Lord" Problem

> **Matthew 7:22-23** — People who said "Lord, Lord" and did miracles "in thy name" were rejected as "workers of **lawlessness**"

**Resolution**: NAME must be connected to LAW/OBEDIENCE/COVENANT — not just spoken words.

#### The Explicit Equation: NAME = ARK = COVENANT

> **2 Samuel 7:2** — David wants to build a house for "the **ark** of God"
> **2 Samuel 7:13** — God says: "He shall build a house for **My NAME**"

God substitutes "My NAME" for "the ark [of the covenant]" — revealing they are the same: **THE COVENANT**.

#### Solomon's Prayer (1 Kings 8)

"The NAME" appears **16 times**, always in COVENANT context: forgiveness, repentance, restoration.

**Conclusion (Approach A)**: NAME = COVENANT

---

### Approach B: Pattern-Based (Systematic Analysis)

#### Strong's Definitions

- **H8034 (שֵׁם)**: "honor, authority, character"
- **G3686 (ὄνομα)**: "authority, character"

Authority comes from RELATIONSHIP — specifically, COVENANT.

#### Key Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| "In the NAME" | Invoking covenant authority |
| "For his NAME's sake" | Because of covenant obligation |
| "Baptized in the NAME" | Entering covenant relationship |
| "No other NAME" | No other covenant for salvation |

#### The Relationship Test

When a symbol involves **invoking** something, ask: "What RELATIONSHIP is being invoked?"

**Conclusion (Approach B)**: NAME = COVENANT

---

## The Convergence

Both approaches arrive at the same answer, confirming the interpretation.

---

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Acts 4:12** — "none other **name**... whereby we must be saved" — No other COVENANT
2. **2 Samuel 7:13** — "build a house for **My Name**" — NAME = ARK of COVENANT
3. **Matthew 7:22-23** — "in thy **name**... workers of **lawlessness**" — NAME requires covenant-keeping
4. **Deuteronomy 28:58** — "do all the words of this law... fear this **name**" — Torah connected to NAME

---

## The Third Commandment

> **Exodus 20:7** — "Thou shalt not take the **name** of YHWH thy God **in vain**"

If NAME = COVENANT:
- "Taking the name in vain" = Making the covenant nothing
- Not about pronunciation — about living as if the covenant doesn't matter
- "Workers of lawlessness" (Matt 7:23) took His name in vain

---

## Conclusion

**THE NAME** = **COVENANT**. To invoke "the name" is to appeal to covenant. To profane "the name" is to dishonor covenant. To believe on "the name" is to trust covenant. There is "no other NAME" because there is no other COVENANT for salvation.
