# WIND / FOUR WINDS

**Hebrew**: רוּחַ (*ruach*, H7307) — wind, breath, spirit, quarter/direction  
**Greek**: ἄνεμος (*anemos*, G417) — wind; (plural) the four quarters of the earth  
**Aramaic**: רוּחַ (*ruach*, H7308) — corresponding to Hebrew, used in Daniel

## Wind Equals Spirit

The Hebrew word *ruach* encompasses both the literal wind and the spiritual realm. This is not coincidence but revelation: wind—invisible, powerful, moving where it wills—is the physical picture of spirit. What wind does in the natural realm, spirit does in the spiritual.

> "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." (John 3:8)

Jesus explicitly draws the parallel: as wind moves invisibly yet powerfully, so does the Spirit work in those born again.

## The Four Winds Defined

Zechariah provides the explicit interpretation:

> "And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the **four spirits of the heavens**, which **go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth**." (Zechariah 6:5)

The four winds ARE the four spirits. They:
1. Stand before the Lord (in His presence/throne room)
2. Go forth (are dispatched with a mission)
3. Operate throughout all the earth (universal scope)

The four chariots in Zechariah's vision—with horses of different colors going to different directions—represent these spirits executing God's purposes in every corner of the earth.

## What the Four Winds Do

Scripture shows the four winds/spirits executing several distinct missions:

### 1. Scattering (Judgment/Dispersal)

> "Upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come." (Jeremiah 49:36)

> "I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD." (Zechariah 2:6)

The four winds scatter nations as judgment—dispersing peoples to all directions.

### 2. Gathering (Restoration/Resurrection)

> "And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." (Matthew 24:31)

> "Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live." (Ezekiel 37:9)

The same winds that scatter can also gather. In Ezekiel's vision, the breath/spirit comes from the four winds to resurrect the dry bones—bringing life from death, gathering what was scattered.

### 3. Stirring Up Nations

> "Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea." (Daniel 7:2-3)

The four winds stir the sea (nations) and from this stirring arise the four great empires. God's spirits agitate the nations to produce the kingdoms that serve His prophetic purposes.

### 4. Restraining (Withholding Judgment)

> "And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree." (Revelation 7:1)

The four winds can be restrained—held back by angels until God's timing is complete. The sealing of the 144,000 must occur before the winds are released.

## The East Wind Specifically

While the four winds together represent God's universal agency, the EAST WIND specifically carries a consistent meaning of **judgment and destruction**:

> "Seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind... shall be seven years of famine." (Genesis 41:27)

> "Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind." (Hosea 12:1)

> "An east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry." (Hosea 13:15)

> "They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind." (Habakkuk 1:9)

The east wind comes from the desert/wilderness and brings drying, destruction, and judgment. It is specifically called "the wind of the LORD" in Hosea 13:15.

## Psalm 104:4 — Ministers of Fire

> "Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire." (Psalm 104:4)

This verse connects:
- Angels = spirits (ruach/wind)
- Ministers = flaming fire

God's angels ARE spirits/winds—they are His ministers executing His will. The four winds/spirits of Zechariah 6 are angelic forces dispatched from the throne.

## The Number Four

The number FOUR in Scripture represents:
- The whole earth (four corners, four directions)
- Universality and completeness of earthly scope
- The created order (four winds, four seasons, four elements in ancient thought)

Thus FOUR WINDS = spirits sent to the WHOLE earth, executing God's purposes universally.
