## The Argument

### 1. The Marriage Metaphor Completed

Throughout Scripture:
- **God = Husband**
- **Israel/Church = Wife**
- **Covenant = Marriage**

Within this metaphor:
| Character | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Virgin** | Faithful wife (has not committed adultery) |
| **Harlot/Whore** | Unfaithful wife (has committed adultery) |

---

### 2. Revelation 14:4 — Virgins Defined

> "These are they which were **NOT DEFILED with women**; for they are **VIRGINS**. These are they which **FOLLOW THE LAMB** whithersoever he goeth."

The "women" here are symbolic — connected to Babylon the whore and false religious systems.

**VIRGINS** = Those who:
1. Were **NOT DEFILED** (did not commit spiritual fornication)
2. **FOLLOW THE LAMB** (remain obedient to Christ)

Virgin = Faithful follower who has not committed idolatry

---

### 3. 2 Corinthians 11:2 — The Church as Virgin

> "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a **CHASTE VIRGIN to Christ**"

Paul presents the church as a "virgin" for Christ — **faithfully devoted to one master**, not having committed spiritual adultery with other gods/teachings.

---

### 4. "Virgin Daughter of Zion/Israel"

The prophets repeatedly call Israel "the VIRGIN daughter of Zion" when referring to her ideal/restored state:

| Verse | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| 2 Kings 19:21 / Isaiah 37:22 | "The **virgin** the daughter of Zion" |
| Jeremiah 31:4 | "thou shalt be built, O **virgin** of Israel" |
| Jeremiah 31:21 | "turn again, O **virgin** of Israel" |
| Lamentations 2:13 | "O **virgin** daughter of Zion" |
| Amos 5:2 | "The **virgin** of Israel is fallen" |

Israel as a "virgin" = Israel in covenant faithfulness (or called to return to it)

---

### 5. Revelation 17 — Babylon the Harlot

> "the great **WHORE** that sitteth upon many waters" (Rev 17:1)
> "BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF **HARLOTS**" (Rev 17:5)
> "the kings of the earth have committed **fornication** with her" (Rev 17:2)

Babylon = The great HARLOT = A system that leads nations into idolatry

The harlot is the **opposite** of the virgin — unfaithful, having committed fornication (idolatry).

---

### 6. Isaiah 1:21 — Faithful City Becomes Harlot

> "How is the **faithful city** become an **harlot**!"

This verse explicitly contrasts:
- **Faithful** = Virgin (the original state)
- **Harlot** = Unfaithful (the fallen state)

A city/people that was once FAITHFUL (virgin) has become a HARLOT (idolater).

---

### 7. Hosea — The Extended Metaphor

> "Go, take unto thee a wife of **whoredoms**... for the land hath committed great **whoredom**, **departing from the LORD**" (Hosea 1:2)

Hosea's unfaithful wife Gomer represents Israel as a HARLOT — having departed from the LORD.

The restoration theme in Hosea is the harlot becoming a virgin again — returning to faithful devotion.

## Relationship to Symbol Table

| Symbol | Meaning | Character |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | What to follow |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | The action of following |
| **FORNICATION** | Idolatry | The act of unfaithfulness |
| **IDOLATRY** | Self-rule | Rejecting God's word |
| **VIRGIN** | Faithful | One who has NOT committed idolatry |
| **HARLOT** | Idolater | One who HAS committed idolatry |

The pattern:
- **VIRGIN** (faithful) → commits **FORNICATION** (idolatry) → becomes **HARLOT** (idolater)
- **HARLOT** (idolater) → **REPENTS** → becomes **VIRGIN** again (restored faithfulness)

## Summary

**VIRGIN** = **Faithful** — one who has maintained exclusive devotion to God, not having committed spiritual fornication (idolatry).

**HARLOT/WHORE** = **Idolater** — one who has committed spiritual fornication, serving other gods/masters instead of remaining faithful.

They are opposites within the marriage metaphor:
- Virgin = faithful wife
- Harlot = unfaithful wife

The great contrast in Revelation:
- **Babylon the Harlot** (Rev 17) = The idolatrous system
- **The Bride/Virgin** (Rev 19, 21) = The faithful church
