# Symbol Study Methodology (For Human Study)

## Symbol Study vs Word Study — Do Not Confuse

| | **Symbol study** | **Word study** |
|---|-------------------|----------------|
| **Goal** | What does X *represent* in Scripture? (What is it a symbol *of*?) | What does this Hebrew/Greek *word* mean? (Lexical, root, usage.) |
| **Output** | Symbolic meaning: one word, two words, sentence; opposite; proof texts; substitution tests. | Etymology, root, key verses, translation range, usage patterns. |
| **Method** | Trace definitions, opposites, verbs, behavioral commands; test across the whole corpus; reject dictionary synonyms. | Strong's, concordance, root analysis, occurrence list. |
| **Used in this project** | Symbol Dictionary; methodology in this doc and AI-METHODOLOGY. | Word Study Dictionary; individual word studies (e.g. H2320 *chodesh*). |

Symbol studies answer: *What does LIGHT stand for?* (Answer: visible example / visible obedience.)  
Word studies answer: *What does the word *chodesh* mean and how is it used?* (Answer: lexical/etymological analysis.)

Use **this methodology** for **symbol studies** only. Word studies are a different task with different outputs.

## The Core Principle

> **Let Scripture Interpret Scripture**

We don't impose meanings onto biblical symbols from outside sources. Instead, we systematically examine how the Bible *itself* defines, uses, and applies each term. The symbolic meaning emerges from Scripture's own testimony.

**Do not assume consensus or tradition.** Assume they are wrong until proven independently by the text. What "most commentators say" or "what my tradition teaches" is not evidence; only Scripture's own definitions, patterns, and tests that pass in every context count.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Gather Every Occurrence

Search the Bible for every verse containing your target word. Look for:

- **Definitional verses**: Where Scripture says "X IS Y" 
- **Parallel verses**: Where the word appears alongside other concepts
- **Antithetical verses**: Where it's contrasted with its opposite
- **Behavioral commands**: Instructions like "walk in X" or "be children of X"
- **What it DOES**: Verbs and actions associated with the word

#### Why Strong's Numbers Matter

**The problem with English searches:** Translators often use different English words to translate the SAME Hebrew or Greek word. If you only search for "peace," you'll miss verses where the same Hebrew word (שָׁלוֹם *shalom*, H7965) was translated as "prosperity," "welfare," "safe," or "health."

| Hebrew Word | Strong's # | English Translations |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| שָׁלוֹם (*shalom*) | H7965 | peace, prosperity, welfare, safe, health |
| דֶּרֶךְ (*derek*) | H1870 | way, path, road, journey, manner |
| לֵב (*leb*) | H3820 | heart, mind, understanding, midst |

**The solution:** Strong's Concordance assigns a unique number to each Hebrew/Greek root word. Searching by Strong's number (like H7965) finds EVERY occurrence of that word, regardless of how it was translated into English.

**Example:** Searching English "peace" finds ~400 verses. Searching H7965 (*shalom*) finds ~250 verses where that SPECIFIC Hebrew word appears—including verses translated "welfare" or "prosperity" that an English search would miss. Conversely, some "peace" verses use DIFFERENT Hebrew words (like H7962 *shalvah*), which may have distinct meanings.

**This app's built-in search** helps you do both:
- Search by English word to find all translations
- Click any word to see its Strong's number
- Search by Strong's number (e.g., "H7965") to find all occurrences of the original word
- The Strong's panel shows you everywhere that exact Hebrew/Greek word appears

This dual approach ensures you're studying the ACTUAL biblical concept, not just one English translation of it.

### Step 2: Look for Explicit Definitions

Does Scripture directly define this symbol? Look for patterns:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "X IS Y" | "Thy word IS truth" (John 17:17) |
| "X IS like Y" | "The kingdom of heaven IS LIKE a mustard seed" |
| Christ claims to BE X | "I AM the light of the world" |

When Scripture explicitly defines something, that's your starting point.

### Step 3: Examine the Opposite

What is the explicit opposite of your symbol in Scripture?

| Symbol | Opposite | What This Reveals |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| LIGHT | Darkness | Hidden vs. visible |
| TRUTH | Lie | God's standard vs. deception |
| FAITH | Unbelief | Obedience vs. disobedience |

A word's opposite often clarifies its meaning.

### Step 4: Ask What It DOES (Not Just What It IS)

Every symbol has two dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **IS** | What is it? |
| **DOES** | What does it do? |

Don't stop at identifying what something IS—always ask what it DOES.

### Step 5: Check Who Scripture Applies It To

Ask: **"Who does Scripture say IS or DOES this thing?"**

Some symbols apply to God only, some to humans only, some to both:

| Symbol | Applied To | Examples |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| LIGHT | God AND humans | "God is light" / "Ye are the light of the world" |
| HOLY | God AND humans | "I am holy" / "Be ye holy" |
| ROCK | God/Christ primarily | "That Rock was Christ" |
| THORNS | Humans/nations only | "Thorns choke the word" |

**The test:** Your proposed meaning must work in ALL contexts where Scripture applies this symbol. If Scripture says both "God is X" and "Humans are X," your meaning must coherently apply to both. If Scripture only applies it to one, don't force it onto the other.

### Step 6: Generate Multiple Candidates

**Never stop at your first idea.** Generate at least 3-5 candidate meanings before evaluating:

1. Write down Candidate #1 (first intuition)
2. **Assume #1 is WRONG** → Generate Candidate #2 (meaningfully different)
3. **Assume #2 is WRONG** → Generate Candidate #3
4. Continue until you have multiple options
5. THEN evaluate all candidates systematically

This prevents anchoring bias—our first guess often reflects cultural assumptions, not Scripture.

### Step 7: Substitute and Test

Replace your proposed meaning in key verses. Does it still make sense?

| Verse | With "Visible Example" |
|-------|------------------------|
| "God is light" | "God is [visible example]" ✓ |
| "Ye are the light of the world" | "Ye are the [visible example] of the world" ✓ |

If substitution produces coherent meaning across diverse verses, you've found the symbolic meaning. If it breaks in ANY context, reconsider.

### Step 8: Avoid Literal Synonyms

**Critical Check:** Is your proposed meaning just a dictionary definition or synonym?

| Proposed | Test |
|----------|------|
| ROCK = "Stone" | ❌ Literal synonym |
| ROCK = "Foundation" | ❌ Still physical |
| ROCK = "Covenant" | ✓ Symbolic meaning |

**Test:** Would a secular reader using only a dictionary or thesaurus arrive at this meaning? If YES → it's not the symbolic meaning.

## Advanced Principles

### Resolve Recursive Definitions

Some symbols are defined in terms of OTHER symbols:

```
TRUTH = WORD (John 17:17)
WORD = LAW (Psalm 119:142)
LAW = God's Commandments
```

Trace chains back to the foundational concept. The recursion must terminate in something concrete.

### Trace the Production Chain

For physical symbols, ask: **"How is this made? What is it made FROM?"**

**Example: OIL**

| Stage | Physical | Symbolic |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Source | Olive Tree | Covenant Community (TREE) |
| Fruit | Olives | Works (FRUIT) |
| Process | Pressing | Trials/Testing |
| Product | Oil | **Proven Works** |

### The Redundancy Test

If a proposed meaning would create **legal redundancy** with an existing law, it is likely wrong.

**Example**: "Divorce except for fornication" (Matthew 5:32)
- Sexual adultery = death penalty under Torah (Leviticus 20:10)
- If adultery = death, you don't need divorce provisions for it
- Therefore "fornication" must mean something else: **idolatry**

### Use Parables as Symbol Keys

Parables are controlled contexts where multiple symbols appear together and Scripture often explicitly interprets them.

**Example: Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13)**

| Symbol | Jesus' Definition |
|--------|-------------------|
| SEED | "The word" (v.19) |
| GROUND | The heart |
| THORNS | "Care of this world, deceitfulness of riches" (v.22) |

Test your meanings: substitute ALL your symbol definitions into a parable. Do they work together?

## Output Format

When documenting a symbol study, include:

1. **One-word meaning** — The most concise summary
2. **Two-word meaning** — Slightly expanded
3. **Sentence meaning** — Full explanation
4. **Opposite** — What contrasts with this symbol
5. **Key proof texts** — Verses that establish the meaning
6. **Substitution test** — Showing the meaning works in context

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Example | Why It's Wrong |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Dictionary definitions | ROCK = "stone" | Not symbolic |
| Assuming consensus/tradition | "Everyone says oil = Spirit" | Assume they're wrong until proven by the text |
| Stopping at first guess | First intuition must be right | Confirmation bias |
| Single verse interpretation | One verse = one meaning | Patterns require multiple witnesses |
| Ignoring opposites | Defining LIGHT without DARKNESS | Misses half the meaning |
| Mental math | "I thought about it" | Must show work |

## Quick Reference: Ways to Test (and Search for) a Symbol's Meaning

Use these questions to probe, test, and search for a symbol's meaning:

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Is there an EXPLICIT definition? ("X IS Y") |
| 2 | What is the OPPOSITE? |
| 3 | What is COMPARED TO this symbol? |
| 4 | What VERBS accompany it? |
| 5 | Can humans BE this? |
| 6 | Is my proposed meaning a dictionary definition or synonym? |
| 7 | Are there PARADOXES? (verses that seem to contradict) |
| 8 | Does saying the word accomplish the promise? (magic word test) |
| 9 | Is this an INVOCATION symbol? (ask what RELATIONSHIP is invoked) |
| 10 | Is there a CONCENTRATED PASSAGE? (word appears many times) |
| 11 | Does this word seem OUT OF PLACE? (incongruity = intentional) |
| 12 | Would proposed meaning create LEGAL REDUNDANCY? |
| 13 | HOW IS THIS THING MADE? (trace production chain) |

## Remember

> "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter." — Proverbs 25:2

The goal is not to impose meaning but to **DISCOVER** what Scripture itself reveals. When multiple lines of evidence converge—explicit definitions, opposites, functional analysis, and substitution tests all agree—you can be confident you've found the symbolic meaning.
