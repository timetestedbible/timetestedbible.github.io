## Methodology Notes

When studying each symbol:
1. Follow the methodology in `/symbols/methodology.md`
2. Resolve all symbolic recursion to concrete concepts
3. Test against all occurrences (not just samples)
4. Distinguish definite ("THE X") from indefinite ("a X") where applicable
5. Check for related multi-word phrases (e.g., "four winds" vs. "wind")
