# BREAD — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Word |
| **Two Words** | Word of God |
| **Sentence** | God's instruction that sustains spiritual life — Torah, the words from His mouth that man must live by |

**Opposite**: Hunger = Lack of God's Word (Amos 8:11)

## Strong's Numbers

**Hebrew**: לֶחֶם (*lechem*, H3899) — food, bread, grain

**Greek**: ἄρτος (*ártos*, G740) — bread, loaf

---

## The Definitional Text — Deuteronomy 8:3

> "And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that **man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live**."

This is the explicit definition:
- Physical bread sustains physical life
- **Word of God** sustains true life
- The contrast reveals: BREAD symbolically = WORD OF GOD

Jesus quotes this as His first response to temptation:

> **Matthew 4:4** — "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by **every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God**."

---

## Manna = Test of Torah Obedience

The manna itself was explicitly a test of walking in Torah:

> **Exodus 16:4** — "Behold, I will rain **bread** from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, **that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law (H8451 torah), or no**."

The bread from heaven tested whether Israel would obey God's instructions — gather the right amount, rest on Sabbath, follow the pattern given. The manna was a tangible Torah lesson.

## Jesus: The Bread of Life

> **John 6:35** — "I am the **bread of life**: he that cometh to me shall never hunger"

> **John 6:48** — "I am that **bread of life**"

> **John 6:51** — "I am the **living bread** which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh"

Jesus identifies Himself as the bread. But what does this mean? He explains:

> **John 6:63** — "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: **the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life**."

The "flesh" he gives is His **words** — His teaching, His instruction. To eat His flesh is to consume His words.

This connects to John 1:

> **John 1:1** — "In the beginning was the **Word**, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."

> **John 1:14** — "And the **Word was made flesh**, and dwelt among us"

Jesus IS the Word made flesh — Torah incarnate. To eat the Bread of Life is to receive His words/instructions.

## The Chain

| Symbol | Meaning | Scripture |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Physical bread** | Physical sustenance | (literal) |
| **Bread from heaven (manna)** | Test of Torah obedience | Exodus 16:4 |
| **Word from God's mouth** | What man truly lives by | Deuteronomy 8:3 |
| **Jesus (Bread of Life)** | The Word made flesh | John 6:35, 1:14 |
| **His words** | Spirit and life | John 6:63 |

BREAD = WORD OF GOD = Torah/God's instruction

---

## Labour for the Right Bread

> **John 6:27** — "Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life"

Physical bread perishes. Spiritual bread (God's Word) endures forever.

---

## The Shewbread / Bread of Presence

The tabernacle had the "bread of presence" (shewbread) on the table:

> **Exodus 25:30** — "And thou shalt set upon the table **shewbread** before me alway."

This bread was in God's presence continually — symbolizing that God's Word is always available to His people. The priests ate it, sustaining themselves on what came from God's presence.

> **1 Chronicles 9:32** — "other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the **shewbread**, to prepare it every **sabbath**."

Prepared every Sabbath — the day of rest and hearing God's Word.

## Breaking/Cutting Bread = Cutting Covenant

The Hebrew phrase for making a covenant is כָּרַת בְּרִית (*karat berit*) — literally "to **CUT** a covenant." Covenants were ratified by cutting animals and passing between the pieces (Genesis 15:9-18).

If BREAD = Word of God = **terms of covenant**, then:

**CUTTING/BREAKING BREAD = ENTERING COVENANT**

To share in the cut bread is to share in the covenant — agreeing to its terms together.

At the Last Supper, Jesus:
- Cuts/breaks the bread (the Word/terms)
- Says "this is the new covenant in my blood" (Luke 22:20)
- Participants eat = accept the covenant terms

This mirrors the original covenant ratification at Sinai:

> **Exodus 24:11** — "they **saw God, and did eat and drink**"

After Israel received the Torah (the covenant terms) and ratified the covenant with blood (Exodus 24:8), the elders ate and drank in God's presence. The meal WAS the covenant ceremony.

When believers "break bread together" (Acts 2:42, 46), they are not merely eating or even just teaching — they are **renewing covenant** around God's Word.

> **Acts 2:42** — "And they continued stedfastly in the **apostles' doctrine** and fellowship, and in **breaking of bread**, and in prayers."

Doctrine AND breaking bread — receiving the covenant terms AND ratifying them together.

---

## The Famine of the Word

> **Amos 8:11** — "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a **famine** in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of **hearing the words of the LORD**"

The opposite of bread is famine. A famine of bread = famine of hearing God's words.

---

## Unleavened Bread

Unleavened bread (matzah, H4682) removes the leaven (symbolic of sin/hypocrisy). It represents pure, unadulterated Word — Torah without the additions of men.

> **Matthew 16:6** — "Take heed and beware of the **leaven** of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees"

> **Matthew 16:12** — "Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the **doctrine** of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees"

LEAVEN = false doctrine. UNLEAVENED BREAD = pure Word.

---

## Related Symbols

- **WORD** — The instruction of God (= bread)
- **MANNA** — Bread from heaven; test of Torah obedience
- **LEAVEN** — False doctrine / sin (what corrupts bread)
- **WATER** — Often paired with bread; may represent Spirit or cleansing
- **WINE** — Paired with bread in communion; blood of covenant

---

## Summary

**BREAD** = **WORD OF GOD**

God's instruction that sustains spiritual life. Physical bread sustains the body; the Word from God's mouth sustains the soul. Jesus, as the Bread of Life, is the Word made flesh — and His words are spirit and life.

> "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God."
