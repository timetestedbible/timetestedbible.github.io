# HIGHWAY

**Hebrew**: מְסִלָּה (*mesillah*, H4546) — from H5549 (*salal*), "to mound up, cast up, exalt"  
**Greek**: ὁδός (*hodos*, G3598) — "a way, road, journey"

## The Raised Path

The Hebrew *mesillah* derives from the root meaning "to raise up" or "to cast up a mound." A highway is not merely a road but an *elevated* path—raised above the common ground, prepared for travel, cleared of obstacles. This physical characteristic carries profound symbolic weight throughout Scripture.

## The Way of Holiness

Isaiah names the highway explicitly:

> "And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein." (Isaiah 35:8)

The highway is the path of the *qadosh*—the set-apart, the sanctified. Those walking in covenant faithfulness travel this raised way; the unclean (those outside covenant obedience) cannot pass over it. The distinction is absolute: the highway separates those who walk with God from those who do not.

## Preparing the Way

When Isaiah prophesies of one crying in the wilderness, "Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God" (Isaiah 40:3), John the Baptist fulfills this by calling Israel to *repentance* (Matthew 3:1-3). The highway is prepared not by physical construction but by turning hearts back to covenant faithfulness. Every valley exalted and every mountain made low represents the removal of obstacles to obedience.

## The Highway and Covenant

The connection between highway and covenant appears starkly in Isaiah 33:8:

> "The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man."

When covenant is broken, the highways lie waste. The path of faithfulness becomes desolate. This parallel confirms that the highway symbolizes covenant faithfulness itself—when one is abandoned, so is the other.

## The Highway of the Upright

Proverbs establishes the moral dimension:

> "The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul." (Proverbs 16:17)

The highway is defined by its direction: *away from evil*. This is not a neutral path but a trajectory of righteousness. Those who travel it are those who keep covenant by departing from transgression.

## Finding Guests on the Highway

In the parable of the wedding feast (Matthew 22:1-14), the king sends servants "into the highways" to find guests after the original invitees refuse:

> "Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage." (Matthew 22:9)

The original guests—representing the religious establishment—rejected the invitation. But those found *on the highways* are those already walking in covenant faithfulness. The king does not send servants to the byways or the hedges of lawlessness but to where the faithful walk. The tax collectors and sinners who received Christ were, paradoxically, more faithful to the covenant's heart than those who claimed its guardianship.

## The Highway for the Remnant

Isaiah prophesies a highway for the returning remnant:

> "And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt." (Isaiah 11:16)

As Israel walked out of Egypt through the sea on dry ground, so the remnant returns on a highway prepared by God. The highway is the covenant path—the way of exodus, of deliverance, of return to the LORD.

## Highway and Way: Location and Conduct

Scripture distinguishes between HIGHWAY (*mesillah*) and WAY (*derek*):

| Symbol | Hebrew | Meaning | Aspect |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **HIGHWAY** | *mesillah* (H4546) | Covenant Path | WHERE you walk |
| **WAY** | *derek* (H1870) | Conduct | HOW you walk |

The highway is the **location**—the raised, prepared path of covenant faithfulness. The way is the **manner**—the conduct with which one walks. Both must align: one must walk *on* the highway *in* the right way.

Isaiah 35:8 brings both together:

> "And an highway shall be there, **and a way**, and it shall be called The way of holiness."

The highway provides the path; the way defines the conduct upon it. The "way of holiness" is both a location (the covenant path) and a manner (sanctified conduct).

Consider Proverbs 16:17:

> "The **highway** of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his **way** preserveth his soul."

The highway (location) of the upright is defined by departure from evil. The way (conduct) that one keeps preserves the soul. Location and conduct are inseparable.
