## The Key: EXPLICIT DEFINITIONS

### Proverbs 6:23 — Direct Equation

> "For the **commandment** is a **lamp**; and the **law** is **light**; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life"

This is an explicit symbolic definition:
- **LAMP = COMMANDMENT**
- **LIGHT = LAW**

### Psalm 119:105 — Word = Lamp

> "Thy **word** is a **lamp** unto my feet, and a **light** unto my path"

The WORD (God's instruction/commandment) IS the lamp that guides.

## Production Chain Analysis

**How does a lamp work?**

1. **LAMP** (the vessel/container) — holds the oil
2. **OIL** (the fuel) — provides the substance to burn
3. **LIGHT** (the result) — visible illumination

**Symbolic Chain:**

| Physical | Symbolic | Evidence |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **LAMP** | Commandment | Proverbs 6:23 |
| **OIL** | Proven Works | Symbol Dictionary |
| **LIGHT** | Visible Example | Symbol Dictionary |

**The equation:**
> LAMP (Commandment) + OIL (Proven Works) = LIGHT (Visible Example)

If you have the commandment but don't DO it (no oil), the lamp goes out (no visible example).

## Parable of Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13)

| Element | Physical | Symbolic |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **10 Virgins** | Covenant people | Faithful ones awaiting the bridegroom |
| **Lamps** | Oil lamps | Commandments (God's word) |
| **Oil** | Olive oil | Proven Works (built through obedience) |
| **Wise** | Had oil with lamps | Had commandments AND proven works |
| **Foolish** | Had lamps, no oil | Had commandments but NO proven works |
| **Lamps going out** | Fire extinguished | No visible example due to lack of works |

### The Parable Decoded

**Matthew 25:3** — "They that were **foolish** took their **lamps**, and took **no oil** with them"
- They HAD the commandments (lamps)
- They did NOT have proven works (oil)
- This is the person who HEARS but does NOT DO (disobedient)

**Matthew 25:4** — "But the **wise** took **oil** in their vessels with their **lamps**"
- They HAD the commandments (lamps)
- They ALSO had proven works (oil)
- This is the person who hears AND does (obedient)

**Matthew 25:8** — "Our **lamps are gone out**"
- Without oil (proven works), the lamp produces no light
- Knowing the commandment without doing it = no visible example
- "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:17)

## Tabernacle Connection

The **golden lampstand** (menorah) in the tabernacle:

| Detail | Reference | Significance |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| **Seven lamps** | Exodus 25:37 | Complete illumination |
| **Pure olive oil** | Exodus 27:20, Leviticus 24:2 | Beaten/pressed oil = proven works |
| **Burn continually** | Exodus 27:20, Leviticus 24:2 | Perpetual example |
| **Before the LORD** | Leviticus 24:4 | Visible to God |

The priests were responsible to keep the lamps burning — this required continual supply of oil. The commandments (lamps) require continual obedient action (oil) to produce light (example).

## Connection to Symbol Web

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to LAMP |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard / Commandments | LAMP = TRUTH (same meaning) |
| **LIGHT** | Visible Example | LAMP produces LIGHT when fueled |
| **OIL** | Proven Works | OIL fuels the LAMP |
| **WISE** | Obedient | WISE has lamp with oil |
| **FOOL** | Disobedient | FOOL has lamp without oil |

## Additional Evidence

### 2 Samuel 22:29 — The LORD is My Lamp

> "For thou art my **lamp**, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness"

The LORD Himself — His word, His instruction, His standard — is the lamp that illuminates.

### Proverbs 13:9 — Lamp of the Wicked Put Out

> "The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the **lamp of the wicked** shall be **put out**"

The wicked's lamp (their claim to know commandments) is extinguished because they have no oil (no works of obedience).

### Proverbs 20:20 — Cursing Parents = Lamp Put Out

> "Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his **lamp** shall be **put out** in obscure darkness"

Disobedience to parents (breaking commandment) results in the lamp being extinguished.

### 2 Chronicles 21:7 — A Light for David

> "the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a **light** (H5216 - ner/lamp) to him and to his sons for ever"

The "lamp" given to David is the continuing covenant — the commandment/word preserved.

## Substitution Test

| Verse | Original | With "Commandment" |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Proverbs 6:23 | "the commandment is a **lamp**" | (Direct definition) ✓ |
| Psalm 119:105 | "Thy word is a **lamp** unto my feet" | "Thy word is a **commandment** unto my feet" ✓ |
| Matthew 25:3 | "took their **lamps**, and took no oil" | "took their **commandments**, and took no works" ✓ |
| Matthew 25:8 | "our **lamps** are gone out" | "our **commandments** produce no light" ✓ |
| Proverbs 13:9 | "the **lamp** of the wicked shall be put out" | "the **commandment** of the wicked produces no light" ✓ |
| 2 Sam 22:29 | "thou art my **lamp**, O LORD" | "thou art my **commandment/instruction**, O LORD" ✓ |

**All substitutions work coherently.**

## The Complete Picture

| Element | Symbol | Meaning | Evidence |
|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| **LAMP** | Vessel | Commandment / Word | Proverbs 6:23, Psalm 119:105 |
| **OIL** | Fuel | Proven Works | Symbol Dictionary |
| **LIGHT** | Result | Visible Example | Symbol Dictionary |
| **WISE** | Has lamp + oil | Obedient (commandment + works) | Matthew 25:4 |
| **FOOL** | Has lamp, no oil | Disobedient (commandment, no works) | Matthew 25:3 |

**The lesson:** Having the commandment (lamp) is not enough. You must DO the commandment (add oil) to produce a visible example (light).

This is why "faith without works is dead" — the lamp without oil produces no light.

---

## Summary

**LAMP** symbolically represents **COMMANDMENT** — God's word/instruction that provides direction for life.

The lamp requires OIL (proven works) to produce LIGHT (visible example). Having the commandment without doing it is like having a lamp without oil — it produces nothing.

This connects:
- **TRUTH** = Commandment (God's Standard)
- **LAMP** = Commandment (same meaning, different metaphor)
- **LIGHT** = Visible Example (what the lamp produces)
- **OIL** = Proven Works (the fuel)
- **WISE** = Obedient (has lamp + oil)
- **FOOL** = Disobedient (has lamp, no oil)

---

## Confidence Level: HIGH

The meaning "Commandment" is:
1. ✓ **Explicitly defined** by Proverbs 6:23 ("the commandment IS a lamp")
2. ✓ Confirmed by Psalm 119:105 ("thy word is a lamp")
3. ✓ Coherent with production chain (lamp + oil = light)
4. ✓ Perfectly explains Parable of Ten Virgins
5. ✓ Consistent with existing symbol web
