## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly identifies Jerusalem as more than a geographic location — it is a **person**, a **bride**, a **mother**:

- **Galatians 4:26** — "But **Jerusalem which is above** is free, which is the **mother** of us all"
- **Revelation 21:2** — "the holy city, **new Jerusalem**, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a **bride** adorned for her husband"
- **Revelation 21:9-10** — "Come hither, I will shew thee the **bride**, the Lamb's wife. And he... shewed me that great city, the holy **Jerusalem**"
- **Hebrews 12:22-23** — "Ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the **heavenly Jerusalem**, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the **general assembly** and church of the firstborn"

The heavenly Jerusalem IS the bride. The bride IS the covenant community — the "general assembly and church of the firstborn." Jerusalem is not ultimately a city of stones but a city of people.

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What does Jerusalem DO in Scripture?

| Function | Verse | Significance |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Where God dwells** | Zechariah 2:10 — "I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee" | God's dwelling is among His people |
| **Where God's name is** | 2 Chronicles 6:6 — "I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there" | His character/authority resides in His people |
| **The throne of the LORD** | Jeremiah 3:17 — "they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD" | His rule is exercised through His people |
| **A mother** | Galatians 4:26 — "the mother of us all" | The covenant community produces children |
| **A bride** | Revelation 21:2 — "prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" | In covenant/marriage relationship with God |
| **A place of teaching** | Isaiah 2:3 — "out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem" | Torah/instruction flows from the community |
| **A place of joy** | Isaiah 65:18-19 — "I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy" | Note: Jerusalem IS identified with "her people" |

### 3. The Behavioral Evidence

How are we commanded to relate to Jerusalem?

- **Pray for it**: Psalm 122:6 — "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee"
- **Never forget it**: Psalm 137:5-6 — "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning"
- **Rejoice with it**: Isaiah 66:10 — "Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her"
- **Be comforted in it**: Isaiah 66:13 — "As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem"

If Jerusalem is only a physical city, "being comforted IN Jerusalem" is geographic. If Jerusalem is the covenant community, "being comforted in Jerusalem" means being comforted among God's people — which is how comfort actually works.

### 4. The Antithetical Evidence

Jerusalem's opposite is consistently **Babylon**:

| Jerusalem | Babylon |
|-----------|---------|
| The bride (Revelation 21:2) | The harlot (Revelation 17:1-5) |
| The holy city (Revelation 21:10) | The great city (Revelation 17:18) |
| Free (Galatians 4:26) | Bondage (Galatians 4:25) |
| Comes down from God (Rev 21:2) | Falls from power (Rev 18:2) |
| People of the covenant | People of the world system |
| Mother of the faithful (Gal 4:26) | Mother of harlots (Rev 17:5) |

If BABYLON = the world system / false covenant community (see [BABYLON study](/reader/symbols/BABYLON)), then JERUSALEM = God's covenant community / the true bride.

### 5. The Human Application Test

Can humans BE Jerusalem? **YES** — this is explicit:

- **Hebrews 12:22** — "Ye **are come** unto... the heavenly Jerusalem" — believers are part of it NOW
- **Galatians 4:26** — "Jerusalem which is above... the mother of us all" — we are her children
- **Revelation 21:2** — The new Jerusalem is "prepared as a bride" — the community of the redeemed
- **Psalm 87:5-6** — "of Zion it shall be said, This and that man **was born in her**" — individuals are born into Zion/Jerusalem

### 6. The Two Jerusalems

Paul makes the dual nature explicit in Galatians 4:25-26:

> "For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to **Jerusalem which now is**, and is in bondage with her children. But **Jerusalem which is above** is free, which is the mother of us all."

There are two Jerusalems:

| | Jerusalem Below | Jerusalem Above |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | The physical city / earthly system | The heavenly community / bride |
| **Status** | In bondage (Gal 4:25) | Free (Gal 4:26) |
| **Corresponds to** | Hagar / Sinai / law as bondage | Sarah / promise / freedom |
| **Children** | Those under the old system | All who are of faith |

The physical city is a **shadow** of the heavenly reality. When Scripture prophesies about "Jerusalem," the question is always: which Jerusalem? The answer often involves both — the physical as a sign, the spiritual as the substance.

### 7. Jerusalem Named as a Bride

The marriage imagery is explicit:

- **Isaiah 54:5** — "For thy Maker is thine **husband**; the LORD of hosts is his name"
- **Isaiah 62:4-5** — "thou shalt be called **Hephzibah** [my delight is in her], and thy land **Beulah** [married]... as the **bridegroom** rejoiceth over the **bride**, so shall thy God rejoice over thee"
- **Revelation 21:2** — "prepared as a **bride** adorned for her **husband**"
- **Revelation 21:9** — "Come hither, I will shew thee the **bride, the Lamb's wife**... the holy Jerusalem"

Jerusalem IS the bride. The bride IS the covenant community. When Daniel 9:24 says the prophecy is determined upon "thy holy city," it is determined upon the covenant community — the people who will ultimately be the bride of the Lamb.

## Key Proof Texts

### 1. Revelation 21:2-10 — Jerusalem IS the Bride

> "I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a **bride** adorned for her husband."

> "Come hither, I will shew thee the **bride**, the Lamb's wife. And he... shewed me that great city, the holy **Jerusalem**."

The angel says "I'll show you the bride" and shows John Jerusalem. They are the same thing.

### 2. Galatians 4:25-26 — Two Jerusalems

> "Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem which is **above** is **free**, which is the **mother** of us all."

The heavenly Jerusalem is a person — a mother. She has children. She is free. The earthly Jerusalem is her shadow.

### 3. Hebrews 12:22-23 — We Have Already Come to Jerusalem

> "Ye **are come** unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the **general assembly** and church of the firstborn."

The heavenly Jerusalem IS the "general assembly and church of the firstborn." Believers have already arrived — not geographically, but covenantally.

### 4. Isaiah 62:4-5 — Jerusalem Married to God

> "Thou shalt be called Hephzibah [my delight is in her]... as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee."

The marriage metaphor is not an illustration — it is the identity. Jerusalem is the bride. God is the bridegroom.

## Substitution Test

| Verse | With "Covenant Community / Bride" |
|-------|----------------------------------|
| "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem" (Ps 122:6) | "Pray for the peace of [the covenant community]" ✓ |
| "Jerusalem which is above is free, the mother of us all" (Gal 4:26) | "[The covenant community] which is above is free, the mother of us all" ✓ |
| "the holy city, new Jerusalem... prepared as a bride" (Rev 21:2) | "the holy [community], new [bride]... prepared as a bride" ✓ (tautological — confirms identity) |
| "out of Zion shall go forth the law" (Isa 2:3) | "out of [the covenant community] shall go forth the law" ✓ |
| "I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy" (Isa 65:18) | "I create [the covenant community] a rejoicing, and her people a joy" ✓ |
| "they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD" (Jer 3:17) | "they shall call [the covenant community] the throne of the LORD" ✓ |
| "Seventy sevens are determined upon... thy holy city" (Dan 9:24) | "Seventy sevens are determined upon... [the covenant community]" ✓ |
| "the people of the prince shall destroy the city and the sanctuary" (Dan 9:26 traditional) | "the people of the prince shall destroy [the covenant community] and the sanctuary" ✓ |

## Connection to Daniel 9

When Daniel 9:24 says the seventy sevens are determined upon "**thy people** and upon **thy holy city**," and we understand that:

- "Thy people" = the seed of Abraham (see [Daniel 9 study](/reader/verse-studies/DANIEL-9))
- "Thy holy city" = Jerusalem = the covenant community / the bride

...then the prophecy is not merely about a physical city being rebuilt. It is about the full arc of the covenant community — from Abraham's call to the marriage supper of the Lamb, when the bride is finally "prepared" and the new Jerusalem descends from heaven (Revelation 21:2).

This is why six items must be accomplished: finish transgression, end sins, reconcile iniquity, bring everlasting righteousness, seal vision and prophecy, anoint the most holy. These are not about a building. They are about a bride being made ready.

## Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to Jerusalem |
|--------|---------|--------------------------|
| **BABYLON** | World system / false bride | The opposite — the harlot vs. the bride |
| **MOUNTAIN** | Kingdom/Government | "Mount Zion" — Jerusalem is the holy mountain, the seat of God's kingdom |
| **MARRIAGE** | Covenant | Jerusalem is the bride in the marriage covenant |
| **ROCK** | Covenant | The foundation of the covenant community |
| **LIGHT** | Visible Example | Rev 21:23 — "the glory of God did lighten it" — the community shines |

---

## Conclusion

**JERUSALEM** symbolically represents the **covenant community** — the gathered people of God in relationship with Him. Ultimately, Jerusalem is the **bride** — the Lamb's wife, the general assembly and church of the firstborn, prepared for the marriage supper.

This meaning works for:
- **The physical city**: A shadow and sign of the heavenly reality
- **The heavenly Jerusalem**: The actual community of the redeemed (Hebrews 12:22)
- **The new Jerusalem**: The bride descending from heaven, the consummation of all things (Revelation 21:2)
- **Daniel's prophecy**: "Thy holy city" = the covenant community upon whom the seventy sevens are determined

Jerusalem is not ultimately made of stones. It is made of people.
