# SHEPHERD — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Overseer |
| **Two Words** | Covenant Caretaker |
| **Sentence** | One entrusted with the care and feeding of God's people — a ruler who leads by example, teaches covenant truth, protects the flock at personal cost, and seeks the lost |

**Opposite**: Hireling / Idol Shepherd = Self-serving leader who exploits rather than serves

## Key Strong's Numbers

| Word | Strong's | Definition | KJV Translations |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|
| רָעָה (*ra'ah*) | H7462 | "to tend a flock; i.e. pasture it; generally to **rule**; by extension, to **associate with** (as a friend)" | shepherd, feed, pastor, herdman, companion, keep company with, friend |
| רֹעִי (*ro'iy*) | H7473 | "pastoral; as noun, a shepherd" (from H7462) | shepherd |
| ποιμήν (*poimen*) | G4166 | "a shepherd (literally or figuratively)" | shepherd, **pastor** |
| ποιμαίνω (*poimaino*) | G4165 | "to tend as a shepherd; (figuratively) supervise" | feed, rule |
| ἀρχιποίμην (*archipoimen*) | G750 | "a head shepherd" | chief shepherd |

**Critical observation**: The Hebrew root H7462 combines **feeding/ruling** with **companionship** — the shepherd is not a distant ruler but one who walks *with* the flock. And "pastor" (Jer 23:1, Eph 4:11) is the **exact same word** as "shepherd" — they are not different roles.

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence — God/Christ IS the Shepherd

Scripture explicitly identifies both God and Christ as shepherd:

- **Psalm 23:1** — "The LORD **is** my shepherd; I shall not want"
- **Psalm 80:1** — "Give ear, O **Shepherd of Israel**, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock"
- **John 10:11** — "**I am** the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep"
- **John 10:14** — "**I am** the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine"
- **Hebrews 13:20** — "that great **shepherd** of the sheep, through the blood of the **everlasting covenant**"
- **1 Peter 2:25** — "the **Shepherd** and **Bishop** of your souls"
- **Genesis 49:24** — "from thence is the **shepherd**, the **stone** of Israel" — a Messianic title linking shepherd to stone (see ROCK = Covenant)
- **Isaiah 40:11** — "He shall feed his flock **like a shepherd**: he shall gather the lambs with his arm"

The dual identification — God IS shepherd, Christ IS shepherd — means the symbolic meaning must coherently apply to divine care of the covenant people.

### 2. The Human Application — Can Humans BE Shepherds?

**YES** — and this is where the good/bad distinction becomes critical:

- **Ephesians 4:11** — "he gave some... **pastors** [G4166, same word as shepherd] and teachers" — a gift to the church
- **1 Peter 5:1-4** — Elders told to "**Feed** the flock of God... being **ensamples** to the flock. And when the **chief Shepherd** shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory"
- **Jeremiah 23:4** — "I will set up **shepherds** over them which shall **feed** them"
- **Ezekiel 34:23** — "I will set up **one shepherd** over them... my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be **their shepherd**"
- **2 Samuel 5:2** — "Thou shalt **feed** [H7462] my people Israel, and thou shalt be a **captain** over Israel"

Human shepherds are appointed **under** the chief Shepherd (Christ). Their role is derivative — they tend God's flock on God's behalf.

### 3. The Functional Evidence — What a Shepherd DOES

| Function | Key Verse |
|----------|-----------|
| **Feeds** (teaches/provides) | Ezek 34:2, John 21:16-17, 1 Pet 5:2, Jer 23:4 |
| **Leads / goes before** | John 10:4, Ps 23:2-3 |
| **Knows sheep by name** | John 10:3, 14, 27 |
| **Gives his life for the sheep** | John 10:11, 15 |
| **Seeks the lost** | Ezek 34:12, 16; Luke 15:4-6 |
| **Binds the broken, strengthens the sick** | Ezek 34:4, 16 |
| **Gathers** | Isa 40:11, Jer 31:10, Ezek 34:13 |
| **Is an example** to the flock | 1 Pet 5:3 |
| **Protects** from wolves/beasts | John 10:12, 1 Sam 17:34-35 |
| **Causes them to lie down** (gives rest) | Ezek 34:15, Ps 23:2 |

Note: "Feed" in Hebrew (H7462) and "rule" are the same word. The shepherd's authority IS the act of feeding/providing — not domination but provision.

### 4. The Good Shepherd vs. Bad Shepherds — The Central Contrast

This is the heart of the study. **Ezekiel 34** is the concentrated passage — God's comprehensive indictment of Israel's shepherds, followed by His promise to shepherd them Himself.

#### The Good Shepherd (Ezekiel 34:11-16, John 10:1-16, 1 Peter 5:1-4)

| Action | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Feeds the flock | Ezek 34:13-14, Jer 23:4, John 21:16-17 |
| Gives his life for the sheep | John 10:11, 15 |
| Seeks the lost, brings back the driven | Ezek 34:16, Luke 15:4-6 |
| Binds up the broken, strengthens the sick | Ezek 34:16 |
| Enters by the door (legitimate authority) | John 10:1-2 |
| Calls them by name (personal knowledge) | John 10:3 |
| Goes before them (leads by example) | John 10:4, 1 Pet 5:3 |
| Serves willingly, not for money | 1 Pet 5:2 |
| Not lording over, but being ensamples | 1 Pet 5:3 |

#### The Bad Shepherds (Ezekiel 34:2-6, Zechariah 11:15-17, Jeremiah 23:1-2, John 10:12-13)

| Action | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Feed THEMSELVES, not the flock | Ezek 34:2-3 |
| Don't strengthen the diseased | Ezek 34:4 |
| Don't heal the sick | Ezek 34:4 |
| Don't bind up the broken | Ezek 34:4 |
| Don't bring back the driven away | Ezek 34:4 |
| Don't seek the lost | Ezek 34:4, Zech 11:16 |
| Rule with force and cruelty | Ezek 34:4 |
| Scatter the flock | Jer 23:1-2, Ezek 34:5-6 |
| Are hirelings — flee from danger | John 10:12-13 |
| Cause sheep to go astray | Jer 50:6 |
| Look to their own way, for own gain | Isa 56:11 |
| Eat the flesh of the fat | Zech 11:16 |
| "Idol shepherd" that leaveth the flock | Zech 11:17 |
| "Foolish shepherd" | Zech 11:15 |
| Pity them not | Zech 11:5 |
| Slumber (negligent) | Nah 3:18 |

#### The Pattern

The distinction reduces to a single principle:

- **Good shepherd**: self-sacrificing — gives life **FOR** the sheep
- **Bad shepherd**: self-serving — takes life **FROM** the sheep
- **Good shepherd**: **feeds** (gives truth/provision)
- **Bad shepherd**: **feeds on** (exploits/consumes)

Ezekiel 34:2 captures it perfectly: "Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do **feed themselves**! should not the shepherds **feed the flocks**?"

### 5. The Antithetical Evidence — Hireling vs. Shepherd

John 10:12-13 introduces the **hireling** as the direct opposite:

| Shepherd | Hireling |
|----------|----------|
| Owns the sheep | Sheep are not his own |
| Gives his life | Flees from danger |
| Stays with the flock | Leaves the sheep |
| Cares for the sheep | "Careth not for the sheep" |

The hireling's failure is not active cruelty — it is **lack of ownership and care**. He works for wages, not relationship. This maps to leadership motivated by gain (1 Pet 5:2: "not for filthy lucre") vs. leadership motivated by covenant love.

### 6. Why "Covenant Caretaker" and Not Other Meanings?

**Candidates considered:**

| Candidate | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| "Ruler" | Too broad; misses the feeding/care dimension (a tyrant rules too) |
| "Leader" | Too generic; secular reader would arrive here |
| "Teacher" | Misses the protection and seeking functions |
| "Guardian" | Misses the feeding/teaching function |
| "Covenant Caretaker" | Captures all functions: feeds (covenant truth), leads (covenant path), protects, seeks, heals — all within a covenant framework |

**Why "covenant" specifically?**

- **Hebrews 13:20** — "that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the **everlasting covenant**" — the shepherd role is explicitly tied to the covenant
- **Ezekiel 34:25** — After promising the one shepherd (v.23), God says: "I will make with them a **covenant** of peace"
- **Genesis 49:24** — "the shepherd, the **stone** of Israel" — stone/rock = Covenant (see ROCK study)
- The shepherd feeds covenant truth, leads in the covenant path, and protects the covenant people

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Ezekiel 34:2-4, 11-16, 23** — The definitive passage: God indicts bad shepherds who feed themselves, then promises to shepherd His people Himself, and finally appoints "one shepherd... my servant David." Contains the complete job description of both good and bad shepherds.

2. **John 10:1-16** — Jesus' "I am the good shepherd" discourse. Defines the shepherd by: entering legitimately (v.1-2), calling sheep by name (v.3), going before them (v.4), giving his life (v.11,15), knowing them (v.14), gathering others into one fold (v.16). Contrasts with thieves (v.1,8,10) and hirelings (v.12-13).

3. **1 Peter 5:1-4** — The pastoral mandate: feed the flock, take oversight willingly (not for money), be examples (not lords), and expect accountability to the chief Shepherd.

4. **Psalm 23** — The shepherd's provision in miniature: rest (v.2), guidance in right paths (v.3), protection through danger (v.4), provision before enemies (v.5), goodness and mercy following (v.6).

5. **Hebrews 13:20** — The covenant connection: "the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the **everlasting covenant**."

## Conclusion

**SHEPHERD** symbolically represents **Covenant Caretaker** — one entrusted with the care, feeding, leading, and protection of God's covenant people.

This is why:
- God IS the shepherd (He IS the covenant-keeper)
- Christ IS the good shepherd (He IS the covenant mediator — Heb 8:6)
- Pastors/elders ARE shepherds (appointed under the chief Shepherd to care for His people)
- Bad shepherds are indicted for feeding THEMSELVES instead of the flock (covenant exploitation)
- The hireling fails because he has no covenant relationship — no ownership, no cost

The entire shepherd framework is covenant-structured: the shepherd tends, the sheep follow, and the relationship is binding. When shepherds break this trust, God Himself intervenes to shepherd directly (Ezek 34:11) and appoints the one true Shepherd (Ezek 34:23, John 10:16).
