# FAITH — Word Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Obedience |
| **Two Words** | Trusting Obedience |
| **Sentence** | Acting on what you believe to be true — trust that produces obedient action, not mere mental assent |

**Opposite**: Unbelief = Disobedience / Refusal to act on God's word

## The Argument

### 1. The Biblical Definition

> **Hebrews 11:1** — "Now faith is the **substance** (G5287 hypostasis - assurance/confidence) of things hoped for, the **evidence** (G1650 elegchos - proof/conviction) of things not seen."

Faith is:
- The ASSURANCE/CONFIDENCE in what is hoped for
- The EVIDENCE/PROOF of unseen realities

But this definition alone doesn't capture the full picture...

### 2. Faith Requires Works/Action

James 2 makes clear that faith is not passive belief:

| Verse | Statement |
|-------|-----------|
| James 2:17 | "faith, if it hath not works, is **dead**" |
| James 2:18 | "I will shew thee my faith **BY** my works" |
| James 2:20 | "faith **without works** is dead" |
| James 2:22 | "faith **wrought with** his works, and by works was faith made **perfect**" |
| James 2:26 | "as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead" |

**Key Insight**: The demons "believe" there is one God (James 2:19) — but that's not saving faith. True faith produces ACTION.

### 3. Faith = Obedience

Scripture explicitly connects faith with obedience:

| Verse | Phrase |
|-------|--------|
| Romans 1:5 | "**obedience to** the faith" |
| Romans 16:26 | "**obedience of** faith" |

The phrase "obedience of faith" suggests that faith's very nature IS obedience — trusting obedience to God's word.

### 4. Hebrew Insight: Emunah

The Hebrew word אֱמוּנָה (emunah, H530), used in Habakkuk 2:4 ("the just shall live by his faith"), means:
- Faithfulness
- Steadfastness
- Reliability
- Firmness

The root אָמַן (aman) means "to be firm, to support, to be faithful."

In Hebrew thought, faith is not primarily mental assent but **steadfast, faithful action** — consistently living according to what you trust.

### 5. "Thy Faith Hath Made Thee Whole"

When Jesus said "thy faith hath made thee whole" (Matt 9:22, Mark 5:34, Luke 8:48, etc.), the person had **acted** on their belief:
- The woman touched His garment
- The centurion came to Jesus
- The blind man cried out and followed

Faith was demonstrated BY action.

### 6. Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to Faith |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard/Commandments | What we obey |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | Our response to Truth |
| **LIGHT** | Visible Example | Faith produces visible obedience |

"Doing truth" (keeping God's commandments) is the ACTION of faith.

## Substitution Test

| Verse | Original | With "Obedience/Trusting Obedience" |
|-------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Hab 2:4 | "The just shall live by his faith" | "The just shall live by his obedience" ✓ |
| Rom 1:5 | "obedience to the faith" | "obedience to the [standard of] obedience" ✓ |
| James 2:17 | "faith without works is dead" | "obedience without works is dead" — (obedience IS works) ✓ |
| Matt 9:22 | "Thy faith hath made thee whole" | "Thy trusting obedience hath made thee whole" ✓ |
| Heb 11:1 | "faith is the substance of things hoped for" | "trusting obedience is the assurance of things hoped for" ✓ |
| Eph 2:8 | "by grace are ye saved through faith" | "by grace are ye saved through trusting obedience" ✓ |

## Antithetical Analysis

**FAITH (Obedience)** vs. **UNBELIEF (Disobedience)**

> **Hebrews 3:18-19** — "And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that **believed not**? So we see that they could not enter in because of **unbelief**."

> **Hebrews 4:6** — "they entered not in because of **unbelief**"

The Israelites' unbelief was manifested as disobedience — they didn't act on God's word. Unbelief and disobedience are equated.

---

## Conclusion

**FAITH** symbolically represents **OBEDIENCE** — trusting obedience that acts on what God has said. It is not mere mental belief but active, steadfast response to God's word (TRUTH).

This connects the symbolic web:
- **TRUTH** = God's Standard (what He commands)
- **FAITH** = Obedience (our response to that standard)
- **LIGHT** = Visible Example (the demonstration of that obedience)
