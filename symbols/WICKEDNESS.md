## Step 0: Early Focus Checklist

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **What TYPE?** | Character/Moral State |
| 2 | **Explicit definition?** | YES — Deut 17:2 (transgressing covenant); Greek anomia (lawlessness) |
| 3 | **What is the OPPOSITE?** | Righteousness |
| 4 | **What VERBS accompany it?** | BURNS, DEVOURS, KINDLES |
| 5 | **Defined in terms of other symbols?** | Connected to TRUTH (opposite) |
| 6 | **Literal synonym?** | "Evil" would be too literal; "Lawlessness" captures the specific biblical definition |

## Evidence: WHAT Wickedness IS

### Deuteronomy 17:2 — Explicit Definition
> "If there be found among you... man or woman, that hath wrought **wickedness** in the sight of the LORD thy God, in **transgressing his covenant**"

**WICKEDNESS = TRANSGRESSING GOD'S COVENANT**

### 2 Thessalonians 2:7-8 — Greek Definition
> "the mystery of **iniquity** [ἀνομία anomia] doth already work... then shall that **Wicked** [ἄνομος anomos] be revealed"

- ἀνομία (anomia) = **lawlessness** (a = without, nomos = law)
- ἄνομος (anomos) = **lawless one**

**WICKEDNESS = LAWLESSNESS** — the Greek gives the precise definition.

### Isaiah 57:20-21 — Nature of the Wicked
> "the **wicked** are like the **troubled sea**, when it cannot rest... There is no peace, saith my God, to the **wicked**"

The wicked are like the SEA (chaotic peoples) — restless, turbulent, without peace.

## Evidence: WHAT Wickedness DOES

### Isaiah 9:18 — Burns and Devours
> "For **wickedness** burneth as the **fire**: it shall **devour** the briers and thorns, and shall **kindle** in the thickets of the forest"

**Key Verbs**:
- BURNS (like fire)
- DEVOURS (consumes)
- KINDLES (spreads destruction)

**WICKEDNESS ACTS LIKE FIRE** — it burns, devours, and spreads.

### Isaiah 9:19-20 — Self-Consuming
> "the people shall be as the **fuel** of the fire: no man shall spare his brother... they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm"

Wickedness ultimately **CONSUMES ITSELF** — the people become fuel for the fire they started.

## Two-Dimensional Summary

| Dimension | Meaning | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **WHAT IT IS** | Lawlessness / Covenant Transgression | Deut 17:2, Greek anomia |
| **WHAT IT DOES** | Burns / Devours / Self-destructs | Isaiah 9:18-20 |

## Connection to Symbol Pairings

### WICKEDNESS + THORNS (Isaiah 9:18)
When paired:
- **WICKEDNESS** = the FIRE (cause/agent)
- **THORNS** = the fuel that gets DEVOURED (result/object)

The pairing reveals: Lawlessness produces cursed fruit (thorns), then consumes even its own fruit in its burning. Self-destructive cycle.

### WICKEDNESS + SEA (Isaiah 57:20)
When paired:
- **WICKED** = like the SEA
- **SEA** = chaotic, restless peoples

The pairing reveals: The wicked person is in the same state as unsanctified humanity — turbulent, restless, no peace.

## Relationship to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | WICKEDNESS = Rejecting/transgressing that standard |
| **THORNS** | Cursed Fruit | WICKEDNESS produces thorns, then devours them |
| **SEA** | Chaotic Peoples | Wicked are LIKE the sea — restless, turbulent |
| **RIGHTEOUSNESS** | Covenant Keeping | OPPOSITE of wickedness |

## Dual Application Test

| Subject | Application | Works? |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Humans** | Can humans be lawless? | ✓ Yes — rejecting God's standard |
| **Satan** | Is Satan lawless? | ✓ Yes — the "lawless one" (2 Thess 2:8) |
| **Systems** | Can systems be wicked? | ✓ Yes — Babylon, false religion |

## Conclusion

WICKEDNESS has **two dimensions**:

1. **WHAT IT IS**: Lawlessness — transgressing God's covenant/standard (explicitly defined in Deut 17:2 and Greek anomia)

2. **WHAT IT DOES**: Burns and devours — acts like fire, spreading destruction and ultimately consuming even itself

This two-dimensional meaning explains why Scripture says "there is no peace to the wicked" — lawlessness is inherently self-destructive.
