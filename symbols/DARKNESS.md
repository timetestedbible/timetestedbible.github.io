# DARKNESS — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Hidden |
| **Two Words** | Concealed Disobedience |
| **Sentence** | The state of concealing one's conduct from scrutiny—living in such a way that deeds are hidden, particularly lawless deeds that cannot bear the exposure of light (visible example) |

**Opposite**: Light = Visible Example / Visible Obedience to Commandments

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly contrasts darkness with light and defines the relationship:

- **1 John 1:5** — "God **is** light, and in him is **no darkness at all**"
- **2 Corinthians 6:14** — "what communion hath **light** with **darkness**?" (paralleled with righteousness vs. unrighteousness)
- **John 3:19** — "men loved **darkness** rather than **light**, because their **deeds were evil**"
- **Proverbs 4:19** — "The way of the **wicked** [is] as **darkness**: they know not at what they stumble"

The explicit connection: **darkness is associated with wickedness, evil deeds, and unrighteousness**.

### 2. The Hiding/Concealment Evidence

The defining characteristic of darkness throughout Scripture is that it **hides things from sight**:

- **John 3:20** — "For every one that doeth evil **hateth the light**, neither **cometh to the light**, **lest his deeds should be reproved**"
- **Ephesians 5:11-12** — "have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness... for it is a **shame** even to speak of those things which are **done of them in secret**"
- **Job 34:22** — "There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the **workers of iniquity may hide themselves**"
- **1 Corinthians 4:5** — "the Lord... will bring to light the **hidden things of darkness**"
- **Daniel 2:22** — "He revealeth the deep and **secret things**: he knoweth what [is] **in the darkness**"

The pattern is unmistakable: **darkness = the realm of concealment where wicked deeds are hidden**.

### 3. The Functional Evidence

What does darkness DO in Scripture?

| Function | Verse |
|----------|-------|
| **Blinds/Prevents understanding** | 1 John 2:11, Psalm 82:5 |
| **Causes confusion** | John 12:35, Proverbs 4:19 |
| **Conceals/Hides** | Job 34:22, Dan 2:22, 1 Cor 4:5 |
| **Produces shame** | Ephesians 5:12 |
| **Associates with Satan's power** | Acts 26:18, Luke 22:53, Col 1:13 |

The relational function: darkness conceals, and those in darkness "know not whither they go" (John 12:35) because they have hidden from the light that would guide them.

### 4. The Antithetical Evidence

Since LIGHT = Visible Obedience to Commandments, DARKNESS should be its opposite:

| LIGHT | DARKNESS |
|-------|----------|
| Visible | Hidden |
| Obedience | Disobedience |
| Righteousness (2 Cor 6:14) | Unrighteousness |
| Truth (1 John 1:6) | Lie |
| Exposed deeds (John 3:21) | Concealed deeds (John 3:20) |
| Good works seen (Matt 5:16) | Shameful works done in secret (Eph 5:12) |

**Darkness = Hidden/Concealed Disobedience** — the exact opposite of visible obedience.

### 5. The Behavioral Evidence

How are we commanded to relate to darkness?

- **Do NOT walk in it**: 1 John 1:6, John 8:12, John 12:35
- **Cast off its works**: Romans 13:12
- **Have no fellowship with its works**: Ephesians 5:11
- **Turn FROM it TO light**: Acts 26:18

The behavioral commands treat darkness as a state to be abandoned—to stop hiding and come into the open.

### 6. Why "CONCEALED DISOBEDIENCE" and Not Other Meanings?

**Considered alternatives:**

| Meaning | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Absence of light" | Dictionary definition—physical, not symbolic |
| "Ignorance" | Ignorance is a RESULT of darkness, not its meaning (those in darkness "know not") |
| "Evil" | Too vague—doesn't capture the specific HIDING aspect |
| "Sin" | Partial—but darkness specifically involves CONCEALMENT of sin |

**"Concealed Disobedience" unifies all functions:**
- It mirrors LIGHT (visible obedience) perfectly
- It explains why evil-doers LOVE darkness (they want to hide)
- It explains why darkness causes blindness (hiding from light removes guidance)
- It explains "works of darkness" (works done in secret)
- It explains "power of darkness" (Satan's realm operates through concealment)

### 7. The Human Application Test

"Can humans BE in darkness?" — **YES**

- Ephesians 5:8: "ye **were** sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord"
- 1 John 2:9: "He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, **is in darkness** even until now"
- 1 John 2:11: "he that hateth his brother **is in darkness**, and **walketh in darkness**"

This confirms the meaning must apply to human conduct, not just cosmic forces.

### 8. The "Secret" Connection — Closing the Loop

The explicit connection between darkness and secrecy appears in:

- **Ephesians 5:12** — "it is a **shame** even to speak of those things which are **done of them in secret**"
- **2 Kings 17:9** — "the children of Israel did **secretly** [those] things that **were not right** against the LORD their God"
- **2 Samuel 12:12** — God to David: "thou didst [it] **secretly**: but I will do this thing **before all Israel**, and **before the sun**"

The pattern: darkness = doing things secretly that should be done openly. David's sin was done in darkness (secretly); God's response brings it to light (publicly).

## Key Proof Texts

1. **John 3:19-21** — "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, **because their deeds were evil**. For every one that doeth evil **hateth the light**, neither cometh to the light, **lest his deeds should be reproved**. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest."

   This is the clearest text: darkness = the realm evil-doers LOVE because it HIDES their deeds from reproof.

2. **Ephesians 5:11-13** — "have no fellowship with the unfruitful **works of darkness**, but rather reprove them. For it is a **shame** even to speak of those things which are **done of them in secret**. But all things that are reproved are **made manifest by the light**: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."

   Works of darkness = works done in secret that produce shame when exposed.

3. **1 John 1:5-7** — "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with him, and **walk in darkness**, we **lie**, and **do not the truth**: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another."

   Walking in darkness while claiming fellowship = lying. The deception implies hiding one's true conduct.

4. **Job 34:22** — "There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the **workers of iniquity may hide themselves**."

   Explicit: darkness = the place workers of iniquity TRY to hide. But God sees all.

5. **Proverbs 4:18-19** — "the path of the just [is] as the shining light... The way of the **wicked** [is] as **darkness**: they **know not** at what they stumble."

   The wicked walk in darkness (hidden disobedience) and consequently don't know where they're going—darkness produces blindness.

## Conclusion

DARKNESS symbolizes **concealed disobedience**—the state of hiding one's conduct, particularly lawless conduct, from scrutiny. It is the exact opposite of LIGHT (visible obedience to commandments).

This meaning works for:
- **The wicked**: Who love darkness because it hides their evil deeds (John 3:19)
- **Believers (former state)**: Who "were sometimes darkness" before coming to the light (Eph 5:8)
- **Self-deceived believers**: Who claim to be in light but walk in darkness—living a hidden double life (1 John 1:6, 2:9)
- **Satan's realm**: Which operates through hidden, deceptive means (Luke 22:53, Col 1:13)

**The core insight**: Darkness is not primarily about ignorance or evil in the abstract—it is about **HIDING**. Those who do evil love darkness because it conceals their deeds from reproof. Those who do truth come to the light so their deeds may be made manifest. The call to "walk in the light" is a call to **live openly**, with no hidden wickedness.
