## The Argument

### 1. Sleep = Death (Literal Metaphor)

Throughout Scripture, "sleep" is used as a euphemism for death:

| Verse | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| Kings/Chronicles | "slept with his fathers" = died (dozens of occurrences) |
| Matt 9:24, Mark 5:39, Luke 8:52 | Jesus: "the maid is not dead, but **sleepeth**" |
| John 11:11-13 | "Lazarus **sleepeth**... Jesus spake of his **death**" |
| 1 Cor 15:6,18 | "some are **fallen asleep**" / "**asleep** in Christ" |
| 1 Thess 4:13-15 | "them which are **asleep**" = the dead in Christ |
| Daniel 12:2 | "many that **sleep** in the dust of the earth shall awake" |
| Psalm 13:3 | "lest I **sleep** the sleep of **death**" |

The connection is clear: Sleep is a temporary state of unconsciousness; death is presented as a "sleep" from which one will awaken (resurrection).

### 2. Spiritual Sleep = Spiritual Death/Unawareness

Scripture also uses "sleep" for spiritual unconsciousness:

#### Romans 13:11
> "And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to **awake out of sleep**: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."

#### Ephesians 5:14
> "Wherefore he saith, **Awake thou that sleepest**, and **arise from the dead**, and Christ shall give thee light."

This verse explicitly equates:
- **Sleepest** = **Dead**
- **Awake** = **Arise from the dead**

And connects it to LIGHT (awareness, visible example).

#### 1 Thessalonians 5:6-7
> "Therefore let us **not sleep**, as do others; but let us **watch** and be **sober**. For they that **sleep** sleep in the **night**."

The contrasts:
| Sleep | Awake |
|-------|-------|
| Unaware | Watching |
| Drunk | Sober |
| Night | Day |

### 3. The Contrast: Sleep vs. Watch

The opposite of spiritual sleep is to "WATCH":

| Greek | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **καθεύδω** (katheudō) | to sleep |
| **γρηγορέω** (grēgoreō) | to watch, be vigilant, be awake |

To "watch" means:
- Be alert to spiritual reality
- Be aware of the times
- Be vigilant against deception
- Be ready for Christ's return

Sleep = the opposite of all these = spiritual unawareness/negligence.

### 4. Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Connection |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **LIGHT** | Visible Example | Awareness, seeing |
| **DARKNESS** | Hidden/Concealed | Unawareness, blindness |
| **SLEEP** | Death/Unaware | Unconscious to reality |
| **AWAKE** | Alert/Watching | Conscious, responsive |

Ephesians 5:14 ties them together:
> "**Awake** thou that **sleepest**, and **arise from the dead**, and Christ shall give thee **LIGHT**"

Sleep (death/unawareness) → Awake (arise) → Receive LIGHT (become aware, be an example)

### 5. Physical and Spiritual Parallel

| Physical | Spiritual |
|----------|-----------|
| Sleep | Unconscious of surroundings |
| Death | Completely unresponsive |
| Awake | Alert, aware, active |

| Spiritual | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Sleep/Death | Unconscious of God's truth, spiritually inactive |
| Awake/Watch | Alert to God's truth, spiritually active |

## Substitution Stress Test

| Verse | With "Death / Spiritually Unaware" |
|-------|-----------------------------------|
| Rom 13:11 "awake out of sleep" | "awake out of spiritual unawareness" ✓ |
| Eph 5:14 "Awake thou that sleepest, arise from the dead" | Explicit equation: sleep = dead ✓ |
| 1 Thess 5:6 "let us not sleep... but watch" | "let us not be unaware... but vigilant" ✓ |
| 1 Thess 4:14 "them which sleep in Jesus" | "them which are dead in Jesus" ✓ |
| Matt 9:24 "the maid is not dead, but sleepeth" | Sleep used for physical death ✓ |

## Summary

**SLEEP** symbolically means **DEATH / Spiritual Unawareness** — a state of unconsciousness to spiritual reality.

The evidence:
1. Scripture consistently uses "sleep" as a euphemism for physical death
2. Scripture commands believers to "awake out of sleep" spiritually
3. Ephesians 5:14 explicitly equates "sleepest" with "dead"
4. The opposite of sleep is to "watch" — be alert, vigilant, aware

The spiritually asleep person is:
- Unaware of the times
- Unresponsive to God's truth
- Not watching for Christ's return
- Living in spiritual darkness

The call is to AWAKE — become alert, arise from death, receive LIGHT.
