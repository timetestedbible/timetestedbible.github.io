# SHEEP — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Followers |
| **Two Words** | Covenant People |
| **Sentence** | God's people who hear, follow, and are led within the covenant — characterized by dependence on the shepherd, obedient hearing, and vulnerability without proper leadership |

**Opposite**: GOAT = Self-willed / Independent / Disobedient (Matt 25:32-33)

## Key Strong's Numbers

| Word | Strong's | Definition | KJV Translations |
|------|----------|------------|------------------|
| צֹאן (*tso'n*) | H6629 | "a collective name for a flock (of sheep or goats); **also figuratively (of men)**" — from a root meaning to migrate | cattle, flock, lamb, sheep |
| צֹנֵא (*tsone'*) | H6792 | "a flock" — alternate form of H6629 | sheep |
| πρόβατον (*probaton*) | G4263 | "something that walks forward (a quadruped), i.e. (specially) a sheep (literally or figuratively)" | sheep, sheepfold |

**Observations**: The Hebrew H6629 itself marks the figurative use for men. The root meaning "to migrate" captures the sheep's essential nature — a creature that moves in groups, following a leader. The Greek G4263 literally means "something that walks forward" — forward motion under direction.

## The Argument

### 1. The Explicit Definition — Sheep = Men/God's People

Scripture explicitly defines sheep as people:

- **Ezekiel 34:31** — "ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, **are men**, and I am your God" — THE explicit definition
- **Psalm 100:3** — "we are his people, and the **sheep of his pasture**"
- **Psalm 95:7** — "we are the people of his pasture, and the **sheep of his hand**"
- **Psalm 79:13** — "we **thy people** and **sheep of thy pasture** will give thee thanks for ever"
- **Psalm 74:1** — "why doth thine anger smoke against the **sheep of thy pasture**?"
- **John 10:27** — "**My sheep** hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me"
- **Matthew 10:6** — "the **lost sheep** of the house of Israel"
- **Isaiah 53:6** — "All **we** like **sheep** have gone astray"

This aligns with the existing ANIMAL study (ANIMAL = People-group). SHEEP is the specific subset: God's covenant people.

### 2. The Functional Evidence — What Sheep DO

| Behavior | Key Verse |
|----------|-----------|
| **Hear** the shepherd's voice | John 10:3-4, 27 |
| **Follow** the shepherd | John 10:4, 27 |
| **Know** the shepherd's voice | John 10:4-5 |
| **Go astray** (natural tendency) | Isa 53:6, 1 Pet 2:25, Matt 18:12 |
| **Are scattered** when shepherd is smitten | Zech 13:7, Matt 26:31 |
| **Are vulnerable** without a shepherd | Ezek 34:5-8, Num 27:17 |
| **Are silent** before shearers (submissive) | Isa 53:7 |
| **Cannot lead themselves** | Num 27:17 — "as sheep which have no shepherd" |
| **Need pasture** (provision) | Ps 23:2, Ezek 34:14 |
| **Lie down** when provided for | Ps 23:2, Ezek 34:15 |

The defining characteristic: sheep **hear and follow**. They don't lead — they are led. They don't provide for themselves — they are provided for. Their well-being depends entirely on the quality of their shepherd.

### 3. The Behavioral Evidence — Commands and Descriptions

How are God's people described AS sheep?

- **Matthew 10:16** — "I send you forth as **sheep** in the midst of **wolves**: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves" — sheep among wolves = vulnerable covenant people among predatory peoples
- **Romans 8:36** — "For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as **sheep for the slaughter**" — the vulnerability/suffering aspect
- **Isaiah 53:7** — "he is brought as a **lamb** to the slaughter, and as a **sheep** before her shearers is dumb" — silent submission, applied to Christ
- **Acts 8:32** — Philip reads Isaiah 53:7 to the Ethiopian: "He was led as a **sheep** to the slaughter"
- **1 Peter 2:25** — "ye were as **sheep going astray**; but are now **returned** unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls" — sheep stray but can return

### 4. The Antithetical Evidence — Sheep vs. Goats

The most explicit contrast is **Matthew 25:31-46** — the judgment of the nations:

| SHEEP (right hand) | GOATS (left hand) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| "Come, ye blessed" (v.34) | "Depart from me, ye cursed" (v.41) |
| Inherit the kingdom (v.34) | Everlasting fire (v.41) |
| Fed the hungry, clothed the naked, visited the sick/imprisoned (v.35-36) | Did NOT do these things (v.42-43) |
| "Inasmuch as ye **have done** it unto one of the least" (v.40) | "Inasmuch as ye **did it not**" (v.45) |
| → **Obedient doers** | → **Disobedient non-doers** |

This maps directly to the existing symbol framework:
- SHEEP = those who **obey** (FAITH = Obedience)
- GOATS = those who **refuse** to act

Also: **Zechariah 10:3** — "Mine anger was kindled against the **shepherds**, and I **punished the goats**" — bad shepherds and goats are judged together; goats represent the self-willed who reject proper leadership.

### 5. The Lost Sheep — Straying and Returning

A critical dimension: sheep naturally go astray.

- **Isaiah 53:6** — "All we like sheep **have gone astray**; we have turned every one **to his own way**"
- **1 Peter 2:25** — "ye were as sheep **going astray**; but are now **returned** unto the Shepherd"
- **Jeremiah 50:6** — "My people hath been **lost sheep**: their **shepherds** have caused them to go astray"
- **Matthew 18:12-14** — The parable of the one lost sheep: "if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"
- **Luke 15:4-7** — The same parable with the conclusion: "joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth"

Two causes of straying:
1. **Own nature** — "we have turned every one to **his own way**" (Isa 53:6)
2. **Bad shepherds** — "their **shepherds** have caused them to go astray" (Jer 50:6)

The sheep's vulnerability cuts both ways: they can be led rightly or led astray. The quality of leadership determines the condition of the flock.

### 6. Within the Flock — Fat Cattle vs. Lean Cattle (Ezekiel 34:17-22)

Even among sheep, Scripture distinguishes:

- **Ezekiel 34:17** — "I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats"
- **Ezekiel 34:18-19** — The "fat cattle" eat good pasture and tread down the rest; drink deep waters and foul the rest
- **Ezekiel 34:20-21** — "I will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns"
- **Ezekiel 34:22** — "Therefore will I save my flock... I will judge between cattle and cattle"

Within the covenant community itself, some oppress others. Not all who are "in the flock" behave as true sheep.

### 7. Wolves in Sheep's Clothing (Matthew 7:15)

- "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in **sheep's clothing**, but inwardly they are **ravening wolves**"

The disguise works precisely because sheep = God's harmless, obedient people. The wolf pretends to be a covenant follower while actually being a predator.

### 8. Why "Covenant People" and Not Other Meanings?

**Candidates considered:**

| Candidate | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| "Followers" | Too generic — a secular reader arrives here; misses the covenantal framework |
| "Obedient people" | Closer, but sheep also go astray — obedience is the IDEAL, not the constant |
| "Vulnerable people" | Only captures one dimension; misses the hearing/following aspect |
| "God's people" | Too vague — what DEFINES them as God's people? |
| "Covenant People" | Captures the full picture: defined by covenant relationship to the shepherd, characterized by hearing/following, vulnerable without leadership, capable of straying |

The sheep are specifically those in **covenant relationship** with the shepherd — they belong to him ("my sheep"), hear his voice, follow him, and he knows them by name. This is covenant language throughout.

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Ezekiel 34:31** — "ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, **are men**, and I am your God." The explicit definition. Sheep = men who belong to God.

2. **John 10:27-28** — "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life." The definitive description of the sheep-shepherd relationship: hearing, knowing, following, and receiving.

3. **Isaiah 53:6** — "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way." The universal condition: covenant people naturally wander from the path.

4. **Matthew 25:32-33** — "he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats." The eschatological distinction: sheep (obedient doers) vs. goats (disobedient non-doers).

5. **Psalm 100:3** — "we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture." The identification: God's people = sheep of His pasture.

This is why:
- We ARE sheep of His pasture (we are God's covenant people — Ps 100:3)
- Sheep HEAR the shepherd's voice (covenant people recognize covenant truth — John 10:27)
- Sheep FOLLOW (covenant people obey — John 10:4)
- Sheep GO ASTRAY (covenant people wander from the path — Isa 53:6)
- Sheep are VULNERABLE without a shepherd (covenant people need covenant leadership — Num 27:17)
- Sheep are separated from GOATS at judgment (the obedient from the self-willed — Matt 25:32)
- Christ sends us as SHEEP among WOLVES (covenant people are harmless among predators — Matt 10:16)
- "FEED MY SHEEP" (care for my covenant people — John 21:16)
