- **FAITH** = Trusting obedience to the covenant — believing "on the NAME" = trusting the covenant
- **FORNICATION** = Breaking covenant — profaning "the NAME" = dishonoring the covenant

### WINGS

| Dimension | Symbolic Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **IS (One Word)** | Covenant |
| **IS (Two Words)** | Covenant Covering |
| **DOES (One Word)** | Covers |
| **DOES (Two Words)** | Protects |
| **Sentence** | The protective covering of covenant relationship — to come "under wings" is to enter covenant; to "spread wings/skirt over" someone is to take them into covenant |

**Opposite**: Exposed / Uncovered / Outside covenant

**Key Proof Texts**:
- **Ezekiel 16:8** — "I **spread my skirt** (H3671) **over thee**... and **entered into a COVENANT** with thee" — EXPLICIT DEFINITION
- **Ruth 2:12** — "under whose **wings** (H3671) thou art come to trust" — Coming under God's covenant
- **Ruth 3:9** — "spread therefore thy **skirt** (H3671) over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman" — Marriage covenant request (SAME WORD as "wings")
- **Psalm 91:4** — "under his **wings** shalt thou trust" — Covenant protection
- **Malachi 4:2** — "unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with **healing in his wings**" — Messiah's covenant brings healing
- **Matthew 23:37** — "how often would I have gathered thy children... as a hen gathereth her chickens **under her wings**" — Covenant offer rejected

**Strong's**:
- H3671 (כָּנָף / kanaph): "an edge or extremity; (of a bird) a **wing**, (of a garment) a **flap/skirt**, (of the earth) a quarter"
- G4420 (πτέρυξ / pteryx): "a wing"

**Critical Insight — Translation Variation**:
The Hebrew H3671 is translated as BOTH "wings" AND "skirt" — the same word! This reveals that spreading a garment's edge over someone and a bird covering with wings are THE SAME CONCEPT: covenant covering/protection. English translations obscure this connection.

**Relationship to Other Symbols**:
- **NAME** = Covenant (relationship) — WINGS = Covenant (covering/protection)
- **Cherubim wings** cover the ARK of the COVENANT — wings protect the covenant
- **Tzitzit** are on the WINGS/corners (H3671) of the garment (Numbers 15:38) — covenant reminders on the "wings"

### EAGLE

| Dimension | Symbolic Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **IS (One Word)** | Messenger |
| **IS (Two Words)** | Angel / Agent |
| **DOES (One Word)** | Bears |
| **DOES (Two Words)** | Carries |
| **Sentence** | A messenger or agent sent under covenant authority — angels have wings, cherubim have eagle faces, and empires act as God's messengers of judgment |

**Opposite**: Unsent / Unauthorized

**Key Proof Texts**:
- **Ezekiel 1:10 / 10:14 / Revelation 4:7** — Cherubim have the face of an **EAGLE** — angels = eagle-faced
- **Exodus 19:4 + 23:20-21** — "I bare you on **eagles' wings**" + "I send an **angel** before you" — same context, eagle = messenger
- **Ezekiel 17:3,7,12,15** — Two **eagles** = Babylon and Egypt — empires acting as God's agents/messengers
- **Deuteronomy 32:11** — Eagle stirs nest, bears young on wings — messenger carries/delivers
- **Revelation 12:14** — Woman given "two wings of a great **eagle**" — messenger-like deliverance

**Strong's**:
- H5404 (נֶשֶׁר / nesher): "the eagle (or other large bird of prey)"
- H5403 (נְשַׁר / neshar): Aramaic, corresponding to H5404
- G105 (ἀετός / aetos): "an eagle (from its wind-like flight)"

**Critical Insight — Cherubim Connection**:
The cherubim (angels) have FOUR FACES: man, lion, ox, and **EAGLE**. The eagle face represents one aspect of angelic/messenger nature. Angels have WINGS (covenant authority), and the eagle symbolizes the messenger who operates under those wings.

**Relationship to Other Symbols**:
- **WINGS** = Covenant Covering (the authority under which the messenger operates)
- **EAGLE** = Messenger (the entity that possesses and uses those wings)
- An eagle HAS wings → A messenger operates UNDER covenant authority

### MARRIAGE

| Dimension | Symbolic Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **IS (One Word)** | Covenant |
| **IS (Two Words)** | Covenant Picture |
| **DOES (One Word)** | Binds |
| **DOES (Two Words)** | Pictures |
| **Sentence** | The covenant relationship between God and His people pictured in human marriage — husband represents God/Christ, wife represents Israel/Church, faithfulness represents covenant obedience |

**Opposite**: Divorce / Covenant Breaking

**Key Proof Texts**:
- **Isaiah 54:5** — "thy Maker is thine **husband**"
- **Jeremiah 3:14** — "I am **married** unto you"
- **Hosea 2:19** — "I will **betroth** thee unto me for ever"
- **2 Corinthians 11:2** — "espoused you to one **husband**... Christ"
- **Revelation 19:7** — "the **marriage** of the Lamb is come"

**Strong's**:
- H802 (אִשָּׁה / ishshah): "woman, wife"
- H376 (אִישׁ / ish): "man, husband"
- G1062 (γάμος / gamos): "marriage, wedding"
- G3565 (νύμφη / nymphe): "bride"
- G3566 (νυμφίος / nymphios): "bridegroom"

**Critical Insight — The Redundancy Test**:
Jesus permits divorce "except for fornication" (Matthew 5:32, 19:9). This CANNOT mean sexual sin because adultery already has its own penalty: **death** (Leviticus 20:10). You don't need divorce provisions for a capital crime. Therefore "fornication" = **idolatry**.

**Grounds for Divorce**:
| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Sexual adultery | Death penalty (Torah) |
| Fornication (idolatry) | Divorce **permitted** |
| Unequally yoked | Divorce **commanded** (Ezra 10:3) |

**Relationship to Other Symbols**:
- **FORNICATION** = Idolatry (breaking the marriage with God)
- **VIRGIN** = Covenant Faithful (faithful wife)
- **HARLOT** = Covenant Unfaithful (unfaithful wife)
- **WINGS** = Covenant Covering (spread over bride to marry — Ruth 3:9, Ezekiel 16:8)

### MARK

| Dimension | Symbolic Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|
| **IS (One Word)** | Observance |
| **IS (Two Words)** | Visible Practice |
| **DOES (One Word)** | Identifies |
| **DOES (Two Words)** | Shows Allegiance |
| **Sentence** | The practice or observance that identifies which authority's covenant you follow—what you DO (hand) and THINK (forehead) that marks you as belonging to a particular master |

**Opposite**: Unmarked / Unidentified / No visible allegiance

**Key Proof Texts**:
- **Exodus 31:13** — "my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a **sign**{H226} between me and you"
- **Deuteronomy 6:8** — "bind **them** [the commandments] for a **sign**{H226} upon thine hand"
- **Exodus 13:9** — "it shall be for a **sign** unto thee upon thine **hand**... that **the LORD's law** may be in thy mouth"
- **Revelation 14:12** — Those with God's seal "keep the **commandments** of God"
- **Revelation 13:16** — "receive a mark in their right **hand**, or in their **foreheads**"

**Critical Discovery — H226 = Mark = Sign = Token**:
The KJV translates the SAME Hebrew word (H226 - אוֹת) as "mark" (Gen 4:15), "sign" (Exo 31:13), and "token" (Gen 9:12, 17:11). Understanding any of these illuminates all of them.

**What IS the Sign/Mark/Token?**:
- Rainbow (Gen 9:12)
- Circumcision (Gen 17:11)
- Passover blood (Exo 12:13)
- **Sabbath** (Exo 31:13)
- **Commandments** on hand/forehead (Deut 6:8)

These are all **OBSERVANCES** — practices that identify covenant membership.

**How You TAKE the Mark**:
| God's Mark | Beast's Mark |
|------------|--------------|
| KEEP the Sabbath | FOLLOW the beast's system |
| OBSERVE God's commandments | PRACTICE the beast's ordinances |
| DO what God commands (hand) | DO what the beast commands (hand) |
| THINK according to God's word (forehead) | THINK according to beast's ideology (forehead) |

**Location — Hand and Forehead**:
- **Hand** = What you DO (actions, works)
- **Forehead** = What you THINK/BELIEVE (mind, allegiance)

The mark in hand/forehead means your PRACTICES and BELIEFS align with that authority.

**Relationship to Other Symbols**:
- **NAME** = Covenant (the relationship itself)
- **MARK** = Observance (the visible practice that identifies covenant membership)
- **TRUTH** = God's Standard (the content of what is observed)
- **FAITH** = Obedience (the response to the standard)

## Symbol Pairings

### TREE + ANIMAL (Daniel 4:12,21)

| Symbol | IS | Position |
|--------|-----|----------|
| TREE | Empire | Dominant — provides shadow |
| ANIMAL | Tribe/Sub-state | Subordinate — dwells UNDER |

**The Pairing Reveals**: When two symbols seem to have similar meanings (both representing "peoples"), find passages where they appear TOGETHER. Their SPATIAL relationship (animals UNDER the tree) reveals their HIERARCHICAL relationship. The tree (empire) shelters the animals (subordinate tribes/peoples).

**Principle**: Resolve Symbolic Overlap via Positional Relationships — "under" = subordinate, "over" = dominant, "in" = contained within.

---

### WICKEDNESS + THORNS (Isaiah 9:18)

| Symbol | IS | DOES |
|--------|-----|------|
| WICKEDNESS | Lawlessness | Burns/Consumes |
| THORNS | Cursed Fruit | Chokes/Afflicts |

**The Pairing Reveals**: Wickedness (lawlessness) is the FIRE/CAUSE that produces thorns (cursed fruit), and then CONSUMES its own fruit. The self-destructive cycle of rebellion — lawlessness produces obstacles that choke fruitfulness, then lawlessness devours even those obstacles in its burning.

**Principle**: When symbols appear TOGETHER, ask: What is the CAUSE-EFFECT or AGENT-RESULT relationship?
