</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Remember us, O Lord, with the favor <span class='add'>thou hast</span> to thy people:  </div><div class='q'>Visit us with thy salvation;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>That we may behold the good of thine elect,  </div><div class='q'>That we may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation,  </div><div class='q'>That we may glory with thine inheritance.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>We have sinned with our fathers,  </div><div class='q'>We have transgressed, we have done unrighteously.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders,  </div><div class='q'>And remembered not the multitude of thy mercy;  </div><div class='q'>But provoked <span class='add'>him</span> as they went up by the Red Sea.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Yet he saved them for his name’s sake,  </div><div class='q'>That he might cause his mighty power to be known.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up:  </div><div class='q'>So he led them through the deep as through the wilderness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated <span class='add'>them</span>,  </div><div class='q'>And redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The water covered those that oppressed them:  </div><div class='q'>There was not one of them left.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then they believed his words,  </div><div class='q'>And celebrated his praise.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>They made haste, they forgot his works;  </div><div class='q'>They waited not for his counsel.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,  </div><div class='q'>And tempted God in the dry <span class='add'>land</span>.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he gave them their request,  </div><div class='q'>And sent fullness into their souls.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They provoked Moses also in the camp,  </div><div class='q'>And Aaron the holy one of the Lord.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,  </div><div class='q'>And closed upon the congregation of Abiram.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And a fire was kindled in their congregation,  </div><div class='q'>And a flame burned up the sinners.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they made a calf in Horeb,  </div><div class='q'>And worshiped the graven image,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they changed their glory  </div><div class='q'>Into the similitude of a calf that feeds on grass.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>They forgot God that saved them,  </div><div class='q'>Who had wrought great deeds in Egypt;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wondrous <span class='add'>works</span> in the land of Ham,  </div><div class='q'>And terrible things at the Red Sea.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So he said that he would have destroyed them,  </div><div class='q'>Had not Moses his chosen  </div><div class='q'>Stood before him in the breach,  </div><div class='q'>To turn <span class='add'>him</span> away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Moreover they set at nought the desirable land,  </div><div class='q'>And believed not his word.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they murmured in their tents:  </div><div class='q'>They hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>So he lifted up his hand against them,  </div><div class='q'>To cast them down in the wilderness;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And to cast down their seed among the nations,  </div><div class='q'>And to scatter them in the countries.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>They were joined also to Baal-peor,  </div><div class='q'>And ate the sacrifices of the dead.  </div><div class='q'>And they provoked him with their devices;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And destruction was multiplied among them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then Phinehas stood up, and made atonement:  </div><div class='q'>And the plague ceased.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it was counted to him for righteousness,  </div><div class='q'>To all generations forever.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>They provoked him also at the water of Strife,  </div><div class='q'>And Moses was hurt for their sakes;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For they provoked his spirit,  </div><div class='q'>And he spoke <span class='add'>unadvisedly</span> with his lips.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them <span class='add'>to destroy</span>;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>But were mingled with the heathen,  </div><div class='q'>And learned their works.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And they served their graven images;  </div><div class='q'>And it became an offense to them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And they sacrificed their sons  </div><div class='q'>And their daughters to devils,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And shed innocent blood,  </div><div class='q'>The blood of their sons and daughters,  </div><div class='q'>Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;  </div><div class='q'>And the land was defiled with blood,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And was polluted with their works;  </div><div class='q'>And they went a-whoring with their own devices.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>So the Lord was very angry with his people,  </div><div class='q'>And he abhorred his inheritance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And he delivered them into the hands of <span class='add'>their</span> enemies;  </div><div class='q'>And they that hated them ruled over them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And their enemies oppressed them,  </div><div class='q'>And they were brought down under their hands.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Many a time he delivered them;  </div><div class='q'>But they provoked him by their counsel,  </div><div class='q'>And they were brought low by their iniquities.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Yet the Lord looked upon their affliction,  </div><div class='q'>When he heard their petition.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And he remembered his covenant,  </div><div class='q'>And repented according to the multitude of his mercy.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And he caused them to be pitied  </div><div class='q'>In the sight of all who carried them captive.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Save us, O Lord our God,  </div><div class='q'>And gather us from among the heathen,  </div><div class='q'>That we may give thanks to thy holy name,  </div><div class='q'>That we may glory in thy praise.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting;
