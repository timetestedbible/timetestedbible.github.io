And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this <span class='add'>is</span> the woman, and this <span class='add'>is</span> her son, whom Elisha restored to life.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the king asked the woman, and she told him: and the king appointed her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field from the day that she left the land until now.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Elisha came to Damascus; and the king of Syria the son of Hadad was ill, and they brought him word, saying, The man of God is come hither.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king said to Hazael, Take in thy hand a present, and go to meet the man of God, and inquire of the Lord by him, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Hazael went to meet him, and he took a present in his hand, and all the good things of Damascus, forty camels’ load, and came and stood before him, and said to Elisha, Thy son the son of Hadad, the king of Syria, has sent me to thee to inquire, saying, Shall I recover of this my disease?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elisha said, Go, say, Thou shalt certainly live; yet the Lord has shown me that thou shalt surely die.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he stood before him, and fixed <span class='add'>his countenance</span> till he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Hazael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know all the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: thou wilt utterly destroy their strongholds with fire, and thou wilt slay their choice men with the sword, and thou wilt dash their infants <span class='add'>against the ground</span>, and their women with child thou wilt rip up.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Hazael said, Who is thy servant? a dead dog, that he should do this thing? And Elisha said, The Lord has shown me thee ruling over Syria.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he departed from Elisha, and went in to his lord; and he said to him, What said Elisha to thee? and he said, He said to me, Thou shalt surely live.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and put it on his face, and he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, and while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab; for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But the Lord would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as he said he would give a light to him and to his sons continually.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they made a king over themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Joram went up to Zair, and all the chariots that were with him: and it came to pass after he had arisen, that he smote Edom who compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled to their tents.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah till this day. Then Libnah revolted at that time.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, behold, are not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>So Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>In the twelfth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram began to reign.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Twenty and two years old <span class='add'>was</span> Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and the name of his mother <span class='add'>was</span> Athaliah, daughter of Omri king of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, as did the house of Ahab.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to war against Hazael king of the Syrians in Ramoth-gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And King Joram returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds with which they wounded him in Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah son of Jehoram went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
