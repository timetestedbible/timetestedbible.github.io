for <span class='add'>I speak</span> not to your children, who know not and have not seen the discipline of the Lord thy God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand, and his high arm,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and his miracles, and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharaoh king of Egypt, and all his land;   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until ye came into this place;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and all things that he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you today.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command thee today, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>that ye may live long upon the land, which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>but the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>A land which the Lord thy God surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now if ye will indeed hearken to all the commands which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>then he shall give to thy land the early and latter rain in its season, and thou shalt bring in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he shall give food in thy fields to thy cattle; and when thou hast eaten and art full,   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>take heed to thyself that thy heart be not puffed up, and ye transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And ye shall store these words in your heart and in your soul, and ye shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall teach them to your children, so as to speak about them when thou sittest in the house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou sleepest, and when thou risest up.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses, and on your gates;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>that your days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord swore to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that if ye will indeed hearken to all these commands, which I charge thee to observe this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave close to him;   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>then the Lord shall cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall inherit great nations and stronger than yourselves.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours; from the wilderness and Antilebanon, and from the great river, the river Euphrates, even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the land, on which ye shall tread, as he told you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse;
