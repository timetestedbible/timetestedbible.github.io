And he said, That which the Lord thy God presented before me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Isaac said to Jacob, Draw nigh to me, and I will feel thee, son, if thou art my son Esau or not.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Jacob drew nigh to his father Isaac, and he felt him, and said, The voice <span class='add'>is</span> Jacob’s voice, but the hands <span class='add'>are</span> the hands of Esau.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of his brother Esau, hairy; and he blessed him,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and he said, Art thou my son Esau? and he said, I <span class='add'>am</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he said, Bring hither, and I will eat of thy venison, son, that my soul may bless thee; and he brought <span class='add'>it</span> near to him, and he ate, and he brought him wine, and he drank.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Isaac his father said to him, Draw nigh to me, and kiss me, son.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he drew nigh and kissed him, and smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said,  </div><div class='q'>Behold, the smell of my son  </div><div class='q'>Is as the smell of an abundant field, which the Lord has blessed.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And may God give thee of the dew of heaven,  </div><div class='q'>And of the fatness of the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And abundance of corn and wine.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And let nations serve thee,  </div><div class='q'>And princes bow down to thee,  </div><div class='q'>And be thou lord of thy brother,  </div><div class='q'>And the sons of thy father shall do thee reverence;  </div><div class='q'>Accursed is he that curses thee,  </div><div class='q'>And blessed is he that blesses thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass after Isaac had ceased blessing his son Jacob, it even came to pass, just when Jacob had gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he also had made meats and brought them to his father; and he said to his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy firstborn son Esau.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Isaac was amazed with very great amazement, and said, Who then is it that has procured venison for me and brought it to me? and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Esau heard the words of his father Isaac, he cried out with a great and very bitter cry, and said, Bless, I pray thee, me also, father.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he said to him, Thy brother has come with subtlety, and taken thy blessing.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he said, Rightly was his name called Jacob, for lo! this second time has he supplanted me; he has both taken my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing; and Esau said to his father, Hast thou not left a blessing for me, father?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Isaac answered and said to Esau, If I have made him thy lord, and have made all his brethren his servants, and have strengthened him with corn and wine, what then shall I do for thee, son?   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Esau said to his father, Hast thou <span class='add'>only</span> one blessing, father? Bless, I pray thee, me also, father. And Isaac being troubled, Esau cried aloud and wept.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And Isaac his father answered and said to him,  </div><div class='q'>Behold, thy dwelling shall be of the fatness of the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And of the dew of heaven from above.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And thou shalt live by thy sword,  </div><div class='q'>And shalt serve thy brother;  </div><div class='q'>And there shall be <span class='add'>a time</span> when thou shalt break  </div><div class='q'>And loosen his yoke from off thy neck.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Esau was angry with Jacob because of the blessing, with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his mind, Let the days of my father’s mourning draw nigh, that I may slay my brother Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And the words of Esau her elder son were reported to Rebekah, and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, Esau thy brother threatens thee to kill thee.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Now then, my son, hear my voice, and rise and depart quickly into Mesopotamia to Laban my brother into Haran.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And dwell with him certain days, until thy brother’s anger   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>and rage depart from thee, and he forget what thou hast done to him; and I will send and fetch thee thence, lest at any time I should be bereaved of you both in one day.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of the sons of Heth; if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of this land, wherefore should I live?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
