And the lice were both on the men and on the quadrupeds.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So the charmers said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he hearkened not to them, as the Lord said.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh: and, behold, he will go forth to the water, and thou shalt say to him, These things says the Lord: Send away my people, that they may serve me in the wilderness.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I send upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and upon your houses, the dog fly; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be filled with the dog fly, even throughout the land upon which they are.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I will distinguish marvelously in that day the land of Goshen, on which my people dwell, in which the dog fly shall not be: that thou mayest know that I am the Lord the God of all the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I will put a difference between my people and thy people, and on the morrow shall this be on the land. And the Lord did thus.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the dog fly came in abundance into the houses of Pharaoh, and into the houses of his servants, and into all the land of Egypt; and the land was destroyed by the dog fly.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go and sacrifice to the Lord your God in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Moses said, It cannot be so, for we shall sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians; for if we sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we shall be stoned.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>We will go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord our God, as the Lord said to us.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Pharaoh said, I <span class='add'>will</span> let you go, and do ye sacrifice to your God in the wilderness, but do not go very far away: pray then for me to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, I then will go forth from thee and pray to God, and the dog fly shall depart both from thy servants, and from thy people tomorrow. Do not thou, Pharaoh, deceive again, so as not to send the people away to do sacrifice to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to God.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord did as Moses said, and removed the dog fly from Pharaoh, and from his servants, and from his people, and there was not one left.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Pharaoh hardened his heart, even on this occasion, and he would not send the people away.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
