and remember that I am your bone and your flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And his mother’s brethren spoke concerning him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words; and their heart turned after Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they gave him seventy <span class='add'>pieces</span> of silver out of the house of Baal-berith; and Abimelech hired for himself vain and cowardly men, and they went after him.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he went to the house of his father to Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men upon one stone; but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all the men of Shechem, and all the house of Beth-millo, were gathered together, and they went and made Abimelech king by the oak of Sedition, which was at Shechem.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it was reported to Jotham, and he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and wept, and said to them, Hear me, ye men of Shechem, and God shall hear you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive, Reign over us.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But the olive said to them, Shall I leave my fatness, with which men shall glorify God, and go to be promoted over the trees?   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come, reign over us.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But the fig tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruits, and go to be promoted over the trees?
