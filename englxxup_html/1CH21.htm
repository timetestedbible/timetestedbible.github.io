<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 21</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the devil stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And King David said to Joab and to the captains of the forces, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan, and bring me <span class='add'>the account</span>, and I shall know their number.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Joab said, May the Lord add to his people, a hundredfold as many as they <span class='add'>are</span>, and <span class='add'>let</span> the eyes of my lord the king see <span class='add'>it</span>: all <span class='add'>are</span> the servants of my lord. Why does my lord seek this thing? <span class='add'>do it not</span>, lest it become a sin to Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab; and Joab went out and passed through all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to David: and all Israel was a million and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and the sons of Judah <span class='add'>were</span> four hundred and seventy thousand men that drew sword.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But he numbered not Levi and Benjamin among them; for the word of the king was painful to Joab.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>there was</span> evil in the sight of the Lord respecting this thing; and he smote Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And David said to God, I have sinned exceedingly, in that I have done this thing: and now, I pray thee, remove the sin of thy servant; for I have been exceedingly foolish.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Go and speak to David, saying, Thus saith the Lord, I bring three things upon thee: choose one of them for thyself, and I will do it to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Choose for thyself,   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>either three years of famine, or that thou shouldest flee three months from the face of thine enemies, and the sword of thine enemies <span class='add'>shall be employed</span> to destroy thee, or that the sword of the Lord and pestilence <span class='add'>should be</span> three days in the land, and the angel of the Lord <span class='add'>shall be</span> destroying in all the inheritance of Israel. And now consider what I shall answer to him that sent the message.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David said to Gad, They are very hard for me, even <span class='add'>all</span> the three: let me fall now into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies <span class='add'>are</span> very abundant, and let me not fall by any means into the hands of man.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So the Lord brought pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the Lord saw, and repented for the evil, and said to the angel that was destroying, Let it suffice thee; withhold thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord, standing between the earth and the heaven, and his sword drawn in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem: and David and the elders clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And David said to God, <span class='add'>Was it</span> not I <span class='add'>that</span> gave orders to number the people? and I am the guilty one; I have greatly sinned: but these sheep, what have they done? O Lord God, let thy hand be upon me, and upon my father’s house, and not on thy people for destruction, O Lord!   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David, that he should go up to erect an altar to the Lord, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he spoke in the name of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ornan turned and saw the king; and he hid himself and his four sons with him. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David came to Ornan; and Ornan came forth from the threshing floor, and did obeisance to David with his face to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David said to Ornan, Give me thy place of the threshing floor, and I will build upon it an altar to the Lord: give it me for its worth in money, and the plague shall cease from <span class='add'>among</span> the people.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Ornan said to David, Take it to thyself, and let my lord the king do what is right in his eyes: see, I have given the calves for a whole burnt offering, and the plow for wood, and the corn for a meat offering; I have given all.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And King David said to Ornan, Nay; for I will surely buy it for its worth in money: for I will not take thy property for the Lord, to offer a whole burnt offering to the Lord without cost <span class='add'>to myself</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And David gave to Ornan for his place six hundred shekels of gold <span class='add'>by</span> weight.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And David built there an altar to the Lord, and offered up whole burnt offerings and peace offerings: and he cried to the Lord, and he answered him by fire out of heaven on the altar of whole burnt offerings, and <span class='add'>it</span> consumed the whole burnt offering.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the Lord spoke to the angel; and he put up the sword into its sheath.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>At that time when David saw that the Lord answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he also sacrificed there.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the tabernacle of the Lord which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of whole burnt offerings, <span class='add'>were</span> at that time in the high place at Gibeon.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he hastened not because of the sword of the angel of the Lord.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
