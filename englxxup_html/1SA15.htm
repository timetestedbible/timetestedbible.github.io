So the Kenite departed from the midst of Amalek.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah to Shur fronting Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and he slew all the people and Hierim with the edge of the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse thing they destroyed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I have repented that I have made Saul to be king: for he has turned back from following me, and has not kept my word. And Samuel was grieved, and cried to the Lord all night.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Samuel rose early and went to meet Israel in the morning, and it was told Saul, saying, Samuel has come to Carmel, and he has raised up help for himself: and he turned his chariot, and came down to Gilgal to Saul; and, behold, he was offering up a whole burnt offering to the Lord, the chief of the spoils which he brought out of Amalek.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed <span class='add'>art</span> thou of the Lord: I have performed all that the Lord said.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Samuel said, What then <span class='add'>is</span> the bleating of this flock in my ears, and the sound of the oxen which I hear?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Saul said, I have brought them out of Amalek, that which the people preserved, even the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, that it might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, and the rest have I utterly destroyed.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night: and he said to him, Say on.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Art thou not little in his eyes, <span class='add'>though</span> a leader of one of the tribes of Israel? and <span class='add'>yet</span> the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said to thee, Go, and utterly destroy: thou shalt slay the sinners against me, <span class='add'>even</span> the Amalekites; and thou shalt war against them until thou have consumed them.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And why didst not thou hearken to the voice of the Lord, but didst hasten to fasten upon the spoils, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalek, and I destroyed Amalek.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds <span class='add'>out</span> of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Gilgal.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience <span class='add'>is</span> better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For sin is <span class='add'>as</span> divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject thee from being king over Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and thy direction; for I feared the people, and I hearkened to their voice.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And now remove, I pray thee, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject thee from being king over Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his garment, and tore it.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Samuel said to him, The Lord has rent thy kingdom from Israel out of thy hand this day, and will give it to thy neighbor who is better than thou.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Israel shall be divided to two: and <span class='add'>God</span> will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honor me, I pray thee, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshiped the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalek: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said, Is death thus bitter?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Agag, As thy sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall thy mother be made childless among women: and Samuel slew Agag before the Lord in Gilgal.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Samuel departed to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house at Gibeah.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
