<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I myself also am a mortal man, like to all,  </div><div class='q'>And the offspring of him that was first made of the earth,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And in my mother’s womb was fashioned to be flesh  </div><div class='q'>In the time of ten months, being compacted in blood,  </div><div class='q'>Of the seed of man, and the pleasure that came with sleep.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And when I was born, I drew in the common air,  </div><div class='q'>And fell upon the earth, which is of like nature,  </div><div class='q'>And the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me:  </div><div class='q'>I called <span class='add'>upon God</span>, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I preferred her before scepters and thrones,  </div><div class='q'>And esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Neither compared I unto her any precious stone,  </div><div class='q'>Because all gold in respect of her is as a little sand,  </div><div class='q'>And silver shall be counted as clay before her.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I loved her above health and beauty,  </div><div class='q'>And chose to have her instead of light:  </div><div class='q'>For the light that cometh from her never goeth out.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>All good things together came to me with her,  </div><div class='q'>And innumerable riches in her hands.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And I rejoiced in <span class='add'>them</span> all, because wisdom goeth before them:  </div><div class='q'>And I knew not that she was the mother of them.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>I learned diligently, and do communicate <span class='add'>her</span> liberally:  </div><div class='q'>I do not hide her riches.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth:  </div><div class='q'>Which they that use become the friends of God,  </div><div class='q'>Being commended for the gifts that come from learning.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>God hath granted me to speak as I would,  </div><div class='q'>And to conceive as is meet for the things that are given me:  </div><div class='q'>Because it is he that leadeth unto wisdom,  </div><div class='q'>And directeth the wise.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For in his hand are both we and our words;  </div><div class='q'>All wisdom also, and knowledge of workmanship.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things that are,  </div><div class='q'>Namely, to know how the world was made, and the operation of the elements:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The beginning, ending, and midst of the times:  </div><div class='q'>The alterations of the turning <span class='add'>of the sun</span>, and change of seasons:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>The circuits of years, and positions of stars:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wild beasts:  </div><div class='q'>The violence of winds, and the reasonings of men:  </div><div class='q'>The diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all such things as are either secret or manifest, <span class='add'>them</span> I know.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me:  </div><div class='q'>For in her is an understanding spirit, holy,  </div><div class='q'>One only, manifold, subtle,  </div><div class='q'>Lively, clear, undefiled,  </div><div class='q'>Plain, not subject to hurt, loving the thing that is good, quick,  </div><div class='q'>Which cannot be letted, ready to do good,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>kind to man,  </div><div class='q'>Steadfast, sure, free from care,  </div><div class='q'>Having all power, overseeing all things,  </div><div class='q'>And going through all understanding,  </div><div class='q'>Pure, and most subtle, spirits.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For wisdom is more moving than any motion:  </div><div class='q'>She passeth and goeth through all things by reason of her pureness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For she is the breath of the power of God,  </div><div class='q'>And a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty:  </div><div class='q'>Therefore can no defiled thing fall into her.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For she is the brightness of the everlasting light,  </div><div class='q'>The unspotted mirror of the power of God,  </div><div class='q'>And the image of his goodness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And being but one, she can do all things:  </div><div class='q'>And remaining in herself, she maketh all things new:  </div><div class='q'>And in all ages entering into holy souls,  </div><div class='q'>She maketh them friends of God, and prophets.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For she is more beautiful than the sun,  </div><div class='q'>And above all the order of stars:  </div><div class='q'>Being compared with the light, she is found before it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For after this cometh night:  </div><div class='q'>But vice shall not prevail against wisdom.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
