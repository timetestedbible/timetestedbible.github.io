<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 14</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to pass through the raging waves,  </div><div class='q'>Calleth upon a piece of wood more rotten than the vessel that carrieth him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For verily desire of gain devised that,  </div><div class='q'>And the workman built it by his skill.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But thy providence, O Father, governeth it:  </div><div class='q'>For thou hast made a way in the sea,  </div><div class='q'>And a safe path in the waves;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Showing that thou canst save from all danger:  </div><div class='q'>Yea, though a man went to sea without art.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdom should be idle,  </div><div class='q'>And therefore do men commit their lives to a small piece of wood,  </div><div class='q'>And passing the rough sea in a weak vessel are saved.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished,  </div><div class='q'>The hope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel,  </div><div class='q'>And left to all ages a seed of generation.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, as he that made it:  </div><div class='q'>He, because he made it: and it, because, being corruptible, it was called God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hateful unto God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For that which is made shall be punished together with him that made it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there be a visitation:  </div><div class='q'>Because in the creature of God they are become an abomination,  </div><div class='q'>And stumbling blocks to the souls of men,  </div><div class='q'>And a snare to the feet of the unwise.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For the devising of idols was the beginning of <span class='add'>spiritual</span> fornication,  </div><div class='q'>And the invention of them the corruption of life.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be forever.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world,  </div><div class='q'>And therefore shall they come shortly to an end.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For a father afflicted with untimely mourning,  </div><div class='q'>When he hath made an image of his child soon taken away,  </div><div class='q'>Now honored him as a god, which was then a dead man,  </div><div class='q'>And delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong was kept as a law,  </div><div class='q'>And graven images were worshiped by the commandments of kings.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whom men could not honor in presence, because they dwelt far off,  </div><div class='q'>They took the counterfeit of his visage from far,  </div><div class='q'>And made an express image of a king whom they honored,  </div><div class='q'>To the end that by this their forwardness they might flatter him that was absent, as if he were present.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Also the singular diligence of the artificer  </div><div class='q'>Did help to set forward the ignorant to more superstition.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority,  </div><div class='q'>Forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the best fashion.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work,  </div><div class='q'>Took him now for a god, which a little before was but honored as a man.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And this was an occasion to deceive the world:  </div><div class='q'>For men, serving either calamity or tyranny,  </div><div class='q'>Did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in the knowledge of God;  </div><div class='q'>But whereas they lived in the great war of ignorance,  </div><div class='q'>Those so great plagues called they peace.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For while they slew their children in sacrifices, or used secret ceremonies,  </div><div class='q'>Or made revelings of strange rites;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled:  </div><div class='q'>But either one slew another traitorously or grieved him by adultery.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So that there reigned in all men without exception, blood, manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation,  </div><div class='q'>Corruption, unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns,  </div><div class='q'>Defiling of souls, changing of kind,  </div><div class='q'>Disorder in marriages, adultery, and shameless uncleanness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For the worshiping of idols not to be named  </div><div class='q'>Is the beginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies,  </div><div class='q'>Or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>For insomuch as their trust is in idols which have no life,  </div><div class='q'>Though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished:  </div><div class='q'>Both because they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols,  </div><div class='q'>And also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For it is not the power of them by whom they swear:  </div><div class='q'>But it is the just vengeance of sinners,  </div><div class='q'>That punisheth always the offense of the ungodly.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
