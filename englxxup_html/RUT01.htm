Not so, my daughters; for I am grieved for you, that the hand of the Lord has gone forth against me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And they lifted up their voice, and wept again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law and returned to her people; but Ruth followed her.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Naomi said to Ruth, Behold, thy sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; turn now thou also after thy sister-in-law.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee; for whithersoever thou goest, I will go, and wheresoever thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people <span class='add'>shall be</span> my people, and thy God my God.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And wherever thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, <span class='add'>if I leave thee</span>, for death <span class='add'>only</span> shall divide between me and thee.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Naomi seeing that she was determined to go with her, ceased to speak to her anymore.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they went both of them until they came to Bethlehem: and it came to pass, when they arrived at Bethlehem, that all the city rang with them, and they said, Is this Naomi?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said to them, Nay, do not call me Naomi; call me Bitter, for the Mighty One has dealt very bitterly with me.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I went out full, and the Lord has brought me back empty: and why call ye me Naomi, whereas the Lord has humbled me, and the Mighty One has afflicted me?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>So Naomi and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, returned from the country of Moab; and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
