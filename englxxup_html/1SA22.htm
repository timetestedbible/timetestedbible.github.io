So David went, and came and dwelt in the city of Hereth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul dwelt in the hill below the field that is in Ramah, and his spear <span class='add'>was</span> in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jesse indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>that ye are all conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jesse, and there is no one of you that is sorry for me, or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as <span class='add'>it is</span> this day?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Doeg the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul answered and said, I saw the son of Jesse as he came to Nob to Ahimelech son of Ahitub the priest.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>the priest</span> inquired of God for him, and gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the king sent to call Ahimelech son of Ahitub and all his father’s sons, the priests that were in Nob; and they all came to the king.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he said, Lo! I <span class='add'>am here</span>, speak, <span class='add'>my</span> lord.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Saul said to him, Why have thou and the son of Jesse conspired against me, that thou shouldest give him bread and a sword, and shouldest inquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as <span class='add'>he is</span> this day?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he answered the king, and said, And who <span class='add'>is</span> there among all thy servants faithful as David, and <span class='add'>he is</span> a son-in-law of the king, and <span class='add'>he is</span> executor of all thy commands, and <span class='add'>is</span> honorable in thy house?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Have I begun today to inquire of God for him? by no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against the whole of my father’s house; for thy servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And King Saul said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father’s house.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw nigh and slay the priests of the Lord, because their hand <span class='add'>is</span> with David, and because they knew that he fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priests of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests: and Doeg the Syrian turned, and slew the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he smote Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both man and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And one son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escapes, and his name <span class='add'>was</span> Abiathar, and he fled after David.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doeg the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the death of the house of thy father.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place <span class='add'>of safety</span> for my life, I will also seek a place for thy life, for thou art safely guarded <span class='add'>while</span> with me.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
