<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And it came to pass on a certain day,  </div><div class='q'>That the angels of God came to stand before the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And the devil came among them  </div><div class='q'>To stand before the Lord.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Lord said to the devil, Whence comest thou?  </div><div class='q'>Then the devil said before the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>I am come from going through the world, and walking about the whole earth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the Lord said to the devil,  </div><div class='q'>Hast thou then observed my servant Job,  </div><div class='q'>That there is none of <span class='add'>men</span> upon the earth like him,  </div><div class='q'>A harmless, true, blameless, godly man,  </div><div class='q'>Abstaining from all evil?  </div><div class='q'>And he yet cleaves to innocence,  </div><div class='q'>Whereas thou hast told <span class='add'>me</span> to destroy his substance without cause?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And the devil answered and said to the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>Skin for skin,  </div><div class='q'>All that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Nay, but put forth thy hand, and touch his bones and his flesh:  </div><div class='q'>Verily he will curse thee to <span class='add'>thy</span> face.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I deliver him up to thee;  </div><div class='q'>Only save his life.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So the devil went out from the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And smote Job with sore boils from <span class='add'>his</span> feet to <span class='add'>his</span> head.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he took a potsherd to scrape away the discharge,  </div><div class='q'>And sat upon a dungheap outside the city.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And when much time had passed, his wife said to him,  </div><div class='q'>How long wilt thou hold out, saying,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">9a&#160;</span>Behold, I wait yet a little while,  </div><div class='q'>Expecting the hope of my deliverance?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">9b&#160;</span>For, behold, thy memorial is abolished from the earth,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Even thy</span> sons and daughters, the pangs and pains of my womb  </div><div class='q'>Which I bore in vain with sorrows;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">9c&#160;</span>And thou thyself sittest down to spend the nights in the open air among the corruption of worms,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">9d&#160;</span>And I am a wanderer and a servant  </div><div class='q'>From place to place and house to house,  </div><div class='q'>Waiting for the setting of the sun,  </div><div class='q'>That I may rest from my labors and my pangs which now beset me:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">9e&#160;</span>But say some word against the Lord, and die.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>But he looked on her, and said to her,  </div><div class='q'>Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women.  </div><div class='q'>If we have received good things of the hand of the Lord, shall we not endure evil things?  </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'>In all these things that happened to him,  </div><div class='q'>Job sinned not at all with his lips before God.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now his three friends having heard of all the evil that was come upon him,  </div><div class='q'>Came to him each from his own country:  </div><div class='q'>Eliphaz the king of the Temanites,  </div><div class='q'>Bildad sovereign of the Shuhites,  </div><div class='q'>Zophar king of the Minaeans:  </div><div class='q'>And they came to him with one accord,  </div><div class='q'>To comfort and to visit him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And when they saw him from a distance they did not know him;  </div><div class='q'>And they cried with a loud voice, and wept,  </div><div class='q'>And rent every one his garment,  </div><div class='q'>And sprinkled dust upon <span class='add'>their heads</span>,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they sat down beside him seven days and seven nights,  </div><div class='q'>And no one of them spoke;  </div><div class='q'>For they saw that <span class='add'>his</span> affliction was dreadful and very great.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
