</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger,  </div><div class='q'>He perished also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood, wisdom again preserved it,  </div><div class='q'>And directed the course of the righteous in a piece of wood of small value.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy being confounded,  </div><div class='q'>She found out the righteous, and preserved him blameless unto God,  </div><div class='q'>And kept him strong against his tender compassion toward his son.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man,  </div><div class='q'>Who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Of whose wickedness, even to this day the waste land that smoketh is a testimony,  </div><div class='q'>And plants bearing fruit that never come to ripeness:  </div><div class='q'>And a standing pillar of salt is a monument of an unbelieving soul.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For regarding not wisdom,  </div><div class='q'>They got not only this hurt, that they knew not the things which were good;  </div><div class='q'>But also left behind them to the world a memorial of their foolishness:  </div><div class='q'>So that in the things wherein they offended they could not so much as be hidden.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>But wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>When the righteous fled from his brother’s wrath,  </div><div class='q'>She guided him in right paths, showed him the kingdom of God,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him knowledge of holy things,  </div><div class='q'>Made him rich in his travails,  </div><div class='q'>And multiplied <span class='add'>the fruit of</span> his labors.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood by him,  </div><div class='q'>And made him rich.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>She defended him from his enemies,  </div><div class='q'>And kept him safe from those that lay in wait,  </div><div class='q'>And in a sore conflict she gave him the victory;  </div><div class='q'>That he might know that godliness is stronger than all.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not,  </div><div class='q'>But delivered him from sin:  </div><div class='q'>She went down with him into the pit,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And left him not in bonds,  </div><div class='q'>Till she brought him the scepter of the kingdom,  </div><div class='q'>And power against those that oppressed him:  </div><div class='q'>As for them that had accused him, she showed them to be liars,  </div><div class='q'>And gave him perpetual glory.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed  </div><div class='q'>From the nation that oppressed them.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And withstood dreadful kings in wonders and signs;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labors,  </div><div class='q'>Guided them in a marvelous way,  </div><div class='q'>And was unto them for a cover by day,  </div><div class='q'>And a light of stars in the night season;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Brought them through the Red Sea,  </div><div class='q'>And led them through much water:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But she drowned their enemies,  </div><div class='q'>And cast them up out of the bottom of the deep.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly,  </div><div class='q'>And praised thy holy name, O Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And magnified with one accord thy hand, that fought for them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb,  </div><div class='q'>And made the tongues of them that cannot speak eloquent.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
