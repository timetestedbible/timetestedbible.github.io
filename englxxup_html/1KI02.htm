And she said to him, Say on.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to her, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel turned their face toward me for a king; but the kingdom was turned <span class='add'>from me</span> and became my brother’s: for it was <span class='add'>appointed</span> to him from the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now I make one request of thee, do not turn away thy face. And Bathsheba said to him, Speak <span class='add'>on</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said to her, Speak, I pray thee, to King Solomon, for he will not turn away his face from thee, and let him give me Abishag the Shunammite for a wife.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee to the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Bathsheba went in to King Solomon to speak to him concerning Adonijah; and the king rose up to meet her, and kissed her, and sat on the throne, and a throne was set for the mother of the king, and she sat on his right hand.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she said to him, I ask of thee one little request; turn not away my face from thee. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, and I will not reject thee.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And she said, Let, I pray thee, Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And King Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why hast thou asked Abishag for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he <span class='add'>is</span> my elder brother, and he has for his companion Abiathar the priest, and Joab the son of Zeruiah the commander-in-chief.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me, and more also, <span class='add'>if it be not</span> that Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And now <span class='add'>as</span> the Lord lives who has established me, and set me on the throne of my father David, and he has made me a house, as the Lord spoke, this day shall Adonijah be put to death.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>So King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he slew him, and Adonijah died in that day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Depart thou quickly to Anathoth to thy farm, for thou art worthy of death this day; but I will not slay thee, because thou hast borne the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father, and because thou wast afflicted in all things wherein my father was afflicted.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Solomon removed Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, that the word of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the report came to Joab son of Zeruiah; for Joab had turned after Adonijah, and he went not after Solomon: and Joab fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And it was told Solomon, saying, Joab has fled to the tabernacle of the Lord, and lo! he has hold of the horns of the altar. And King Solomon sent to Joab, saying, What ails thee, that thou hast fled to the altar? and Joab said, Because I was afraid of thee, and fled for refuge to the Lord. And Solomon sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada, saying, Go and slay him, and bury him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And Benaiah son of Jehoiada came to Joab to the tabernacle of the Lord, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And Joab said, I will not come forth, for I will die here. And Benaiah son of Jehoiada returned and spoke to the king, saying, Thus has Joab spoken, and thus has he answered me.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the king said to him, Go, and do to him as he has spoken, and kill him: and thou shalt bury him, and thou shalt remove this day the blood which he shed without cause, from me and from the house of my father.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the Lord has returned upon his own head the blood of his unrighteousness, inasmuch as he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself, and slew them with the sword, and my father David knew not of their blood, <span class='add'>even</span> Abner the son of Ner the commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether the commander-in-chief of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And their blood is returned upon his head, and upon the head of his seed forever: but to David, and his seed, and his house, and his throne, may there be peace forever from the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>So Benaiah son of Jehoiada went up, and attacked him, and slew him, and buried him in his house in the wilderness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in his place over the host; and the kingdom was established in Jerusalem; and <span class='add'>as for</span> Zadok the priest, the king appointed him to be high priest in the room of Abiathar. And Solomon son of David reigned over Israel and Judah in Jerusalem:   <span class="verse" id="V36">35a&#160;</span>and the Lord gave understanding to Solomon, and very much wisdom, and largeness of heart, as the sand by the seashore.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">35b&#160;</span>And the wisdom of Solomon abounded exceedingly beyond the wisdom of all the ancients, and beyond all the wise men of Egypt;   <span class="verse" id="V38">35c&#160;</span>and he took the daughter of Pharaoh, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the Lord first, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. In seven years he made and finished <span class='add'>them</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">35d&#160;</span>And Solomon had seventy thousand bearers of burdens, and eighty thousand hewers of stone in the mountain:   <span class="verse" id="V40">35e&#160;</span>and Solomon made the sea, and the bases, and the great lavers, and the pillars, and the fountain of the court, and the brazen sea—and he built the citadel as a defense above it, he made a breach in the wall of the city of David;   <span class="verse" id="V41">35f&#160;</span>thus the daughter of Pharaoh went up out of the city of David to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel;   <span class="verse" id="V42">35g&#160;</span>and Solomon offered up three whole burnt offerings in the year, and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the Lord, and he burned incense before the Lord, and finished the house.   <span class="verse" id="V43">35h&#160;</span>And these <span class='add'>are</span> the chief persons who presided over the works of Solomon; three thousand and six hundred masters of the people that wrought the works.   <span class="verse" id="V44">35i&#160;</span>And he built Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer, and upper Beth-horon, and Baalath:   <span class="verse" id="V45">35k&#160;</span>only after he had built the house of the Lord, and the wall of Jerusalem round about, afterward he built these cities.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">35l&#160;</span>And when David was yet living, he charged Solomon, saying, Behold, <span class='add'>there is</span> with thee Shimei the son of Gera, of the seed of Benjamin out of Hebron:   <span class="verse" id="V47">35m&#160;</span>he cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went into the camp;   <span class="verse" id="V48">35n&#160;</span>and he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, He shall not be slain with the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V49">35o&#160;</span>But now do not thou hold him guiltless, for thou <span class='add'>art</span> a man of understanding, and thou wilt know what thou shalt do to him, and thou shalt bring down his gray hairs with blood to the grave.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And the king called Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go out thence any whither.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass in the day that thou shalt go forth and cross over the brook Kidron, know assuredly that thou shalt certainly die: thy blood shall be upon thy head. And the king caused him to swear in that day.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Shimei said to the king, Good <span class='add'>is</span> the word that thou hast spoken, my lord O king: thus will thy servant do.
