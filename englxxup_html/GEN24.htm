I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of them that inhabit the city come forth to draw water.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it shall be, the virgin to whomsoever I shall say, Incline thy waterpot, that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink thou, and I will give thy camels drink, until they shall have done drinking—even this one thou hast prepared for thy servant Isaac, and hereby shall I know that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master Abraham.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And it came to pass before he had done speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebekah the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, and <span class='add'>the same</span> the brother of Abraham, came forth, having a waterpot on her shoulders.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the virgin was very beautiful in appearance, she was a virgin, a man had not known her; and she went down to the well, and filled her waterpot, and came up.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the servant ran up to meet her, and said, Give me a little water to drink out of thy pitcher;   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and she said, Drink, Sir; and she hastened, and let down the pitcher upon her arm, and gave him to drink, till he ceased drinking.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And she said, I will also draw water for thy camels, till they shall all have drunk.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And she hastened, and emptied the waterpot into the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the camels.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the man took great notice of her, and remained silent to know whether the Lord had made his way prosperous or not.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass when all the camels ceased drinking, that the man took golden earrings, each of a drachma weight, and he <span class='add'>put</span> two bracelets on her hands, their weight was ten pieces of gold.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me if there is room for us to lodge with thy father.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And she said to him, We have both straw and much provender, and a place for resting.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the man being well pleased, worshiped the Lord,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and said, Blessed be the Lord the God of my master Abraham, who has not suffered his righteousness to fail, nor his truth from my master, and the Lord has brought me prosperously to the house of the brother of my lord.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the damsel ran and reported to the house of her mother according to these words.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to meet the man, to the well.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass when he saw the earrings and the bracelets on the hands of his sister, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus the man spoke to me, that he went to the man, as he stood by the camels at the well.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said to him, Come in hither, thou blessed of the Lord, why standest thou without, whereas I have prepared the house and a place for the camels?   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the man entered into the house, and unloaded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men that were with him.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he set before them loaves to eat; but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand.

And he arose in the morning and said, Send me away, that I may go to my master.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>And her brethren and her mother said, Let the virgin remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall depart.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>But he said to them, Hinder me not, for the Lord has prospered my journey for me; send me away, that I may depart to my master.   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>And they said, Let us call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? and she said, I will go.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>So they sent forth Rebekah their sister, and her goods, and the servant of Abraham, and his attendants.   <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Thou art our sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and let thy seed possess the cities of their enemies.   <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And Rebekah rose up and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went with the man; and the servant having taken up Rebekah, departed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And Isaac went through the wilderness to the well of the vision, and he dwelt in the land toward the south.   <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>And Isaac went forth into the plain toward evening to meditate; and having lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming.   <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac; and she alighted briskly from the camel,   <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>and said to the servant, Who is that man that walks in the plain to meet us?
