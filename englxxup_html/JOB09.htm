<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 9</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Then Job answered and said,   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I know of a truth that it is so:  </div><div class='q'>For how shall a mortal man be just before the Lord?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For if he would enter into judgment with him,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>God</span> would not hearken to him,  </div><div class='q'>So that he should answer to one of his charges of a thousand.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For he is wise in mind, and mighty, and great:  </div><div class='q'>Who has hardened himself against him and endured?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who wears out the mountains, and <span class='add'>men</span> know it not:  </div><div class='q'>Who overturns them in anger.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Who shakes the <span class='add'>earth</span> under heaven from its foundations,  </div><div class='q'>And its pillars totter.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Who commands the sun, and it rises not;  </div><div class='q'>And he seals up the stars.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Who alone has stretched out the heavens,  </div><div class='q'>And walks on the sea as on firm ground.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Who makes Pleiades, and Hesperus, and Arcturus, and the chambers of the south.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Who does great and unsearchable things;  </div><div class='q'>Glorious also and excellent things, innumerable.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>If ever he should go beyond me, I shall not see him:  </div><div class='q'>If he should pass by me, neither thus have I known <span class='add'>it</span>.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If he would take away, who shall turn him back?  </div><div class='q'>Or who shall say to him, What hast thou done?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>if</span> he has turned away <span class='add'>his</span> anger,  </div><div class='q'>The whales under heaven have stooped under him.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Oh then that he would hearken to me, or judge my cause.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For though I be righteous, he will not hearken to me:  </div><div class='q'>I will entreat his judgment.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And if I should call and he should not hearken,  </div><div class='q'>I cannot believe that he has listened to my voice.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Let him not crush me with a dark storm:  </div><div class='q'>But he has made my bruises many without cause.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For he suffers me not to take breath,  </div><div class='q'>But he has filled me with bitterness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For indeed he is strong in power:  </div><div class='q'>Who then shall resist his judgment?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For though I should seem righteous, my mouth will be profane:  </div><div class='q'>And though I should seem blameless, I shall be proved perverse.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For even if I have sinned, I know it not <span class='add'>in</span> my soul:  </div><div class='q'>But my life is taken away.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Wherefore I said, Wrath slays the great and mighty man.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For the worthless die,  </div><div class='q'>But the righteous are laughed to scorn.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they are delivered into the hands of the unrighteous <span class='add'>man</span>:  </div><div class='q'>He covers the faces of the judges <span class='add'>of the earth</span>:  </div><div class='q'>But if it be not he, who is it?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>But my life is swifter than a post:  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>My days</span> have fled away, and they knew it not.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Or again, is there a trace of <span class='add'>their</span> path <span class='add'>left</span> by ships?  </div><div class='q'>Or is there one of the flying eagle as it seeks <span class='add'>its</span> prey?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And if I should say, I will forget to speak,  </div><div class='q'>I will bow down my face and groan;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>I quake in all my limbs,  </div><div class='q'>For I know that thou wilt not leave me alone <span class='add'>as</span> innocent.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But since I am ungodly, why have I not died?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>For if I should wash myself with snow,  </div><div class='q'>And purge myself with pure hands,   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thou hadst thoroughly plunged me in filth,  </div><div class='q'>And my garment had abhorred me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For thou art not man like me, with whom I could contend,  </div><div class='q'>That we might come together to judgment.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Would that <span class='add'>he</span> our mediator were <span class='add'>present</span>, and a reprover,  </div><div class='q'>And one who should hear <span class='add'>the cause</span> between both.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Let him remove <span class='add'>his</span> rod from me,  </div><div class='q'>And let not his fear terrify me:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>So shall I not be afraid, but I will speak:  </div><div class='q'>For I am not thus conscious <span class='add'>of guilt</span>.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
