<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 45</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, heard the words which Jeremiah spoke to the people, saying,   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord; He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine: but he that goes out to the Chaldeans shall live; and his soul shall be given him for a found treasure, and he shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the host of the king of Babylon, and they shall take it.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they said to the king, Let that man, we pray thee, be slain, for he weakens the hands of the fighting men that are left in the city, and the hands of all the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man does not prophesy peace to this people, but evil.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then the king said, Behold, he is in your hands. For the king could not resist them.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And they cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the court of the prison; and they let him down into the pit: and there was no water in the pit, but mire: and he was in the mire.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian heard (now he was in the king’s household), that they <span class='add'>had</span> put Jeremiah into the dungeon; and the king was in the gate of Benjamin:   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and he went forth to him, and spoke to the king and said,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Thou hast done evil in what thou hast done to slay this man with hunger: for there is no more bread in the city.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king commanded Ebed-melech, saying, Take with thee hence thirty men, and bring him up out of the dungeon, that he die not.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>So Ebed-melech took the men, and went into the underground <span class='add'>part of the</span> king’s house, and took thence old rags and old ropes, and threw them to Jeremiah into the dungeon.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he said, Put these under the ropes. And Jeremiah did so.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they drew him with the ropes, and lifted him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Then the king sent, and called him to himself into the house of Aselisel, which was in the house of the Lord: and the king said to him, I will ask thee a question, and I pray thee hide nothing from me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Jeremiah said to the king, If I tell thee, wilt thou not certainly put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not at all hearken to me.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the king swore to him, saying, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives who gave us this soul, I will not slay thee, neither will I give thee into the hands of these men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Jeremiah said to him, Thus saith the Lord; If thou wilt indeed go forth to the captains of the king of Babylon, thy soul shall live, and this city shall certainly not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But if thou wilt not go forth, this city shall be delivered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt by no means escape.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the king said to Jeremiah, I consider the Jews that have gone over to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands, and they mock me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jeremiah said, They shall in nowise deliver thee up. Hear the word of the Lord which I speak to thee; and it shall be better for thee, and thy soul shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the Lord has shown me.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And, behold, all the women that are left in the house of the king of Judah were brought forth to the princes of the king of Babylon; and they said, The men who were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and will prevail against thee; and they shall cause thy foot to slide and fail, they have turned back from thee.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they shall bring forth thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt by no means escape, for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Then the king said to him, Let no man know <span class='add'>any</span> of these words, and certainly thou shalt not die.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And if the princes shall hear that I have spoken to thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Tell us, what said the king to thee? hide <span class='add'>it</span> not from us, and we will in nowise slay thee, and what said the king to thee?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then thou shalt say to them, I brought my supplication before the presence of the king, that he would not send me back into the house of Jonathan, that I should die there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words, which the king had commanded him. And they were silent, because the word of the Lord was not heard.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison, until the time when Jerusalem was taken.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
