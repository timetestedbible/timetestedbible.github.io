neither did I choose a man to be a leader over my people Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But I chose Jerusalem that my name should be there; and I chose David to be over my people Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came into the heart of David my father, to build a house for the name of the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>But the Lord said to my father David, Whereas it came into thy heart to build a house for my name, thou didst well that it came into thy heart.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; for thy son who shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord has confirmed this word, which he spoke; and I am raised up in the room of my father David, and I sit upon the throne of Israel as the Lord said, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord God of Israel:   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and I have set there the ark in which <span class='add'>is</span> the covenant of the Lord, which he made with Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread out his hands.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For Solomon <span class='add'>had</span> made a brazen scaffold, and set it in the midst of the court of the sanctuary; the length of it <span class='add'>was</span> five cubits, and the breadth of it five cubits, and the height of it three cubits: and he stood upon it, and fell upon his knees before the whole congregation of Israel, and spread abroad his hands to heaven,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and said,  </div><div class='p'>Lord God of Israel, there is no God like thee in heaven, or on the earth; keeping covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with <span class='add'>their</span> whole heart.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Even as thou hast kept <span class='add'>them</span> with thy servant David my father, as thou hast spoken to him in words—thou hast both spoken with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled <span class='add'>it</span> with thy hands, as it is this day.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now, Lord God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father the things which thou spokest to him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man before me sitting on the throne of Israel, if only thy sons will take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou didst walk before me.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And now, Lord God of Israel, let, I pray thee, thy word be confirmed, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For will God indeed dwell with men upon the earth? if the heaven and the heaven of heavens will not suffice thee, what then is this house which I have built?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Yet thou shalt have respect to the prayer of thy servant, and to my petition, O Lord God, so as to hearken to the petition and the prayer which thy servant prays before thee this day:   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>so that thine eyes should be open over this house by day and by night, toward this place, whereon thou saidst thy name should be called, so as to hear the prayer which thy servant prays toward this house.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt hear the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, whatsoever prayers they shall make toward this place: and thou shalt hearken in thy dwelling place out of heaven, yea thou shalt hear, and be merciful.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>If a man sin against his neighbor, and he bring an oath upon him so as to make him swear, and he come and swear before the altar in this house;

  <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>then shalt thou hearken out of heaven and shalt be merciful to the sins of thy people Israel, and thou shalt restore them to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>When heaven is restrained, and there is no rain, because they shall have sinned against thee, and <span class='add'>when</span> they shall pray toward this place, and praise thy name, and shall turn from their sins, because thou shalt afflict them;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>then shalt thou hearken from heaven, and thou shalt be merciful to the sins of thy servants, and of thy people Israel; for thou shalt show them the good way in which they shall walk;

  <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>then shalt thou hear from heaven, out of thy prepared dwelling place, and shalt be merciful, and shalt recompense to the man according to his ways, as thou shalt know his heart <span class='add'>to be</span>; for thou alone knowest the heart of the children of men:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>that they may reverence all thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land, which thou gavest to our fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And every stranger who is not himself of thy people Israel, and who shall have come from a distant land because of thy great name, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm;
