This is the caldron, and we are the flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, say;  </div><div class='p'>Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: and I know the devices of your spirit.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Ye have multiplied your dead in this city, and ye have filled your ways with slain men.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord; Your dead whom ye have smitten in the midst of it, these are the flesh, and this<span class='add'>city</span> is the caldron: but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Ye fear the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And I will bring you forth out of the midst of it, and will deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you on the mountains of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And it came to pass, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died.
