So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Ahaziah began to reign when he was twenty years old, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do evil.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord as the house of Ahab <span class='add'>had done</span>: for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he walked in their counsels, and he went with Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria to Ramoth-gilead: and the archers smote Joram.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Joram returned to Jezreel to be healed of the wounds wherewith the Syrians smote him in Ramoth, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria.  </div><div class='p'>And Ahaziah son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab at Jezreel because he was sick.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And destruction from God came upon Ahaziah in <span class='add'>his</span> coming to Joram; for when he had come, Jehoram went out with him against Jehu the son of Nimshi, the anointed of the Lord against the house of Ahab.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Jehu was taking vengeance on the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah and the brethren of Ahaziah ministering to Ahaziah, and he slew them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he gave orders to seek Ahaziah: and they took him while he was healing his wounds in Samaria, and they brought him to Jehu, and he slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart.  </div><div class='p'>So there was none in the house of Ahaziah to secure their power in the kingdom.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, and she arose and destroyed all the seed royal in the house of Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and rescued him secretly out of the midst of the sons of the king that were put to death, and she placed him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath daughter of King Jehoram, sister of Ahaziah, wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid him, and she <span class='add'>even</span> hid him from Athaliah, and she did not slay him.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he was with him hidden in the house of God six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
