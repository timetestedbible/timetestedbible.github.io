<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 27</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Many have sinned for a small matter;  </div><div class='q'>And he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones;  </div><div class='q'>So doth sin stick close between buying and selling.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>His house shall soon be overthrown.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth;  </div><div class='q'>So the filth of man in his talk.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The furnace proveth the potter’s vessels;  </div><div class='q'>So the trial of man is in his reasoning.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed;  </div><div class='q'>So is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Praise no man before thou hearest him speak;  </div><div class='q'>For this is the trial of men.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her,  </div><div class='q'>And put her on, as a glorious long robe.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The birds will resort unto their like;  </div><div class='q'>So will truth return unto them that practice in her.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As the lion lieth in wait for the prey;  </div><div class='q'>So sin for them that work iniquity.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom;  </div><div class='q'>But a fool changeth as the moon.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time;  </div><div class='q'>But be continually among men of understanding.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The discourse of fools is irksome,  </div><div class='q'>And their sport is the wantonness of sin.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright;  </div><div class='q'>And their brawls make one stop his ears.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>The strife of the proud is bloodshedding,  </div><div class='q'>And their revilings are grievous to the ear.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit;  </div><div class='q'>And shall never find friend to his mind.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him:  </div><div class='q'>But if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For as a man hath destroyed his enemy;  </div><div class='q'>So hast thou lost the love of thy neighbor.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand,  </div><div class='q'>So hast thou let thy neighbor go, and shalt not get him again.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Follow after him no more, for he is too far off;  </div><div class='q'>He is as a roe escaped out of the snare.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>As for a wound, it may be bound up;  </div><div class='q'>And after reviling there may be reconcilement:  </div><div class='q'>But he that betrayeth secrets is without hope.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil:  </div><div class='q'>And he that knoweth him will depart from him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>When thou art present, he will speak sweetly,  </div><div class='q'>And will admire thy words:  </div><div class='q'>But at the last he will writhe his mouth,  </div><div class='q'>And slander thy sayings.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I have hated many things, but nothing like him;  </div><div class='q'>For the Lord will hate him.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Whoso casteth a stone on high casteth it on his own head;  </div><div class='q'>And a deceitful stroke shall make wounds.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein:  </div><div class='q'>And he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>He that worketh mischief, it shall fall upon him,  </div><div class='q'>And he shall not know whence it cometh.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Mockery and reproach are from the proud;  </div><div class='q'>But vengeance, as a lion, shall lie in wait for him.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>They that rejoice at the fall of the righteous shall be taken in the snare;  </div><div class='q'>And anguish shall consume them before they die.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Malice and wrath, even these are abominations;  </div><div class='q'>And the sinful man shall have them both.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
