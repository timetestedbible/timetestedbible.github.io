This is that which the Lord has appointed: gather of it each man for his family, an omer for each person, according to the number of your souls, gather each of you with his fellow lodgers.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some much and some less.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And having measured the omer <span class='add'>full</span>, he that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered less had no lack; each gathered according to the need of those who belonged to him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But they did not hearken to Moses, but some left of it till the morning; and it bred worms and stank: and Moses was irritated with them.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And they gathered it every morning, each man what he needed, and when the sun waxed hot it melted.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the sixth day, they gathered double what was needed, two omers for one <span class='add'>man</span>; and all the chiefs of the synagogue went in and reported it to Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Moses said to them, Is not this the word which the Lord spoke? Tomorrow <span class='add'>is</span> the Sabbath, a holy rest to the Lord: bake that ye will bake, and seethe that ye will seethe, and all that is over leave to be laid by for the morrow.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they left of it till the morning, as Moses commanded them; and it stank not, neither was there a worm in it.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Moses said, Eat <span class='add'>that</span> today, for today is a Sabbath to the Lord: <span class='add'>it</span> shall not be found in the plain.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Six days ye shall gather it, and on the seventh day is a Sabbath, for there shall be none on that <span class='add'>day</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the seventh day <span class='add'>that</span> some of the people went forth to gather, and found none.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, How long are ye unwilling to hearken to my commands and my law?   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>See, for the Lord has given you this day <span class='add'>as</span> the Sabbath, therefore he has given you on the sixth day the bread of two days: ye shall sit each of you in your houses; let no one go forth from his place on the seventh day.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the people kept Sabbath on the seventh day.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the children of Israel called the name of it Manna; and it was as white coriander seed, and the taste of it as a wafer with honey.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Moses said, This <span class='add'>is</span> the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Fill an omer with manna, to be laid up for your generations; that they may see the bread which ye ate in the wilderness, when the Lord led you forth out of the land of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a golden pot, and cast into it one full omer of manna; and thou shalt lay it up before God, to be kept for your generations,   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>as the Lord commanded Moses: and Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to the land they ate the manna, until they came to the region of Phoenicia.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Now the omer was the tenth part of three measures.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
