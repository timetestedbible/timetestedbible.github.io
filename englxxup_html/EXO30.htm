and the height of it shall be of two cubits, its horns shall be of the same piece.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And thou shalt gild its grate with pure gold, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou shalt make for it a wreathen border of gold roundabout.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And thou shalt make under its wreathen border two rings of pure gold; thou shalt make it to the two corners on the two sides, and they shall be bearings for the staffs, so as to bear it with them.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And thou shalt make the staffs of incorruptible wood, and shalt gild them with gold.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou shalt set it before the veil that is over the ark of the testimonies, wherein I will make myself known to thee from thence.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Aaron shall burn upon it fine compound incense every morning;
