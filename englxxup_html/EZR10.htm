<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 10</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>So when Ezra <span class='add'>had</span> prayed, and when he <span class='add'>had</span> confessed, weeping and praying before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel came together to him, men and women and youths; for the people wept, and wept aloud.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have broken covenant with our God, and have taken strange wives of the nations of the land: yet now there is patience <span class='add'>of hope</span> to Israel concerning this thing.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now then let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and their offspring, as thou shalt advise:   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>arise, and alarm them with the commands of our God; and let <span class='add'>it</span> be done according to the law. Rise up, for the matter <span class='add'>is</span> upon thee; and we <span class='add'>are</span> with thee: be strong and do.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then Ezra arose, and caused the rulers, the priests, and Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word: and they swore.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went to the treasury of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; he even went thither: he ate no bread, and drank no water; for he mourned over the unfaithfulness <span class='add'>of them</span> of the captivity.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should assemble at Jerusalem, <span class='add'>saying</span>,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Every one who shall not arrive within three days, as <span class='add'>is</span> the counsel of the rulers and the elders, all his substance shall be forfeited, and he shall be separated from the congregation of the captivity.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days. This <span class='add'>was</span> the ninth month: on the twentieth day of the month all the people sat down in the street of the house of the Lord, because of their alarm concerning the word, and because of the storm.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Ezra the priest arose, and said to them, Ye have broken covenant, and have taken strange wives, to add to the trespass of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Now therefore give praise to the Lord God of our fathers, and do that which is pleasing in his sight: and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the strange wives.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then all the congregation answered and said, This thy word <span class='add'>is</span> powerful upon us to do it.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But the people <span class='add'>is</span> numerous, and the season <span class='add'>is</span> stormy, and there is no power to stand without, and the work is more than enough for one day or for two; for we have greatly sinned in this matter.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let now our rulers stand, and for all those in our cities who have taken strange wives, let them come at appointed times, and with them elders from every several city, and judges, to turn away the fierce wrath of our God from us concerning this matter.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Only Jonathan the son of Asahel, and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah <span class='add'>were</span> with me concerning this; and Meshullam, and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the children of the captivity did thus: and Ezra the priest, and heads of families according to <span class='add'>their</span> house were separated, and all by their names, for they returned in the first day of the tenth month to search out the matter.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they made an end with all the men who had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And there were found <span class='add'>some</span> of the sons of the priests who had taken strange wives: of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And they pledged themselves to put away their wives, and <span class='add'>offered</span> a ram of the flock for a trespass offering because of their trespass.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And of the sons of Immer;
