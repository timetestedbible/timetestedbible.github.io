</div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>She weeps sore in the night,  </div><div class='q'>And her tears are on her cheeks;  </div><div class='q'>And there is none of all her lovers to comfort her:  </div><div class='q'>All that were her friends have dealt deceitfully with her,  </div><div class='q'>They are become her enemies.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction,  </div><div class='q'>And by reason of the abundance of her servitude:  </div><div class='q'>She dwells among the nations,  </div><div class='q'>She has not found rest:  </div><div class='q'>All her pursuers have overtaken her between her oppressors.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The ways of Zion mourn,  </div><div class='q'>Because there are none that come to the feast:  </div><div class='q'>All her gates are ruined:  </div><div class='q'>Her priests groan,  </div><div class='q'>Her virgins are led captive,  </div><div class='q'>And she is in bitterness in herself.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Her oppressors are become the head,  </div><div class='q'>And her enemies have prospered;  </div><div class='q'>For the Lord has afflicted her  </div><div class='q'>Because of the multitude of her sins:  </div><div class='q'>Her young children are gone into captivity  </div><div class='q'>Before the face of the oppressor.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And all her beauty has been taken away  </div><div class='q'>From the daughter of Zion:  </div><div class='q'>Her princes were as rams finding no pasture,  </div><div class='q'>And are gone <span class='add'>away</span> in weakness  </div><div class='q'>Before the face of the pursuer.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction,  </div><div class='q'>And her rejection;  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>She thought on</span> all her desirable things  </div><div class='q'>Which were from the days of old,  </div><div class='q'>When her people fell into the hands of the oppressor,  </div><div class='q'>And there was none to help her:  </div><div class='q'>When her enemies saw <span class='add'>it</span>  </div><div class='q'>They laughed at her habitation.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Jerusalem has sinned a <span class='add'>great</span> sin;  </div><div class='q'>Therefore has she come into tribulation,  </div><div class='q'>All that used to honor her have afflicted her,  </div><div class='q'>For they have seen her shame:  </div><div class='q'>Yea, she herself groaned, and turned backward.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Her uncleanness is before her feet;  </div><div class='q'>She remembered not her last end;  </div><div class='q'>She has lowered her boasting <span class='add'>tone</span>,  </div><div class='q'>There is none to comfort her.  </div><div class='q'>Behold, O Lord, my affliction:  </div><div class='q'>For the enemy has magnified himself.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The oppressor has stretched out his hand  </div><div class='q'>On all her desirable things:  </div><div class='q'>For she has seen the Gentiles  </div><div class='q'>Entering into her sanctuary,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Concerning</span> whom thou didst command  </div><div class='q'>That they should not enter into thy congregation.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;
