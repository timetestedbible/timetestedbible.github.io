So he removed, and came to Beth-shan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand men chosen for the battle, and came to Beth-shan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Now when Trypho saw that Jonathan came with so great a force, he durst not stretch his hand against him;   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>but received him honorably, and commended him unto all his friends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to be as obedient unto him, as to himself.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou put all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no war between us?   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men to wait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will give it thee, and the rest of the strongholds and forces, and all that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart: for this is the cause of my coming.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Judea.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whom he sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went with him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and took him, and all them that came with him they slew with the sword.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Then sent Trypho a host of footmen and horsemen into Galilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan’s company.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with him were taken and slain, they encouraged one another, and went close together, prepared to fight.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that they were ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, and there they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, and they were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made great lamentation.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Then all the heathen that were round about them sought to destroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any to help them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and take away their memorial from among men.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
