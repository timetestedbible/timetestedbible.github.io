And David sent to comfort him concerning his father by the hand of his servants; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, <span class='add'>Is it</span> to honor thy father before thee that David has sent comforters to thee? Has not David rather sent his servants to thee that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Hanun took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And they brought David word concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly dishonored: and the king said, Remain in Jericho till your beards have grown, and <span class='add'>then</span> ye shall return.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, and Rehob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalek with a thousand men, and Tob with twelve thousand men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And David heard, and sent Joab and all his host, <span class='add'>even</span> the mighty men.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate: <span class='add'>those</span> of Syria, Zobah, and Rehob, and Tob, and Amalek, being by themselves in the field.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out <span class='add'>some</span> of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he said, If Syria be too strong for me, then shall ye help me: and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then will we be ready to help thee.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Be thou courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God, and the Lord shall do that which is good in his eyes.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Joab and his people with him advanced to battle against Syria, and they fled from before him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abishai, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Hadadezer sent and gathered the Syrians from the other side of the river Chalamak, and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadadezer <span class='add'>was</span> at their head.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it was reported to David, and he gathered all Israel, and went over Jordan, and came to Helam: and the Syrians set the battle in array against David, and fought with him.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Syria fled from before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and he smote Shobach the captain of his host, and he died there.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And all the kings the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, and they went over to Israel, and served them: and Syria was afraid to help the children of Ammon anymore.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
