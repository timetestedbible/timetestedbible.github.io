<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 7</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the <span class='add'>son</span> of Seleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto a city of the sea coast, and reigned there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bring them unto him.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see their faces.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon the throne of his kingdom,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>there came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel, having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for their captain:   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas and his brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out of our own land.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him go and see what havoc he hath made among us, and in the king’s land, and let him punish them with all them that aid them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the river, and was a great man in the kingdom, and faithful to the king.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made high priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Judah, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that they were come with great power.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a company of scribes, to require justice.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Now the Hasideans were the first among the children of Israel that sought peace of them:   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>for said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron is come with this army, and he will do us no wrong.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>So he spoke unto them peaceably, and swore unto them, saying, We will procure the harm neither of you nor your friends.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of them threescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the words which he wrote,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The flesh of thy saints <span class='add'>have they cast out</span>, and their blood have they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to bury them.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all the people, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness in them; for they have broken the covenant and oath that they made.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>After this removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Beth-zaith, where he sent and took many of the men that had forsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he had slain them, <span class='add'>he cast them</span> into the great pit.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who, after they had gotten the land of Judah into their power, did much hurt in Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>he went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, and took vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that they durst no more go forth into the country.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and his company had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went again to the king, and said evil things against them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honorable princes, a man that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment to destroy the people.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force: and sent unto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with a few men, that I may see you in peace.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judas by violence.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Which thing after it was known to Judas, <span class='add'>to wit</span>, that he came unto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered, went out to fight against Judas beside Caphar-salama:   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>and there were slain of Nicanor’s side about five thousand men, and <span class='add'>the rest</span> fled into the city of David.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>After this went Nicanor up to Mount Zion, and there came out of the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of the elders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to show him the burnt sacrifice that was offered for the king.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spoke proudly,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>and swore in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host be now delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, I will burn up this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar and the temple, weeping, and saying,   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thy name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by the sword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents in Beth-horon, where a host out of Syria met him.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out and smote a hundred fourscore and five thousand of them.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy sanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joined battle: but Nicanor’s host was discomfited, and he himself was first slain in the battle.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Now when Nicanor’s host saw that he was slain, they cast away their weapons, and fled.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Then they pursued after them a day’s journey, from Adasa unto Gazara, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea round about, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon them that pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one of them was left.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Afterward they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote off Nicanor’s head, and his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up toward Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and kept that day <span class='add'>as</span> a day of great gladness.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being the thirteenth of Adar.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Thus the land of Judah was in rest a little while.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
