But ye said, What does God seek but a seed? But take ye heed to your spirit, and forsake not the wife of thy youth.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if thou shouldest hate <span class='add'>thy wife</span> and put her away, saith the Lord God of Israel, then ungodliness shall cover thy thoughts, saith the Lord Almighty: therefore take ye heed to your spirit, and forsake <span class='add'>them</span> not,   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>ye that have provoked God with your words. But ye said, Wherein have we provoked him? In that ye say, Every one that does evil is a pleasing <span class='add'>object</span> in the sight of the Lord, and he takes pleasure in such; and where is the God of justice?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
