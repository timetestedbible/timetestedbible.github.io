And he said, I will go up: thou art as I, I am as thou; as my people, so <span class='add'>is</span> thy people, as my horses, so <span class='add'>are</span> thy horses.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said, What way shall I go up? and he said, The way of the wilderness of Edom.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days’ journey; and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that went with them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the Lord should have called the three kings on their way, to give them into the hand of Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire of the Lord by him? And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, <span class='add'>There is</span> here Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Jehoshaphat said, He has the word of the Lord. And the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and the king of Edom, went down to him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Has the Lord called the three kings to deliver them into the hands of Moab?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Elisha said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord of hosts before whom I stand lives, unless I regarded the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not have looked on thee, nor seen thee.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And now fetch me a harper. And it came to pass, as the harper harped, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, Thus saith the Lord, Make this valley full of trenches.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain, yet this valley shall be filled with water, and ye, and your flocks, and your cattle shall drink.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>is</span> a light <span class='add'>thing</span> in the eyes of the Lord: I will also deliver Moab into your hand.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And ye shall smite every strong city, and ye shall cut down every good tree, and ye shall stop all wells of water, and spoil every good piece <span class='add'>of land</span> with stones.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the morning, when the sacrifice was offered, that, behold! waters came from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And all Moab heard that the three kings were come up to fight against them; and they cried out on every <span class='add'>side, even</span> all that were girded with a girdle, and they said, Ho! and stood upon the border.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose upon the waters, and Moab saw the waters on the opposite side red as blood.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And they said, This <span class='add'>is</span> the blood of the sword; and the kings have fought, and each man has smitten his neighbor; now then to the spoils, Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And they entered into the camp of Israel; and Israel arose and smote Moab, and they fled from before them; and they went on and smote Moab as they went.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And they razed the cities, and cast every man his stone on every good piece <span class='add'>of land</span> and filled it; and they stopped every well, and cut down every good tree, until they left <span class='add'>only</span> the stones of the wall cast down; and the slingers compassed <span class='add'>the land</span>, and smote it.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed against him; and he took with him seven hundred men that drew sword, to cut through to the king of Edom: and they could not.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he took his eldest son whom he had designed to reign in his stead, and offered him up for a whole burnt offering on the walls. And there was a great indignation against Israel; and they departed from him, and returned to their land.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
