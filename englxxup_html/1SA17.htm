Am not I a Philistine, and ye Hebrews of Saul? choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And if he shall be able to fight against me, and shall smite me, then will we be your servants: but if I should prevail and smite him, ye shall be our servants, and serve us.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Philistine said, Behold, I have defied the armies of Israel this very day: give me a man, and we will both of us fight in single combat.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, and they were dismayed, and greatly terrified.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And David said to Saul, Let not, I pray thee, the heart of my lord be dejected within him: thy servant will go, and fight with this Philistine.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And Saul said to David, Thou wilt not in anywise be able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou art a mere youth, and he a man of war from his youth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And David said to Saul, Thy servant was tending the flock for his father; and when a lion came and a she-bear, and took a sheep out of the flock,   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>then I went forth after him, and smote him, and drew <span class='add'>the spoil</span> out of his mouth: and as he rose up against me, then I caught hold of his throat, and smote him, and slew him.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Thy servant smote both the lion and the bear, and the uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them: shall I not go and smite him, and remove this day a reproach from Israel? for who <span class='add'>is</span> this uncircumcised one, who has defied the army of the living God?   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The Lord who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this uncircumcised Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the Lord shall be with thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Saul clothed David with a military coat, and <span class='add'>put</span> his brazen helmet on his head.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>And he girded David with his sword over his coat: and he made trial walking <span class='add'>with them</span> once and again: and David said to Saul, I shall not be able to go with these, for I have not proved <span class='add'>them</span>: so they remove them from him.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he took his staff in his hand, and he chose for himself five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd’s scrip which he had for his store, and his sling was in his hand; and he approached the Philistine.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Goliath saw David, and despised him; for he was a lad, and ruddy, with a fair countenance.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And the Philistine said to David, Am I as a dog, that thou comest against me with a staff and stones? and David said, Nay, but worse than a dog. And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh to the birds of the air, and to the beasts of the earth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with sword, and with spear, and with shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord God of hosts of the army of Israel, which thou hast defied   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>this day. And the Lord shall deliver thee this day into my hand; and I will slay thee, and take away thy head from off thee, and will give thy limbs and the limbs of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth; and all the earth shall know that there is a God in Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And all this assembly shall know that the Lord delivers not by sword or spear, for the battle <span class='add'>is</span> the Lord’s, and the Lord will deliver you into our hands.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And the Philistine arose and went to meet David.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And David stretched out his hand to his scrip, and took thence a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine on his forehead, and the stone penetrated through the helmet into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And David ran, and stood upon him, and took his sword, and slew him, and cut off his head: and the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, and they fled.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the men of Israel and Judah arose, and shouted and pursued them as far as the entrance to Gath, and as far as the gate of Ashkelon: and the slain men of the Philistines fell in the way of the gates, both to Gath, and to Ekron.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And the men of Israel returned from pursuing after the Philistines, and they destroyed their camp.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
