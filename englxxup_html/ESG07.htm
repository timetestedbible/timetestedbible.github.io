Then Haman was troubled before the king and the queen.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king rose up from the banquet to go into the garden: and Haman began to entreat the queen; for he saw that he was in an evil case.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king returned from the garden; and Haman had fallen upon the bed, entreating the queen. And the king said, Wilt thou even force <span class='add'>my</span> wife in my house? And when Haman heard it, he changed countenance.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Bugathan, one of the chamberlains, said to the king, Behold, Haman has also prepared a gallows for Mordecai, who spoke concerning the king, and a gallows of fifty cubits high has been set up in the premises of Haman. And the king said, Let him be hanged thereon.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai: and then the king’s wrath was appeased.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
