And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the pattern of the altar, and its proportions, and all its workmanship.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Uriah the priest built the altar, according to all <span class='add'>the directions</span> which King Ahaz sent from Damascus.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the king saw the altar, and went up to it,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>and offered his whole burnt offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering, and poured out the blood of his peace offerings on the brazen altar that was before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he brought forward <span class='add'>the one</span> before the house of the Lord from between the altar and the house of the Lord, and he set it openly by the side of the altar northward.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And King Ahaz charged Uriah the priest, saying, Offer upon the great altar the whole burnt offering in the morning and the meat offering in the evening, and the whole burnt offering of the king, and his meat offering, and the whole burnt offering of all the people, and their meat offering, and their drink offering; and thou shalt pour all the blood of the whole burnt offering, and all the blood of <span class='add'>any other</span> sacrifice upon it: and the brazen altar shall be for me in the morning.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Uriah the priest did according to all that King Ahaz commanded him.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them, and took down the sea from the brazen oxen that were under it, and set it upon a base of stone.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he made a base for the throne in the house of the Lord, and he turned the king’s entrance without in the house of the Lord because of the king of the Assyrians.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the rest of the acts of Ahaz, even all that he did, <span class='add'>are</span> not these written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
