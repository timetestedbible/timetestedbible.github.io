I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he said to me, <span class='add'>It is</span> a great thing for thee to be called my servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob, and to recover the dispersion of Israel: behold, I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship him, for the Lord’s sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have chosen thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succored thee: and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of the nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert heritages:   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth; and <span class='add'>bidding</span> them that are in darkness show themselves.
