  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Have the gods of the nations at all delivered them, whom my fathers destroyed; both Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad? and where is the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it: and he went up to the house of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it before the Lord,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and said, O Lord God of Israel, that dwellest over the cherubs, thou art the only God in all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Incline thine ear, O Lord, and hear: open, Lord, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to reproach the living God.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have wasted the nations,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and have cast their gods into the fire: because they are no gods, but the works of men’s hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And now, O Lord our God, deliver us out of his hand, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall know that thou alone <span class='add'>art</span> the Lord God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherib king of the Assyrians.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>This <span class='add'>is</span> the word which the Lord has spoken against him; The virgin daughter of Zion has made light of thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou reviled? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice, and raised thine eyes on high? <span class='add'>Is it</span> against the Holy One of Israel?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, I will go up with the multitude of my chariots, to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and I have cut down the height of his cedar, <span class='add'>and</span> his choice cypresses; and I have come into the midst of the forest and of Carmel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>I have refreshed <span class='add'>myself</span>, and have drunk strange waters, and I have dried up with the sole of my foot all the rivers of fortified places.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>I have brought about <span class='add'>the matter</span>, I have brought it to a conclusion; and it is come to the destruction of the bands of warlike prisoners, <span class='add'>even of</span> strong cities.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they that dwelt in them were weak in hand, they quaked and were confounded, they became <span class='add'>as</span> grass of the field, or <span class='add'>as</span> the green herb, the grass <span class='add'>growing on</span> houses, and that which is trodden down by him that stands <span class='add'>upon it</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>But I know thy downsitting, and thy going forth, and thy rage against me.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Because thou wast angry against me, and thy fierceness is come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hooks in thy nostrils, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And this shall be a sign to thee; eat this year the things that grow of themselves, and in the second year the things which spring up: and in the third year <span class='add'>let there be</span> sowing, and reaping, and planting of vineyards, and eat ye the fruit of them.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he shall increase him that has escaped of the house of Judah: and the remnant <span class='add'>shall strike</span> root beneath, and it shall produce fruit above.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For from Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and he that escapes from the mountain of Zion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span><span class='add'>Is it</span> not so?
