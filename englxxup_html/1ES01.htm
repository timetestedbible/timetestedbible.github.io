it was not lawful for any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord accomplished in that day, that they might hold the Passover,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>and offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord, according to the commandment of King Josiah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>So the children of Israel which were present held the Passover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And such a Passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the prophet Samuel.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a Passover as Josiah, and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israel that were found dwelling at Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the works of Josiah were upright before his Lord with a heart full of godliness.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were written in former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly against the Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly, so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Now after all these acts of Josiah it came to pass that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchemish upon Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my war is upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea the Lord is with me hastening me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Howbeit Josiah did not turn back his chariot from him, but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremiah spoken by the mouth of the Lord:   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>but joined battle with him in the plain of Megiddo, and the princes came against King Josiah.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out of the battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servants took him away out of the battle.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Then got he up upon his second chariot; and being brought back to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father’s sepulcher.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And in all Jewry they mourned for Josiah, yea, Jeremiah the prophet lamented for Josiah, and the chief men with the women made lamentation for him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinance to be done continually in all the nation of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josiah did, and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord; and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited, are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the people took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made <span class='add'>him</span> king instead of Josiah his father when he was twenty and three years old.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: and then the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And he set a tax upon the land of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The king of Egypt also made King Jehoiakim his brother king of Judea and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And he bound Jehoiakim and the nobles: but Zarius his brother he apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Five and twenty years old was Jehoiakim when he was made king in the land of Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>Wherefore against him Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came up, and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Nebuchadnezzar also took of the holy vessels of the Lord, and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleanness and impiety, are written in the chronicles of the kings.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Jehoiakim his son reigned in his stead: he was made king being eighteen years old;   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>and reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and did evil before the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>So after a year Nebuchadnezzar sent and caused him to be brought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And made Zedekiah king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he was one and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:   <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>and he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared not for the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremiah from the mouth of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And after that King Nebuchadnezzar had made him to swear by the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled; and hardening his neck, and his heart, he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things against the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations, and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>But they had his messengers in derision; and, in the day that the Lord spoke unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:   <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>so far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness, commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them;   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compass of their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid, old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.   <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king’s treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>As for the house of the Lord, they burned it, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>and as for her glorious things, they never ceased till they had consumed and brought them all to nought; and the people that were not slain with the sword he carried into Babylon:   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned, to fulfill the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah:   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>until the land had enjoyed her Sabbaths, the whole time of her desolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
