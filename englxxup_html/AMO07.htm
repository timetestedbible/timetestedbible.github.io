And this shall not be, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Thus has the Lord shown me; and, behold, the Lord called for judgment by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and devoured the Lord’s portion.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I said, O Lord, cease, I pray thee: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small in number. Repent, O Lord, for this.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>This also shall not be, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thus the Lord showed me; and behold, he stood upon a wall of adamant, and in his hand <span class='add'>was</span> an adamant.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, What seest thou, Amos? And I said, An adamant. And the Lord said to me, Behold, I appoint an adamant in the midst of my people Israel: I will not pass by them anymore.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And the joyful altars shall be abolished, and the sacrifices of Israel shall be set aside; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos is forming conspiracies against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will be utterly unable to bear all his words.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For thus says Amos, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be led away captive from his land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Amaziah said to Amos, Go, seer, remove thou into the land of Judah, and live there, and thou shalt prophesy there:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>but thou shalt no longer prophesy at Bethel: for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the royal house.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And Amos answered, and said to Amaziah, I was not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet; but I was a herdsman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruits.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the Lord took me from the sheep, and the Lord said to me, Go, and prophesy to my people Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And now hear the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, Prophesy not to Israel, and raise not a tumult against the house of Jacob.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Lord; Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured with the line; and thou shalt die in an unclean land; and Israel shall be led captive out of his land.
