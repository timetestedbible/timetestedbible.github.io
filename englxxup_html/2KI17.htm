And they made for themselves pillars and groves on every high hill, and under every shady tree.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And burned incense there on all high places, as the nations <span class='add'>did</span> whom the Lord removed from before them, and dealt with familiar spirits, and they carved <span class='add'>images</span> to provoke the Lord to anger.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they served the idols, of which the Lord said to them, Ye shall not do this thing <span class='add'>against</span> the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord testified against Israel and against Judah, even by the hand of all his prophets, <span class='add'>and</span> of every seer, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my ordinances, and all the law which I commanded your fathers, <span class='add'>and</span> all that I sent to them by the hand of my servants the prophets.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But they hearkened not, and made their neck harder than the neck of their fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And they kept not any of his testimonies which he charged them; and they walked after vanities, and became vain, and after the nations round about them, concerning which the Lord had charged them not to do accordingly.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>They forsook the commandments of the Lord their God, and made themselves graven images, <span class='add'>even</span> two heifers, and they made groves, and worshiped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divinations and auspices, and sold themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight; and there was only left the tribe of Judah quite alone.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Nay even Judah kept not the commandments of the Lord their God, but they walked according to the customs of Israel which they practiced, and rejected the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord was angry with the whole seed of Israel, and troubled them, and gave them into the hand of them that spoiled them, until he cast them out of his presence.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Forasmuch as Israel revolted from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drew off Israel from following the Lord, and led them to sin a great sin.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the children of Israel walked in all the sin of Jeroboam which he committed; they departed not from it,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, as the Lord spoke by all his servants the prophets; and Israel was removed from off their land to the Assyrians until this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the king of Assyria brought from Babylon the men of Cuthah, <span class='add'>and men</span> from Avva, and from Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and they were settled in the cities of Samaria in the place of the children of Israel: and they inherited Samaria, and were settled in its cities.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And it was so at the beginning of their establishment there <span class='add'>that</span> they feared not the Lord, and the Lord sent lions among them, and they slew some of them.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And they spoke to the king of the Assyrians, saying, The nations whom thou hast removed and substituted in the cities of Samaria <span class='add'>for the Israelites</span>, know not the manner of the God of the land: and he has sent the lions against them, and, behold, they are slaying them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And the king of the Assyrians commanded, saying, Bring some <span class='add'>Israelites</span> thence, and let them go and dwell there, and they shall teach them the manner of the God of the land.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they brought one of the priests whom they had removed from Samaria, and he settled in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>But the nations made each their own gods, and put them in the house of the high places which the Samaritans <span class='add'>had</span> made, each nation in the cities in which they dwelt.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the <span class='add'>inhabitant</span> of Sepharvaim <span class='add'>did evil</span> when they burned their sons in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And they feared the Lord, yet they established their abominations in the houses of the high places which they made in Samaria, each nation in the city in which they dwelt: and they feared the Lord, and they made for themselves priests of the high places, and sacrificed for themselves in the house of the high places.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And they feared the Lord, and served their gods according to the manner of the nations, whence <span class='add'>their lords</span> brought them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Until this day they did according to their manner: they fear <span class='add'>the Lord</span>, and they do according to their customs, and according to their manner, and according to the law, and according to the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob, whose name he made Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And the Lord made a covenant with them, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, neither shall ye worship them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>but only to the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great strength and with a high arm: him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship;
