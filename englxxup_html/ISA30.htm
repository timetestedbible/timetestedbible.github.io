</div> <div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The vision of the quadrupeds in the desert.  </div><div class='p'>In affliction and distress, <span class='add'>where are</span> the lion and lion’s whelp, thence <span class='add'>come</span> also asps, and the young of flying asps, <span class='add'>there shall they be</span> who bore their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which shall not profit them.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for <span class='add'>many long</span> days, and even forever.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak <span class='add'>them</span> not to us, but speak and report to us another error;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this respect:   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel, <span class='add'>as</span> small fragments of a pitcher, so that thou shouldest not find among them a sherd, with which thou mightest take up fire, and with which thou shouldest draw a little water.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities: <span class='add'>then</span> your strength became vain, yet ye would not hearken:   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>but ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye be left as a signal post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay themselves upon him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the holy people shall dwell in Zion: and <span class='add'>whereas</span> Jerusalem has wept bitterly, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Pity me; he shall pity thee: when he perceived the voice of thy cry, he hearkened to thee.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>though</span> the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that cause thee to err shall no more at all draw nigh to thee; for thine eyes shall see those that cause thee to err,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and thine ears shall hear the words of them that went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This <span class='add'>is</span> the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou shalt grind to powder the gilded ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a removed <span class='add'>woman</span>, and thou shalt thrust them forth as dung.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land; and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a <span class='add'>long</span> time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for <span class='add'>their</span> vain error: error also shall pursue them, and overtake them.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Must ye always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and <span class='add'>his wrath shall be</span> as water and violent hail.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, <span class='add'>even</span> by the stroke wherewith he shall smite them.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it shall happen to him from every side, <span class='add'>that</span> they from whom their hope of assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn with drums and with harp.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>For thou shalt be required before <span class='add'>thy</span> time: has it been prepared for thee also to reign? nay, God has <span class='add'>prepared for thee</span> a deep trench, wood piled, fire and much wood: the wrath of the Lord <span class='add'>shall be</span> as a trench kindled with sulphur.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
