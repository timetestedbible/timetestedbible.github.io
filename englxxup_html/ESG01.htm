</div><div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 1</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span><span class='sc'>In</span> the second year of the reign of Artaxerxes the great king, on the first <span class='add'>day</span> of Nisan, Mordecai the <span class='add'>son</span> of Jair, the <span class='add'>son</span> of Shimei, the <span class='add'>son</span> of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin,   <span class="verse" id="V2">1b&#160;</span>a Jew dwelling in the city Susa, a great man, serving in the king’s palace, saw a vision.   <span class="verse" id="V3">1c&#160;</span>Now he was of the captivity which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried captive from Jerusalem, with Jechoniah the king of Judea.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">1d&#160;</span>And this <span class='add'>was</span> his dream: Behold, voices and a noise, thunders and earthquake, tumult upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V5">1e&#160;</span>And, behold, two great serpents came forth, both ready for conflict, and there came from them a great voice,   <span class="verse" id="V6">1f&#160;</span>and by their voice every nation was prepared for battle, even to fight against the nation of the just.   <span class="verse" id="V7">1g&#160;</span>And, behold, a day of darkness and blackness, tribulation and anguish, affliction and great tumult upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V8">1h&#160;</span>And all the righteous nation was troubled, fearing their own afflictions; and they prepared to die, and cried to God:   <span class="verse" id="V9">1i&#160;</span>and from their cry there came as it were a great river from a little fountain, <span class='add'>even</span> much water.   <span class="verse" id="V10">1k&#160;</span>And light and the sun arose, and the lowly were exalted, and devoured the honorable.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">1l&#160;</span>And Mordecai who had seen this vision and what God designed to do, having awoke, kept it in his heart, and desired by all means to interpret it, even till night.   <span class="verse" id="V12">1m&#160;</span>And Mordecai rested quiet in the palace with Gabatha and Tharra the king’s two chamberlains, eunuchs who guarded the palace.   <span class="verse" id="V13">1n&#160;</span>And he heard their reasonings and searched out their plans, and learned that they were preparing to lay hands on King Artaxerxes: and he informed the king concerning them.   <span class="verse" id="V14">1o&#160;</span>And the king examined the two chamberlains, and they confessed, and were executed.   <span class="verse" id="V15">1p&#160;</span>And the king wrote these things for a memorial; also Mordecai wrote concerning these matters.   <span class="verse" id="V16">1q&#160;</span>And the king commanded Mordecai to attend in the palace, and gave him gifts for this service.   <span class="verse" id="V17">1r&#160;</span>And Haman the son of Hammedatha the Bougean was honorable in the sight of the king, and he endeavored to hurt Mordecai and his people, because of the two chamberlains of the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">1s&#160;</span>And it came to pass after these things in the days of Artaxerxes (this Artaxerxes ruled over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces from India)—   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>in those days, when King Artaxerxes was on the throne in the city of Susa,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>in the third year of his reign, he made a feast to his friends, and the other nations, and to the nobles of the Persians and Medes, and the chief of the satraps.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And after this, after he had shown to them the wealth of his kingdom, and the abundant glory of his wealth during a hundred and eighty days,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>when, <span class='add'>I say</span>, the days of the marriage feast were completed, the king made a banquet to the nations who were present in the city six days, in the court of the king’s house,   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span><span class='add'>which was</span> adorned with <span class='add'>hangings</span> of fine linen and flax on cords of fine linen and purple, fastened to golden and silver studs, on pillars of parian marble and stone: <span class='add'>there were</span> golden and silver couches on a pavement of emerald stone, and of pearl, and of parian stone, and open-worked coverings variously flowered, <span class='add'>having</span> roses worked round about;   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>gold and silver cups, and a small cup of carbuncle set out of the value of thirty thousand talents, abundant and sweet wine, which the king himself drank.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And this banquet was not according to the appointed law; but so the king would have it: and he charged the stewards to perform his will and that of the company.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Also Vashti the queen made a banquet for the women in the palace where King Artaxerxes <span class='add'>dwelt</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Now on the seventh day the king, being merry, told Haman, and Bazan, and Tharra, and Boraze, and Zatholtha, and Abataza, and Tharaba, the seven chamberlains, servants of King Artaxerxes,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>to bring in the queen to him, to enthrone her, and crown her with the diadem, and to show her to the princes, and her beauty to the nations: for she was beautiful.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But queen Vashti hearkened not to him to come with the chamberlains: so the king was grieved and angered.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to his friends, Thus has Vashti spoken: pronounce therefore upon this <span class='add'>case</span> law and judgment.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Arkesaeus, and Sarsathaeus, and Malesear, the princes of the Persians and Medes, who were near the king, who sat chief <span class='add'>in rank</span> by the king, drew near to him,   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and reported to him according to the laws how it was proper to do to queen Vashti, because she had not done the things commanded of the king by the chamberlains.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Memucan said to the king and to the princes, Queen Vashti has not wronged the king only, but also all the king’s rulers and princes:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>for he has told them the words of the queen, and how she disobeyed the king. As then, <span class='add'>said he</span>, she refused <span class='add'>to obey</span> King Artaxerxes,   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>so this day shall the other ladies of the chiefs of the Persians and Medes, having heard what she said to the king, dare in the same way to dishonor their husbands.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>If then it seem good to the king, let him make a royal decree, and let it be written according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, and let him not alter <span class='add'>it</span>: and let not the queen come in to him anymore; and let the king give her royalty to a woman better than she.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And let the law of the king which he shall have made, be widely proclaimed, in his kingdom: and so shall all the women give honor to their husbands, from the poor even to the rich.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did as Memucan had said,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and sent into all his kingdom through the several provinces, according to their language, in order that men might be feared in their own houses.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
