And Elisha said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee; so they came to Bethel.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know, that the Lord this day is going to take thy lord away from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know <span class='add'>it</span>; be silent.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Elijah said to Elisha, Stay here, I pray thee; for the Lord has sent me to Jericho. And he said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee. And they came to Jericho.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho drew near to Elisha, and said to him, Dost thou know that the Lord is about to take away thy master today from thy head? And he said, Yea, I know <span class='add'>it</span>; hold your peace.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Elijah said to him, Stay here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. And Elisha said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives and thy soul lives, I will not leave thee: and they both went on.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets <span class='add'>went also</span>, and they stood opposite afar off: and both stood on <span class='add'>the bank</span> of Jordan.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the water: and the water was divided on this side and on that side, and they both went over on dry ground.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And it came to pass while they were crossing over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken up from thee. And Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double <span class='add'>portion</span> of thy spirit upon me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elijah said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: if thou shalt see me when I am taken up from thee, then shall it be so to thee; and if not, it shall not be <span class='add'>so</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass as they were going, they went on talking; and, behold, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and it separated between them both; and Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind as it were into heaven.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Elisha saw, and cried, Father, father, the chariot of Israel, and the horseman thereof! And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his garments, and rent them into two pieces.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Elisha took up the mantle of Elijah, which fell from off him upon Elisha; and Elisha returned, and stood upon the brink of Jordan;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and he took the mantle of Elijah, which fell from off him, and smote the water, and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and he smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho on the opposite side saw him, and said, The spirit of Elijah has rested upon Elisha. And they came to meet him, and did obeisance to him to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they said to him, Behold now, <span class='add'>there are</span> with thy servants fifty men of strength: let them go now, and seek thy lord: peradventure the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up, and cast him into Jordan, or on one of the mountains, or on one of the hills. And Elisha said, Ye shall not send.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And they pressed him until he was ashamed; and he said, Send. And they sent fifty men, and sought three days, and found him not.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they returned to him, for he dwelt in Jericho: and Elisha said, Did I not say to you, Go not?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, the situation of the city <span class='add'>is</span> good, as <span class='add'>our</span> lord sees; but the waters <span class='add'>are</span> bad, and the ground barren.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Elisha said, Bring me a new pitcher, and put salt in it. And they took <span class='add'>one</span>, and brought <span class='add'>it</span> to him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Elisha went out to the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and says, Thus saith the Lord, I have healed these waters; there shall not be any longer death thence or barren <span class='add'>land</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the waters were healed until this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went up thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way there came up also little children from the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, baldhead, go up.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he turned after them, and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And, behold, there came out two bears out of the wood, and they tore forty and two children of them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went thence to Mount Carmel, and returned thence to Samaria.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
