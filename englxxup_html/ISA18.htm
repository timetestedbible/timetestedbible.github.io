Who is beyond it? a nation not looked for, and trodden down.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Now all the rivers of the land shall be inhabited as an inhabited country; their land shall be as when a signal is raised from a mountain; it shall be audible as the sound of a trumpet.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be security in my city, as the light of noonday heat, and it shall be as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Before the reaping time, when the flower has been completely formed, and the unripe grape has put forth its flower and blossomed, then shall he take away the little clusters with pruning hooks, and shall take away the small branches, and cut them off;   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>and he shall leave <span class='add'>them</span> together to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth: and the fowls of the sky shall be gathered upon them, and all the beasts of the land shall come upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In that time shall presents be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people afflicted and peeled, and from a people great from henceforth and forever; a nation hoping and <span class='add'>yet</span> trodden down, which is in a part of a river of his land, to the place where is the name of the Lord of hosts, the Mount Zion.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
