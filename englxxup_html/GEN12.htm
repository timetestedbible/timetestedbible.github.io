And Abram built an altar there to the Lord, who appeared to him.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he departed thence to the mountain eastward of Bethel, and there he pitched his tent in Bethel near the sea, and Ai toward the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord, and called on the name of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Abram departed and went and encamped in the wilderness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine prevailed in the land.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Abram drew nigh to enter into Egypt, Abram said to Sarai his wife, I know that thou art a fair woman.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>It shall come to pass then that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they shall say, This is his wife, and they shall slay me, but they shall save thee alive.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Say, therefore, I am his sister, that it may be well with me on account of thee, and my soul shall live because of thee.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And it came to pass when Abram entered into Egypt—the Egyptians having seen his wife that she was very beautiful—   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>that the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh and brought her into the house of Pharaoh.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they treated Abram well on her account, and he had sheep, and calves, and asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and mules, and camels.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And God afflicted Pharaoh with great and severe afflictions, and his house, because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Pharaoh having called Abram, said, What is this thou hast done to me, that thou didst not tell me that she was thy wife?   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Wherefore didst thou say, She is my sister? and I took her for a wife to myself; and now, behold, thy wife is before thee, take her and go quickly away.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Pharaoh gave charge to men concerning Abram, to join in sending him forward, and his wife, and all that he had.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
