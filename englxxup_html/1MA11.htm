but King Ptolemy was exalted:   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>for Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander’s head, and sent it unto Ptolemy.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>King Ptolemy also died the third day after, and they that were in the strongholds were slain one of another.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore and seventh year.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were in Judea, to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made many engines of war against it.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Then certain ungodly persons, who hated their own people, went unto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately removing, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that he should not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with him at Ptolemais in great haste.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded to besiege it <span class='add'>still</span>: and he chose certain of the elders of Israel and the priests, and put himself in peril;   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and took silver and gold, and raiment, and diverse presents besides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he found favor in his sight.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And though certain ungodly men of the people had made complaints against him,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honors that he had before, and gave him preeminence among his chief friends.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea free from tribute, as also the three governments, with the country of Samaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of all these things after this manner:   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write unto our cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, who are our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of their good will toward us.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea, with the three governments of Aphairema and Lydda and Rathamin, that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and all things appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received of them yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and of trees.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithes and customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and the crown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of them all for their relief.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, and let it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>After this, when King Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces, every one to his own place, except certain bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of the heathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>Moreover there was one Trypho, that had been of Alexander’s part afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured against Demetrius, went to Imalkue the Arabian, that brought up Antiochus the young son of Alexander,   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>and lay sore upon him to deliver him <span class='add'>this young Antiochus</span>, that he might reign in his father’s stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were at enmity with him, and there he remained a long season.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>In the mean time Jonathan sent unto King Demetrius, that he would cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those also in the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only do this for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honor thee and thy nation, if opportunity serve.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to help me; for all my forces are gone from me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men unto Antioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very glad of their coming.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselves together into the midst of the city, to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the city kept the passages of the city, and began to fight.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto him all at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slew that day in the city to the number of a hundred thousand.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Also they set fire on the city, and got many spoils that day, and delivered the king.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>So when they of the city saw that the Jews had gotten the city as they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us and the city.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; and the Jews were honored in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realm; and they returned to Jerusalem, having great spoils.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>So King Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and the land was quiet before him.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spoke, and estranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he him according to the benefits which he had received of him, but troubled him very sore.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V54">54&#160;</span>After this returned Trypho, and with him the young child Antiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.   <span class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his back and fled.   <span class="verse" id="V56">56&#160;</span>Moreover Trypho took the elephants, and won Antioch.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, I confirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler over the four governments, and to be one of the king’s friends.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, and gave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple, and to wear a golden buckle.   <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>His brother Simon also he made captain from the place called The ladder of Tyre unto the borders of Egypt.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gathered themselves unto him for to help him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honorably.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.   <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan, he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief men for hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through the country unto Damascus.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius’ princes were come to Kadesh, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remove him out of the country,   <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>he went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the country.   <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>Then Simon encamped against Beth-zur, and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:   <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>but they desired to have peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, and set a garrison in it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water of Gennesaret, from whence betimes in the morning they got them to the plain of Hazor.   <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain, who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, came themselves over against him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and joined battle, all that were of Jonathan’s side fled;   <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the <span class='add'>son</span> of Absalom, and Judas the <span class='add'>son</span> of Chalphi, the captains of the host.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head, and prayed.   <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>Afterward turning again to battle, he put them to flight, and so they ran away.   <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turned again unto him, and with him pursued them to Kadesh, even unto their own tents, and there they camped.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V74">74&#160;</span>So there were slain of the heathen that day about three thousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
