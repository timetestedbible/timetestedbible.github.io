Fill thy horn with oil, and come, I will send thee to Jesse, to Bethlehem; for I have seen among his sons a king for me.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Samuel said, How can I go? whereas Saul will hear of it, and slay me: and the Lord said, Take a heifer in thy hand and thou shalt say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And thou shalt call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will make known to thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint him whom I shall mention to thee.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And Samuel did all that the Lord told him; and he came to Bethlehem: and the elders of the city were amazed at meeting him, and said, Dost thou come peaceably, thou Seer?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. Sanctify yourselves, and rejoice with me this day: and he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and he called them to the sacrifice.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And it came to pass when they came in, that he saw Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord’s anointed <span class='add'>is</span> before him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance, nor on his stature, for I have rejected him; for God sees not as a man looks; for man looks at the outward appearance, but God looks at the heart.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jesse called Abinadab, and he passed before Samuel: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jesse caused Shammah to pass by: and he said, Neither has God chosen this one.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Jesse caused his seven sons to pass before Samuel: and Samuel said, The Lord has not chosen these.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Samuel said to Jesse, Hast thou no more sons? And Jesse said, <span class='add'>There is</span> yet a little one; behold, he tends the flock. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him, for we may not sit down till he comes.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he sent and fetched him: and he was ruddy, with beauty of eyes, and very goodly to behold. And the Lord said to Samuel, Arise, and anoint David, for he is good.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward: and Samuel arose, and departed to Ramah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And Saul’s servants said to him, Behold now, an evil spirit from the Lord torments thee.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Let now thy servants speak before thee, and let them seek for our lord a man skilled to play on the harp; and it shall come to pass when an evil spirit comes upon thee and he shall play on his harp, that thou shalt be well, and he shall refresh thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said to his servants, Look now out for me a skillful player, and bring him to me.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And one of his servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, and he understands playing <span class='add'>on the harp</span>, and the man <span class='add'>is</span> prudent, and a warrior, and wise in speech, and the man <span class='add'>is</span> handsome, and the Lord <span class='add'>is</span> with him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying, Send to me thy son David who is with thy flock.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Jesse took a homer of bread, and a bottle of wine, and one kid of the goats, and sent them by the hand of his son David to Saul.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And David went in to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found grace in my eyes.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass when the evil spirit was upon Saul, that David took his harp, and played with his hand: and Saul was refreshed, and <span class='add'>it was</span> well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
