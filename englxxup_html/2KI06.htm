<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 6</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, Behold now, the place wherein we dwell before thee is too narrow for us.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and make for ourselves a habitation there.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said, Go. And one of them said gently, Come with thy servants. And he said, I will go.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went with them, and they came to Jordan, and began to cut down wood.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And behold, one was cutting down a beam, and the axe head fell into the water: and he cried out, Alas! master: and it was hidden.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? and he showed him the place: and he broke off a stick, and threw it in there, and the iron came to the surface.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he said, Take it up to thyself. And he stretched out his hand, and took it.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the king of Syria was at war with Israel: and he consulted with his servants, saying, I will encamp in such a place.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Elisha sent to the king of Israel, saying, Take heed that thou pass not by that place, for the Syrians are hidden there.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisha mentioned to him, and saved himself thence not once or twice.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the mind of the king of Syria was very much disturbed concerning this thing; and he called his servants, and said to them, Will ye not tell me who betrays me to the king of Israel?   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And one of his servants said, Nay, my Lord, O king, for Elisha the prophet that is in Israel reports to the king of Israel all the words whatsoever thou mayest say in thy bedchamber.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said, Go, see where this man <span class='add'>is</span>, and I will send and take him. And they sent word to him, saying, Behold, <span class='add'>he is</span> in Dothan.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he sent thither horses, and chariots, and a mighty host: and they came by night, and compassed about the city.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And the servant of Elisha rose up early and went out; and, behold, a host compassed the city, and horses and chariots: and the servant said to him, O master, what shall we do?   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Elisha said, Fear not, for they who are with us <span class='add'>are</span> more than they that are with them.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, open, I pray thee, the eyes of the servant, and let him see. And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw: and, behold, the mountain <span class='add'>was</span> full of horses, and there were chariots of fire round about Elisha.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they came down to him; and he prayed to the Lord, and said, Smite, I pray thee, this people with blindness. And he smote them with blindness, according to the word of Elisha.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Elisha said to them, This <span class='add'>is</span> not the city, and this <span class='add'>is</span> not the way: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them away to Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass when they entered into Samaria, that Elisha said, Open, I pray thee, O Lord, their eyes, and let them see. And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the king of Israel said to Elisha, when he saw them, Shall I <span class='add'>not</span> verily smite them, <span class='add'>my</span> father?   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he said, Thou shalt not smite them, unless thou wouldest smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow: set bread and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and depart to their master.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he set before them a great feast, and they ate and drank: and he dismissed them, and they departed to their master. And the bands of Syria came no longer into the land of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And it came to pass after this, that the son of Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up, and besieged Samaria.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass’s head was <span class='add'>valued</span> at fifty pieces of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung at five pieces of silver.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, and a woman cried to him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And he said to her, Unless the Lord help thee, whence shall I help thee? from the corn floor, or from the winepress?   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And the king said to her, What is <span class='add'>the matter</span> with thee? And the woman said to him, This <span class='add'>woman</span> said to me, Give thy son, and we will eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>So we boiled my son, and ate him; and I said to her on the second day, Give thy son, and let us eat him: and she has hidden her son.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, <span class='add'>that</span> he rent his garments; and he passed by on the wall, and the people saw sackcloth within upon his flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha shall stand upon him this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him; and <span class='add'>the king</span> sent a man before him: before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, Do ye see that this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? See, as soon as the messenger shall have come, shut the door, and forcibly detain him at the door: <span class='add'>is</span> not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>While he was yet speaking with them, behold, a messenger came to him: and he said, Behold, this evil <span class='add'>is</span> of the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?   </div><ul class='tnav'>
