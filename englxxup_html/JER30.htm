Dig deep for a dwelling, ye that inhabit Dedan, for he has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I visited him.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>For grape-gatherers are come, who shall not leave thee a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall lay their hand upon <span class='add'>thy possessions</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For I have stripped Esau, I have uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they have perished <span class='add'>each</span> by the hand of his brother, my neighbor, and it is impossible   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>for thy fatherless one to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For thus saith the Lord; They who were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk <span class='add'>it</span>; and thou shalt by no means be cleared:   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>for by myself I have sworn, saith the Lord, that thou shalt be in the midst of her an impassable <span class='add'>land</span>, and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert forever.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I have heard a report from the Lord, and he has sent messengers to the nations, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Assemble yourselves, and come against her; rise ye up to war.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>I have made thee small among the nations, utterly contemptible among men.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Thine insolence has risen up against thee, the fierceness of thy heart has burst the holes of the rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set his nest on high: thence will I bring thee down.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Edom shall be a desert: everyone that passes by shall hiss at it.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrah and they that sojourned in her, saith the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man inhabit there.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, he shall come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Aetham: for I will speedily drive them from it, and do ye set the young men against her: for who is like me?
