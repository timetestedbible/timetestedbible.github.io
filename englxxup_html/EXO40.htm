and thou shalt bring in the candlestick and place its lamps on it.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And thou shalt place the golden altar, to burn incense before the ark; and thou shalt put a covering of a veil on the door of the tabernacle of witness.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And thou shalt put the altar of burnt offerings by the doors of the tabernacle of witness,   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>and thou shalt set up the tabernacle round about, and thou shalt hallow all that belongs to it round about.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and shalt anoint the tabernacle, and all things in it; and shalt sanctify it, and all its furniture, and it shall be holy.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt offerings, and all its furniture; and thou shalt hallow the altar, and the altar shall be most holy.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the doors of the tabernacle of witness, and thou shalt wash them with water.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And thou shalt put on Aaron the holy garments, and thou shalt anoint him, and thou shalt sanctify him, and he shall minister to me as priest.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And thou shalt bring up his sons, and shalt put garments on them.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And thou shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint their father, and they shall minister to me as priests; and it shall be that they shall have an everlasting anointing of priesthood, throughout their generations.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Moses did all things whatsoever the Lord commanded him, so did he.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year after their going forth out of Egypt, at the new moon, that the tabernacle was set up.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Moses set up the tabernacle, and put on the chapiters, and put the bars into their places, and set up the posts.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he stretched out the curtains over the tabernacle, and put the veil of the tabernacle on it above as the Lord commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And he took the testimonies, and put them into the ark; and he put the staffs by the sides of the ark.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and put on <span class='add'>it</span> the covering of the veil, and covered the ark of the testimony, as the Lord commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he put the table in the tabernacle of witness, on the north side without the veil of the tabernacle.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he put on it the showbread before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he put the candlestick into the tabernacle of witness, on the side of the tabernacle toward the south.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he put on it its lamps before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And he put the golden altar in the tabernacle of witness before the veil;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and he burned on it incense of composition, as the Lord commanded Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he put the altar of the burnt offerings by the doors of the tabernacle.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar; and Moses accomplished all the works.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the cloud covered the tabernacle of witness, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Moses was not able to enter into the tabernacle of testimony, because the cloud overshadowed it, and the tabernacle was filled with the glory of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, the children of Israel prepared to depart with their baggage.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And if the cloud went not up, they did not prepare to depart, till the day when the cloud went up.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>For a cloud was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night before all Israel, in all their journeyings.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
