 </div><div class='q'>Or who shall withstand thy judgment?  </div><div class='q'>Or who shall accuse thee for the nations that perish, whom thou hast made?  </div><div class='q'>Or who shall come to stand against thee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all,  </div><div class='q'>To whom thou mightest show that thy judgment is not unright.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face against thee for any whom thou hast punished.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderest all things righteously:  </div><div class='q'>Thinking it not agreeable with thy power  </div><div class='q'>To condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For thy power is the beginning of righteousness,  </div><div class='q'>And because thou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power, thou showest thy strength,  </div><div class='q'>And among them that know it thou makest their boldness manifest.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity,  </div><div class='q'>And orderest us with great favor:  </div><div class='q'>For thou mayest use power when thou wilt.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But by such works hast thou taught thy people  </div><div class='q'>That the just man should be merciful,  </div><div class='q'>And hast made thy children to be of a good hope  </div><div class='q'>That thou givest repentance for sins.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and the condemned to death, with such deliberation,  </div><div class='q'>Giving them time and place whereby they might be delivered from their malice:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine own sons,  </div><div class='q'>Unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants of good promises?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest our enemies a thousand times more,  </div><div class='q'>To the intent that, when we judge, we should carefully think of thy goodness,  </div><div class='q'>And when we ourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely and unrighteously,  </div><div class='q'>Thou hast tormented them with their own abominations.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>For they went astray very far in the ways of error,  </div><div class='q'>And held them for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies were despised,  </div><div class='q'>Being deceived, as children of no understanding.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason,  </div><div class='q'>Thou didst send a judgment to mock them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But they that would not be reformed by that correction, wherein he dallied with them,  </div><div class='q'>Shall feel a judgment worthy of God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For, look, for what things they grudged, when they were punished,  </div><div class='q'>That is, for them whom they thought to be gods; <span class='add'>now</span> being punished in them,  </div><div class='q'>When they saw it, they acknowledged him to be the true God, whom before they denied to know;  </div><div class='q'>And therefore came extreme damnation upon them.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
