The zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The Lord has sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And God shall dash down them that rise up against him on Mount Zion, and shall scatter his enemies;   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span><span class='add'>even</span> Syria from the rising of the sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, who devour Israel with open mouth.
