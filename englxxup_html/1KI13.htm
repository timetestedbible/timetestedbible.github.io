And, behold, his hand, which he stretched forth against him, withered, and he could not draw it back to himself.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the altar was rent, and the fatness was poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God gave by the word of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And King Jeroboam said to the man of God, Entreat the Lord thy God, and let my hand be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord, and he restored the king’s hand to him, and it became as before.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the king said to the man of God, Enter with me into the house, and dine, and I will give thee a gift.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the man of God said to the king, If thou shouldest give me the half of thy house, I would not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place; for thus the Lord charged me by <span class='add'>his</span> word, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Eat no bread, and drink no water, and return not by the way by which thou camest.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So he departed by another way, and returned not by the way by which he came to Bethel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God did on that day in Bethel, and the words which he spoke to the king: and they turned the face of their father.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And their father spoke to them, saying, Which way went he? and his sons show him the way by which the man of God who came out of Judah went up.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And he said to his sons, Saddle me the ass: and they saddled him the ass, and he mounted it,   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said to him, Art thou the man of God that came out of Judah? And he said to him, I <span class='add'>am</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he said to him, Come with me, and eat bread.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And he said, I shall not by any means be able to return with thee, neither will I eat bread, neither will I drink water in this place.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For thus the Lord commanded me by word, saying, Eat not bread there, and drink not water, and return not thither by the way by which thou camest.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And he said to him, I also am a prophet as thou <span class='add'>art</span>; and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back to thee into thy house, and let him eat bread and drink water: but he lied to him.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And he brought him back, and he ate bread and drank water in his house.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And it came to pass while they were sitting at the table, that the word of the Lord came to the prophet that brought him back;   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>and he spoke to the man of God that came out of Judah, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast resisted the word of the Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which the Lord thy God commanded thee,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>but hast returned, and eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he spoke to thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat bread, and shalt not drink water; <span class='add'>therefore</span> thy body shall in nowise enter into the sepulcher of thy fathers.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And it came to pass after he had eaten bread and drunk water, that he saddled the ass for him, and he turned and departed.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And a lion found him in the way, and slew him; and his body was cast out in the way, and the ass was standing by it, and the lion <span class='add'>also</span> was standing by the body.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And, behold, men <span class='add'>were</span> passing by, and saw the carcass cast in the way, and the lion was standing near the carcass: and they went in and spoke <span class='add'>of it</span> in the city where the old prophet dwelt.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>the prophet</span> that turned him back out of the way heard, and said, This is the man of God who rebelled against the word of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And he went and found the body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion were standing by the body: and the lion had not devoured the body of the man of God, and had not torn the ass.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And the prophet took up the body of the man of God, and laid it on his ass; and the prophet brought him back to his city, to bury him in his own tomb,   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>and they bewailed him, <span class='add'>saying</span>, Alas, brother.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And it came to pass after he had lamented him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, Whenever I die, bury me in this tomb wherein the man of God is buried; lay me by his bones, that my bones may be preserved with his bones.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>For the word will surely come to pass which he spoke by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel, and against the high houses in Samaria.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And after this Jeroboam turned not from his sin, but he turned and made of part of the people priests of the <span class='add'>high places</span>: whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became a priest for the high places.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, even to its destruction and its removal from the face of the earth.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
