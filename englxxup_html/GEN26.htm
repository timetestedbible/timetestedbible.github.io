And Isaac said to him, <span class='add'>I did so</span>, for I said, Lest at any time I die on her account.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to him, Why hast thou done this to us? one of my kindred within a little had lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought <span class='add'>a sin of</span> ignorance upon us.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, Every man that touches this man and his wife shall be liable to death.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Isaac sowed in that land, and he found in that year barley a hundredfold, and the Lord blessed him.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the man was exalted, and advancing he increased, till he became very great.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And he had cattle of sheep, and cattle of oxen, and many tilled lands, and the Philistines envied him.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And all the wells which the servants of his father had dug in the time of his father, the Philistines stopped them, and filled them with earth.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Abimelech said to Isaac, Depart from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Isaac departed thence, and rested in the Valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Isaac dug again the wells of water, which the servants of his father Abraham had dug, and the Philistines had stopped them, after the death of his father Abraham; and he gave them names, according to the names by which his father named them.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And the servants of Isaac dug in the Valley of Gerar, and they found there a well of living water.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the shepherds of Gerar strove with the shepherds of Isaac, saying that the water was theirs; and they called the name of the well, Injury, for they injured him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And having departed thence he dug another well, and they strove also for that; and he named the name of it, Enmity.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And he departed thence and dug another well; and they did not strive about that; and he named the name of it, Room, saying, Because now the Lord has made room for us, and has increased us upon the earth.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And he went up thence to the well of the oath.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And the Lord appeared to him in that night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee, and I will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for the sake of Abraham thy father.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he built there an altar, and called on the name of the Lord, and there he pitched his tent, and there the servants of Isaac dug a well in the Valley of Gerar.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And Abimelech came to him from Gerar, and so did Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the commander-in-chief of his army.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Isaac said to them, Wherefore have ye come to me? whereas ye hated me, and sent me away from you.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And they said, We have surely seen that the Lord was with thee, and we said, Let there be an oath between us and thee, and we will make a covenant with thee,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>that thou shalt do no wrong by us, as we have not abhorred thee, and according as we have treated thee well, and have sent thee forth peaceably; and now thou art blessed of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And they arose in the morning, and swore each to his neighbor; and Isaac sent them forth, and they departed from him in safety.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And it came to pass in that day, that the servants of Isaac came and told him of the well which they had dug; and they said, We have not found water.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And he called it, Oath: therefore he called the name of that city, the Well of Oath, until this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Esau was forty years old; and he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And they were provoking to Isaac and Rebekah.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
