And the woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on thy breast and belly thou shalt go, and thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed, he shall watch against thy head, and thou shalt watch against his heel.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings; in pain thou shalt bring forth children, and thy submission shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it only not to eat—of that thou hast eaten, cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the ground in thy labors, in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread until thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken, for earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all living.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now lest at any time he stretch forth his hand, and take of the tree of life and eat, and <span class='add'>so</span> he shall live forever—   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of Delight to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he cast out Adam and caused him to dwell over against the garden of Delight, and stationed the cherubs and the fiery sword that turns about to keep the way of the tree of life.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
