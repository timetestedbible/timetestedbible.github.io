teach us wherewith we shall send it away to its place.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And they said, If ye send away the ark of the covenant of the Lord God of Israel, do not on any account send it away empty, but by all means render to it an offering for the plague; and then shall ye be healed, and an atonement shall be made for you: should not his hand be <span class='add'>thus</span> stayed from off you?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And they say, What <span class='add'>is</span> the offering for the plague <span class='add'>which</span> we shall return to it? and they said,   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>According to the number of the lords of the Philistines, five golden emerods, for the plague was on you, and on your rulers, and on the people; and golden mice, the likeness of the mice that destroy your land: and ye shall give glory to the Lord, that he may lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And why do ye harden your hearts, as Egypt and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?
