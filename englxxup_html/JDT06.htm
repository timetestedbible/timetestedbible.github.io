Then Uzziah asked him of that which was done.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he answered and declared unto them the words of the council of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken in the midst of the princes of Assyria, and whatsoever Holofernes had spoken proudly against the house of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Then the people fell down and worshiped God, and cried unto God, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the low estate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that are sanctified unto thee this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And Uzziah took him out of the assembly unto his house, and made a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israel all that night for help.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
