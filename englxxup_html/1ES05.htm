the Lord both morning and evening.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commanded in the law, and <span class='add'>offered</span> sacrifices

class="verse" id="V55">55&#160;</span>Unto them of Sidon also and Tyre they gave carts, that they should bring cedar trees from Lebanon, which should be brought by floats to the haven of Joppa,

temple of God at Jerusalem began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and their brethren, and the priests, and the Levites, and all they that were come unto Jerusalem out of the captivity:   <span class="verse" id="V57">57&#160;</span>and they laid the foundation of the house of God in the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come to Jewry and Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V58">58&#160;</span>And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over the works of the Lord. Then stood up Jeshua, and his sons and brethren, and Kadmiel his brother, and the sons of Emadabun, with the sons of Joda the son of Iliadun, with their sons and brethren, all Levites, with one accord setters-forward of the business, laboring to advance the works in the house of the Lord. So the builders built the temple of the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V59">59&#160;</span>And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musical instruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph had cymbals,   <span class="verse" id="V60">60&#160;</span>singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord, according as David the king of Israel had ordained.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V61">61&#160;</span>And they sung <span class='add'>with</span> loud voices songs to the praise of the Lord, because his mercy and glory is forever in all Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V62">62&#160;</span>And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loud voice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for the rearing up of the house of the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V63">63&#160;</span>Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of their families, the ancients who had seen the former house came to the building of this with weeping and great crying.   <span class="verse" id="V64">64&#160;</span>But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,   <span class="verse" id="V65">65&#160;</span>insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weeping of the people; yet the multitude sounded marvelously, so that it was heard afar off.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V66">66&#160;</span>Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin heard it, they came to know what the noise of trumpets <span class='add'>should mean</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V67">67&#160;</span>And they perceived that they that were of the captivity did build the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V68">68&#160;</span>So they went to Zerubbabel and Jeshua, and to the chief of the families, and said unto them, We will build together with you.   <span class="verse" id="V69">69&#160;</span>For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrifice unto him from the days of Esar-haddon the king of the Assyrians, who brought us hither.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V70">70&#160;</span>Then Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the chief of the families of Israel said unto them, It is not for us and you to build together a house unto the Lord our God.   <span class="verse" id="V71">71&#160;</span>We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel, according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us.   <span class="verse" id="V72">72&#160;</span>But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitants of Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building;   <span class="verse" id="V73">73&#160;</span>and by their secret plots, and popular persuasions and commotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all the time that King Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from building for the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
