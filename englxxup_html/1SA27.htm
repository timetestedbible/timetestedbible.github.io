And David said to Achish, On the south of Judea, and on the south of Jesmega, and on the south of the Kenite.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I have not saved man or woman alive to bring them to Gath, saying, Lest they carry a report to Gath against us, saying, These things David does. And this was his manner all the days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So David had the full confidence of Achish, who said, He is thoroughly disgraced among his people in Israel, and he shall be my servant forever.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
