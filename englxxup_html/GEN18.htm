<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 18</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>And God appeared to him by the oak of Mamre, as he sat by the door of his tent at noon.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And he lifted up his eyes and beheld, and lo! three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and did obeisance to the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And he said, Lord, if indeed I have found grace in thy sight, pass not by thy servant.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Let water now be brought, and let them wash your feet, and do ye refresh <span class='add'>yourselves</span> under the tree.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I will bring bread, and ye shall eat, and after this ye shall depart on your journey, on account of which <span class='add'>refreshment</span> ye have turned aside to your servant. And he said, So do, as thou hast said.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Abraham hastened to the tent to Sarah, and said to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And Abraham ran to the kine, and took a young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hastened to dress it.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he answered and said, Behold! in the tent.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he said, I will return and come to thee according to this period seasonably, and Sarah thy wife shall have a son; and Sarah heard at the door of the tent, being behind him.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in days, and the custom of women ceased with Sarah.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Sarah laughed in herself, saying, The thing has not as yet happened to me, even until now, and my lord is old.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Abraham, Why is it that Sarah has laughed in herself, saying, Shall I then indeed bear? but I am grown old.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Shall anything be impossible with the Lord? At this time I will return to thee seasonably, and Sarah shall have a son.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But Sarah denied, saying, I did not laugh, for she was afraid. And he said to her, Nay, but thou didst laugh.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the men having risen up from thence looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah. And Abraham went with them, attending them on their journey.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham my servant what things I intend to do?   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But Abraham shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For I know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraham all things whatsoever he has spoken to him.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah has been increased toward me, and their sins are very great.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>I will therefore go down and see, if they completely correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may know.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And the men having departed thence, came to Sodom; and Abraham was still standing before the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Abraham drew nigh and said, Wouldest thou destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous be as the wicked?   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Should there be fifty righteous in the city, wilt thou destroy them? wilt thou not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>By no means shalt thou do as this thing <span class='add'>is</span> so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous shall be as the wicked: by no means. Thou that judgest the whole earth, shalt thou not do right?   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the Lord said, If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole city, and the whole place for their sakes.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Abraham answered and said, Now I have begun to speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, wilt thou destroy the whole city because of the five <span class='add'>wanting</span>? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And he continued to speak to him still, and said, But if there should be found there forty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the forty’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And he said, Will there be anything <span class='add'>against me</span>, Lord, if I shall speak? but if there be found there thirty? And he said, I will not destroy it for the thirty’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he said, Will there be anything <span class='add'>against me</span>, Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And the Lord departed, when he left off speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
