all were gathered by <span class='add'>their</span> names.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I proclaimed there a fast, at the river Ahava, that <span class='add'>we</span> should humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a straight way for us, and for our children, and for all our property.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For I was ashamed to ask of the king a guard and horsemen to save us from the enemy in the way: for we had spoken to the king, saying, The hand of our God <span class='add'>is</span> upon all that seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath <span class='add'>are</span> upon all that forsake him.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>So we fasted, and asked of our God concerning this; and he hearkened to us.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And I gave charge to twelve of the chiefs of the priests, to Sherebiah, to Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And I weighed to them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of the firstfruits of the house of our God, which the king, and his counselors, and his princes, and all Israel that were found, had dedicated.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>I even weighed into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred silver vessels, and a hundred talents of gold;   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>and twenty golden bowls, <span class='add'>weighing</span> about a thousand drachmas, and superior vessels of fine shining brass, <span class='add'>precious</span> as gold.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And I said to them, Ye <span class='add'>are</span> holy to the Lord; and the vessels <span class='add'>are</span> holy; and the silver and the gold are freewill offerings to the Lord God of our fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Be watchful and keep them, until ye weigh <span class='add'>them</span> before the chief priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of families in Jerusalem, at the chambers of the house of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>So the priests and the Levites took the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring to Jerusalem into the house of our God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to come to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy and adversary in the way.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it came to pass on the fourth day that we weighed the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, in the house of our God, into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest;
