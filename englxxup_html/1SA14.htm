but he told not his father.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And Saul sat on the top of the hill under the pomegranate tree that is in Migron, and there were with him about six hundred men.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And Ahijah son of Ahitub, the brother of Ichabod the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, <span class='add'>was</span> the priest of God in Shiloh wearing an ephod: and the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And in the midst of the passage whereby Jonathan sought to pass over to the encampment of the Philistines, there was both a sharp rock on this side, and a sharp rock on the other side: the name of the one <span class='add'>was</span> Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The one way <span class='add'>was</span> northward to one coming to Michmash, and the other way <span class='add'>was</span> southward to one coming to Geba.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armor, Come, let us go over to Messab of these uncircumcised, if <span class='add'>peradventure</span> the Lord may do something for us; for the Lord is not straitened to save by many or by few.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And his armor bearer said to him, Do all that thy heart inclines toward: behold, I <span class='add'>am</span> with thee, my heart <span class='add'>is</span> as thy heart.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Jonathan said, Behold, we will go over to the men, and will come down suddenly upon them.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>If they should say thus to us, Stand aloof there until we shall send you word; then we will stand still by ourselves, and will not go up against them.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span><span class='add'>But</span> if they should say thus to us, Come up to us; then will we go up, for the Lord has delivered them into our hands; this <span class='add'>shall be</span> a sign to us.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And they both went in to Messab of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of their caves, where they had hidden themselves.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And the men of Messab answered Jonathan and his armor bearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing: and Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me, for the Lord has delivered them into the hands of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Jonathan went up on his hands and feet, and his armor bearer with him; and they looked on the face of Jonathan, and he smote them, and his armor bearer did smite <span class='add'>them</span> after him.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And the first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer effected was twenty men, with darts and slings, and pebbles of the field.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And there was dismay in the camp, and in the field; and all the people in Messab, and the spoilers were amazed; and they would not act, and the land was terror struck, and there was dismay from the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And the watchmen of Saul beheld in Gibeah of Benjamin, and, behold, the army was thrown into confusion on every side.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Saul said to the people with him, Number yourselves now, and see who has gone out from you: and they numbered themselves, and behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not found.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And Saul said to Ahijah, Bring the ephod; for he wore the ephod in that day before Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And it came to pass while Saul was speaking to the priest, that the sound in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase greatly; and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw thy hands.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Saul went up and all the people that were with him, and they come to the battle: and, behold, <span class='add'>every</span> man’s sword was against his neighbor, a very great confusion.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And the servants who had been before with the Philistines, who had gone up to the army, turned themselves also to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And all the Israelites who were hidden in Mount Ephraim heard also that the Philistines fled; and they also gather themselves after them to battle: and the Lord saved Israel in that day; and the war passed through Bamoth; and all the people with Saul were about ten thousand men.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And the battle extended itself to every city in the Mount Ephraim.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Saul committed a great trespass of ignorance in that day, and he lays a curse on the people, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the man who shall eat bread before the evening; so I will avenge myself on my enemy: and none of the people tasted bread, though all the land was dining.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Jaal was a wood abounding in swarms of bees on the face of the ground.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And the people went into the place of the bees, and, behold, they continued speaking; and, behold, there was none that put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And Jonathan had not heard when his father adjured the people; and he reached forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it into the honeycomb, and returned his hand to his mouth, and his eyes recovered their sight.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>And one of the people answered and said, Thy father solemnly adjured the people, saying, Cursed <span class='add'>is</span> the man who shall eat bread today. And the people were very faint,   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>and Jonathan knew it, and said, My father has destroyed the land: see how my eyes have received sight <span class='add'>now</span> that I have tasted a little of this honey.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>Surely if the people had this day eaten freely of the spoils of their enemies which they found, the slaughter among the Philistines would have been greater.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>And on that day he smote some of the Philistines in Michmash; and the people were very weary.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And the people turned to the spoil; and the people took flocks, and herds, and calves, and slew them on the ground, and the people ate with the blood.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And it was reported to Saul, saying, The people have sinned against the Lord, eating with the blood: and Saul said, Out of Getthaim roll a great stone to me hither.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them to bring hither every one his calf, and every one his sheep: and let them slay it on this <span class='add'>stone</span> and sin not against the Lord in eating with the blood: and the people brought each one that which was in his hand, and they slew <span class='add'>them</span> there.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And Saul built an altar there to the Lord: this was the first altar that Saul built to the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines this night, and let us plunder among them till the day break, and let us not leave a man among them. And they said, Do all that is good in thy sight: and the priest said, Let us draw nigh hither to God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>And Saul inquired of God, If I go down after the Philistines, wilt thou deliver them into the hands of Israel? And he answered him not in that day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And Saul said, Bring hither all the chiefs of Israel, and know and see by whom this sin has been committed this day.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>For as the Lord lives who has saved Israel, if answer should be against my son Jonathan, he shall surely die. And there was no one that answered out of all the people.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And he said to all the men of Israel, Ye shall be under subjection, and I and Jonathan my son will be under subjection: and the people said to Saul, Do that which is good in thy sight.   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>And Saul said, O Lord God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? <span class='add'>is</span> the iniquity in me, or in Jonathan my son? Lord God of Israel, give clear <span class='add'>manifestations</span>; and if <span class='add'>the lot</span> should declare this, give, I pray thee, to thy people Israel, give, I pray, holiness. And Jonathan and Saul are taken, and the people escaped.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Saul said, Cast <span class='add'>lots</span> between me and my son Jonathan: whomsoever the Lord shall cause to be taken by lot, let him die: and the people said to Saul, This thing is not <span class='add'>to be done</span>: and Saul prevailed against the people, and they cast <span class='add'>lots</span> between him and Jonathan his son, and Jonathan is taken by lot.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>And Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done: and Jonathan told him, and said, I did indeed taste a little honey, with the end of my staff that was in my hand, and, lo! I <span class='add'>am to</span> die.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And Saul said to him, God do so to me, and more also, thou shalt surely die today.   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>And the people said to Saul, Shall he that has wrought this great salvation in Israel be put to death this day? <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, there shall not fall to the ground one of the hairs of his head; for the people of God have wrought successfully this day. And the people prayed for Jonathan in that day, and he died not.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And Saul went up from following the Philistines; and the Philistines departed to their place.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>And Saul received the kingdom, by lot he inherits the office <span class='add'>of ruling</span> over Israel: and he fought against all his enemies round about, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against the children of Edom, and against Beth-aeor, and against the king of Zobah, and against the Philistines: whithersoever he turned, he was victorious.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>And he wrought valiantly, and smote Amalek, and rescued Israel out of the hand of them that trampled on him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>And the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchi-shua: and <span class='add'>these were</span> the names of his two daughters, the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the second Michal.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>And the name of his wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of his captain of the host was Abner, the son of Ner, son of a kinsman of Saul.   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>And Kish <span class='add'>was</span> the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, <span class='add'>was</span> son of Jamin, son of Abiel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>And the war was vehement against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any mighty man, and any valiant man, then he took them to himself.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
