Thus saith the Lord, Because my people was taken for nothing, wonder ye and howl. Thus saith the Lord, On account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Therefore shall my people know my name in that day, for I am he that speaks: I am present,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>as a season of beauty upon the mountains, as the feet of one preaching glad tidings of peace, as one preaching good news: for I will publish thy salvation, saying, O Zion, thy God shall reign.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the voice of them that guard thee is exalted, and with the voice together they shall rejoice: for eyes shall look to eyes, when the Lord shall have mercy upon Zion.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let the waste places of Jerusalem break forth <span class='add'>in</span> joy together, because the Lord has had mercy upon her, and has delivered Jerusalem.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the Lord shall reveal his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation that <span class='add'>comes</span> from our God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Depart ye, depart, go out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For ye shall not go forth with tumult, neither go by flight: for the Lord shall go first in advance of you; and the God of Israel shall be he that brings up your rear.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Behold, my servant shall understand, and be exalted, and glorified exceedingly.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>As many shall be amazed at thee, so shall thy face be without glory from men, and thy glory <span class='add'>shall not be honored</span> by the sons of men.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thus shall many nations wonder at him; and kings shall keep their mouths shut: for they to whom no report was brought concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall consider.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
