I have commanded thee; be strong and courageous, be not cowardly nor fearful, for the Lord thy God is with thee in all places whither thou goest.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Joshua commanded the scribes of the people, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying, Prepare provisions; for yet three days and ye shall go over this Jordan, entering in to take possession of the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives to you.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And to Reuben, and to Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Remember the word which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, The Lord your God has caused you to rest, and has given you this land.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Let your wives and your children and your cattle dwell in the land, which he has given you; and ye shall go over well armed before your brethren, every one of you who is strong; and ye shall fight on their side;   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>until the Lord your God shall have given your brethren rest, as also to you, and they also shall have inherited the land, which the Lord your God gives them; then ye shall depart each one to his inheritance, which Moses gave you beyond Jordan eastward.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And they answered Joshua and said, We will do all things which thou commandest us, and we will go to every place whither thou shalt send us.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Whereinsoever we hearkened to Moses we will hearken to thee; only let the Lord our God be with thee, as he was with Moses.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And whosoever shall disobey thee, and whosoever shall not hearken to thy words as thou shalt command him, let him die; but be thou strong and courageous.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
