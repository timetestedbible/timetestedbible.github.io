<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 5</div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>Now Naaman, the captain of the host of Syria, was a great man before his master, and highly respected, because by him the Lord had given deliverance to Syria, and the man was mighty in strength, <span class='add'>but</span> a leper.   <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>And the Syrians went forth in small bands, and took captive out of the land of Israel a little maid: and she waited on Naaman’s wife.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And she said to her mistress, O that my lord were before the prophet of God in Samaria; then he would recover him from his leprosy.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And she went in and told her lord, and said, Thus and thus spoke the maid from the land of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And the king of Syria said to Naaman, Go to, go, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he went, and took in his hand ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now then, as soon as this letter shall reach thee, behold, I have sent to thee my servant Naaman, and thou shalt recover him from his leprosy.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel read the letter, <span class='add'>that</span> he rent his garments, and said, <span class='add'>Am</span> I God, to kill and to make alive, that this <span class='add'>man</span> sends to me to recover a man of his leprosy? consider, however, I pray you, and see that this <span class='add'>man</span> seeks an occasion against me.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And it came to pass, when Elisha heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy garments? Let Naaman, I pray thee, come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Naaman came with horse and chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash seven times in Jordan, and thy flesh shall return to thee, and thou shalt be cleansed.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Naaman was angry, and departed, and said, Behold, I said, He will by all means come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of his God, and lay his hand upon the place, and recover the leper.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span><span class='add'>Are</span> not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not go and wash in them, and be cleansed? and he turned and went away in a rage.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And his servants came near and said to him, <span class='add'>Suppose</span> the prophet had spoken a great thing to thee, wouldest thou not perform it? yet he has but said to thee, Wash, and be cleansed.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>So Naaman went down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the word of Elisha: and his flesh returned to him as the flesh of a little child, and he was cleansed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he and all his company returned to Elisha, and he came and stood before him, and said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth, save only in Israel: and now receive a blessing of thy servant.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And Elisha said, <span class='add'>As</span> the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not take <span class='add'>one</span>. And he pressed him to take <span class='add'>one</span>: but he would not.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And Naaman said, Well then, if not, let there be given to thy servant, I pray thee, the load <span class='add'>of a</span> yoke of mules; and thou shalt give me of the red earth: for henceforth thy servant will not offer whole burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord by <span class='add'>reason of</span> this thing.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And let the Lord be propitious to thy servant when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he shall lean on my hand, and I shall bow down in the house of Rimmon when he bows down in the house of Rimmon; even let the Lord, I pray, be merciful to thy servant in this matter.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And Elisha said to Naaman, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Gehazi the servant of Elisha said, Behold, my Lord has spared this Syrian Naaman, so as not to take of his hand what he has brought: as the Lord lives, I will surely run after him, and take somewhat of him.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>So Gehazi followed after Naaman: and Naaman saw him running after him, and turned back from his chariot to meet him.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Gehazi</span> said, All is well: my master has sent me, saying, Behold, now are there come to me two young men of the sons of the prophets from Mount Ephraim; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And <span class='add'>Naaman</span> said, Take two talents of silver. And he took two talents of silver in two bags, and two changes of raiment, and put them upon two of his servants, and they bore them before him.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And he came to a secret place, and took them from their hands, and laid them up in the house, and dismissed the men.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And he went in himself and stood before his master; and Elisha said to him,   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Whence <span class='add'>comest thou</span>, Gehazi? and Gehazi said, Thy servant has not been hither or thither. And Elisha said to him, Went not my heart with thee, when the man returned from his chariot to meet thee? and now thou hast received silver, and now thou hast received raiment, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>The leprosy also of Naaman shall cleave to thee, and to thy seed forever. And he went out from his presence leprous, like snow.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
