and wherefore are ye come to me now when ye want me?   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore have we now turned to thee, that thou shouldest go with us, and fight against the sons of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If ye turn me back to fight with the children of Ammon, and the Lord should deliver them before me, then will I be your head.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The Lord be witness between us, if we shall not do according to thy word.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and ruler over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have I to do with thee, that thou hast come against me to fight in my land?
