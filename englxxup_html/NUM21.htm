Hast thou brought us out of Egypt to slay us in the wilderness? for there is not bread nor water; and our soul loathes this light bread.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord sent among the people deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and much people of the children of Israel died.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray therefore to the Lord, and let him take away the serpent from us.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And Moses prayed to the Lord for the people; and the Lord said to Moses, Make thee a serpent, and put it on a signal-<span class='add'>staff</span>; and it shall come to pass that whenever a serpent shall bite a man, everyone <span class='add'>so</span> bitten that looks upon it shall live.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a signal-<span class='add'>staff</span>: and it came to pass that whenever a serpent bit a man, and he looked on the brazen serpent, he lived.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And the children of Israel departed, and encamped in Oboth.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And having departed from Oboth, they encamped in Achalgai, on the farther side in the wilderness, which is opposite Moab, toward the east.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And thence they departed, and encamped in the Valley of Zered.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And they departed thence and encamped on the other side of Arnon in the wilderness, <span class='add'>the country</span> which extends from the coasts of the Amorites; for Arnon is the borders of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Therefore it is said in a book,  </div><div class='q'>A war of the Lord has set on fire Zoob,  </div><div class='q'>And the brooks of Arnon.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he has appointed brooks to cause Ar to dwell <span class='add'>there</span>;  </div><div class='q'>And it lies near to the coasts of Moab.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And thence <span class='add'>they came to</span> the well; this <span class='add'>is</span> the well of which the Lord said to Moses, Gather the people, and I will give them water to drink.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Then Israel sang this song at the well,  </div><div class='q'>Begin <span class='add'>to sing</span> of the well;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The princes dug it,  </div><div class='q'>The kings of the nations in their kingdom,  </div><div class='q'>In their lordship sank it in the rock:  </div><div class='m'>and <span class='add'>they went</span> from the well to Mattanah,   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to Janen, which is in the plain of Moab <span class='add'>as seen</span> from the top of the quarried <span class='add'>rock</span> that looks toward the wilderness.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And Moses sent ambassadors to Sihon king of the Amorites, with peaceable words, saying,   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>We will pass through thy land, we will go by the road; we will not turn aside to the field or to the vineyard.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>We will not drink water out of thy well; we will go by the king’s highway, until we have past thy boundaries.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And Sihon did not allow Israel to pass through his borders, and Sihon gathered all his people, and went out to set the battle in array against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jahaz, and set the battle in array against Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>And Israel smote him with the slaughter of the sword, and they became possessors of his land, from Arnon to Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon, for Jazer is the borders of the children of Ammon.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>And Israel took all their cities, and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all cities belonging to it.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For Heshbon is the city of Sihon king of the Amorites; and he before fought against the king of Moab, and they took all his land, from Aroer to Arnon.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Therefore say they who deal in dark speeches,  </div><div class='q'>Come to Heshbon,  </div><div class='q'>That the city of Sihon may be built and prepared.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>For a fire has gone forth from Heshbon,  </div><div class='q'>A flame from the city of Sihon,  </div><div class='q'>And has consumed as far as Moab,  </div><div class='q'>And devoured the pillars of Arnon.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>Woe to thee, Moab;  </div><div class='q'>Thou art lost, thou people of Chemosh:  </div><div class='q'>Their sons are sold for preservation,  </div><div class='q'>And their daughters are captives  </div><div class='q'>To Sihon king of the Amorites.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>And their seed shall perish <span class='add'>from</span> Heshbon to Dibon;

and they took it, and its villages, and cast out the Amorite that dwelt there.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>And having returned, they went up the road that leads to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went forth to meet them, and all his people to war to Edrei.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>And the Lord said to Moses, Fear him not; for I have delivered him and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon.   <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And he smote him and his sons, and all his people, until he left none of his to be taken alive; and they inherited his land.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
