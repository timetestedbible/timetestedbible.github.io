So he departed, and came into the country of Gilead.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>And when he came near to Baskama, he slew Jonathan, who was buried there.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Afterward Trypho returned and went into his own land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modein, the city of his fathers.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many days.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>Simon also built a monument upon the sepulcher of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewn stone behind and before.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, for his father, and his mother, and his four brethren.   <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he set great pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armor for a perpetual memory, and by the armor ships carved, that they might be seen of all that sail on the sea.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>This is the sepulcher which he made at Modein, and it standeth yet unto this day.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Now Trypho dealt deceitfully with the young King Antiochus, and slew him.   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king of Asia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Then Simon built up the strongholds in Judea, and fenced them about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars, and laid up victuals therein.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to King Demetrius, to the end he should give the land an immunity, because all that Trypho did was to spoil.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>Unto whom King Demetrius answered and wrote after this manner:   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting:   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent unto us, we have received: and we are ready to make a steadfast peace with you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm the immunities which we have granted.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand; and the strongholds, which ye have built, shall be your own.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and if there were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no more be paid.   <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel in the hundred and seventieth year.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments and contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, the governor and leader of the Jews.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>In those days Simon camped against Gaza, and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city, and battered a certain tower, and took it.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>And they that were in the engine leaped into the city; whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:   <span class="verse" id="V45">45&#160;</span>insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, and climbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.   <span class="verse" id="V46">46&#160;</span>And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness, but according to thy mercy.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V47">47&#160;</span>So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs and thanksgiving.   <span class="verse" id="V48">48&#160;</span>Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himself.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V49">49&#160;</span>They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy, nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.   <span class="verse" id="V50">50&#160;</span>Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one with them: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions;   <span class="verse" id="V51">51&#160;</span>and entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, and with viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V52">52&#160;</span>He ordained also that that day should be kept every year with gladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the tower he made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself with his company.   <span class="verse" id="V53">53&#160;</span>And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, he made him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazara.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
