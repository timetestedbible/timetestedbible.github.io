What shall I say to them?   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And God spoke to Moses, saying, I am THE BEING; and he said, Thus shall ye say to the children of Israel, THE BEING has sent me to you.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And God said again to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, The Lord God of our fathers, the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, has sent me to you: this is my name forever, and my memorial to generations of generations.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Go then and gather the elders of the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, The Lord God of our fathers has appeared to me, the God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, saying, I have surely looked upon you, and upon all the things which have happened to you in Egypt.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>And he said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of the Egyptians to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and Amorites and Perizzites, and Girgashites, and Hivites, and Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou and the elders of Israel shall go in to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and thou shalt say to him, The God of the Hebrews has called us; we will go then a journey of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to our God.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>But I know that Pharaoh king of Egypt will not let you go, save with a mighty hand;   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>and I will stretch out my hand, and smite the Egyptians with all my wonders, which I shall work among them, and after that he will send you forth.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and whenever ye shall escape, ye shall not depart empty.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>But <span class='add'>every</span> woman shall ask of her neighbor and fellow lodger, articles of gold and silver, and apparel; and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters—and spoil ye the Egyptians.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
