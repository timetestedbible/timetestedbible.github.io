and ye shall not walk in their ordinances.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Ye shall observe my judgments, and shall keep my ordinances, and shall walk in them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>So ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments, and do them; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>No man shall draw nigh to any of his near kindred to uncover their nakedness; I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, for she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife; it is thy father’s nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy sister by thy father or by thy mother, born at home or abroad, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or thy daughter’s daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; because it is thy nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of thy father’s wife; she is thy sister by the same father: thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister, for she is near akin to thy father.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, for she is near akin to thy mother.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, and thou shalt not go in to his wife; for she is thy relation.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law, for she is thy son’s wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it is thy brother’s nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shalt thou not uncover; her son’s daughter, and her daughter’s daughter, shalt thou not take, to uncover their nakedness, for they are thy kinswomen: it is impiety.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Thou shalt not take a wife in addition to her sister, as a rival, to uncover her nakedness in opposition to her, while she is yet living.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And thou shalt not go in to a woman under separation for her uncleanness, to uncover her nakedness.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And thou shalt not lie with thy neighbor’s wife, to defile thyself with her.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And thou shalt not give of thy seed to serve a ruler; and thou shalt not profane my holy name; I <span class='add'>am</span> the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>And thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is an abomination.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Neither shalt thou lie with any quadruped for copulation, to be polluted with it: neither shall a woman present herself before any quadruped to have connection with it; for it is an abomination.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for in all these things the nations are defiled, which I drive out before you,   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>and the land is polluted; and I have recompensed their iniquity to them because of it, and the land is aggrieved with them that dwell upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>And ye shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and ye shall do none of these abominations;
