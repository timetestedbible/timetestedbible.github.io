Lay <span class='add'>it</span>, I pray you, to heart.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I have loved you, saith the Lord. And ye said, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the Lord: yet I loved Jacob,   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and hated Esau, and laid waste his borders, and made his heritage as dwellings of the wilderness?   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Because one will say, Edom has been overthrown, but let us return and rebuild the desolate places; thus saith the Lord Almighty, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The borders of wickedness, and, The people against whom the Lord has set himself forever.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The Lord has been magnified upon the borders of Israel.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>A son honors <span class='add'>his</span> father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord Almighty. Ye the priests are they that despise my name: yet ye said, Wherein have we despised thy name?   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>In that ye bring to mine altar polluted bread; and ye said, Wherein have ye polluted it? In that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and that which was set thereon ye have despised.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For if ye bring a blind <span class='add'>victim</span> for sacrifices, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? and if ye bring the lame or the sick, <span class='add'>is it</span> not evil? offer it now to thy ruler, <span class='add'>and see</span> if he will receive thee, if he will accept thy person, saith the Lord Almighty.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And now entreat the face of your God, and make supplication to him. These things have been done by your hands; shall I accept you? saith the Lord Almighty.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Because even among you the doors shall be shut, and <span class='add'>one</span> will not kindle <span class='add'>the fire of</span> mine altar for nothing, I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord Almighty, and I will not accept a sacrifice at your hands.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down <span class='add'>thereof</span> my name has been glorified among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord Almighty.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted, and his meats set thereon are despised.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And ye said, These <span class='add'>services</span> are troublesome: therefore I have utterly rejected them with scorn, saith the Lord Almighty: and ye brought in torn victims, and lame, and sick: if then ye should bring an offering, shall I accept them at your hands? saith the Lord Almighty.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And cursed <span class='add'>is the man</span> who had the power, and possessed a male in his flock, and whose vow is upon him, and who sacrifices a corrupt thing to the Lord: for I am a great King, saith the Lord Almighty, and my name is glorious among the nations.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
