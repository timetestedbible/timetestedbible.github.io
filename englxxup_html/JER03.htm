Thou hast sat for them by the wayside as a deserted crow, and hast defiled the land with thy fornications and thy wickedness.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And thou didst retain many shepherds for a stumbling block to thyself: thou hadst a whore’s face, thou didst become shameless toward all.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Hast thou not called me as it were a home, and the father and guide of thy virgin time?   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Will <span class='add'>God’s anger</span> continue forever, or be preserved to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done these bad things, and hadst power <span class='add'>to do them</span>.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen what things the house of Israel has done to me? they have gone on every high mountain, and under every shady tree, and have committed fornication there.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And I said after she had committed all these acts of fornication, Turn again to me. Yet she returned not. And faithless Judah saw her faithlessness.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And I saw that (for all the sins of which she was convicted, wherein the house of Israel committed adultery, and I put her away, and gave into her hands a bill of divorcement), yet faithless Judah feared not, but went and herself also committed fornication.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And her fornication was nothing accounted of; and she committed adultery with wood and stone.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And for all these things faithless Judah turned not to me with all her heart, but falsely.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And the Lord said to me, Israel has justified himself more than faithless Judah.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Go and read these words toward the north, and thou shalt say, Return to me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not set my face against you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry with you forever.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Nevertheless, know thine iniquity, that thou hast sinned against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to strangers under every shady tree, but thou didst not hearken to my voice, saith the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Turn, ye children that have revolted, saith the Lord; for I will rule over you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you in to Zion:   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>and I will give you shepherds after my heart, and they shall certainly tend you with knowledge.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>And it shall come to pass that when ye are multiplied and increased upon the land, saith the Lord, in those days they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Holy One of Israel: it shall not come to mind; it shall not be named; neither shall it be visited; nor shall <span class='add'>this</span> be done anymore.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>In those days and at that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered to it: and they shall not walk anymore after the imaginations of their evil heart.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>In those days the house of Judah shall come together to the house of Israel, and they shall come, together, from the land of the north, and from all the countries, to the land, which I caused their fathers to inherit.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And I said, So be it, Lord, for <span class='add'>thou saidst</span>, I will set thee among children, and will give thee a choice land, the inheritance of the Almighty God of the Gentiles: and I said, Ye shall call me Father; and ye shall not turn away from me.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>But as a wife acts treacherously against her husband, so has the house of Israel dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>A voice from the lips was heard, <span class='add'>even</span> of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel: for they have dealt unrighteously in their ways, they have forgotten God their Holy One.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>Turn, ye children that are given to turning, and I will heal your bruises.  </div><div class='p'>Behold, we will be thy servants; for thou art the Lord our God.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Truly the hills and the strength of the mountains were a lying refuge: but by the Lord our God is the salvation of Israel.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>But shame has consumed the labors of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their calves, and their sons and their daughters.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>We have lain down in our shame, and our disgrace has covered us: because we and our fathers have sinned before our God, from our youth until this day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
