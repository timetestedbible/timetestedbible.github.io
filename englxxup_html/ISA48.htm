The former things I have already declared;   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>and they have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I wrought suddenly, and <span class='add'>the events</span> came to pass.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I know that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead brazen.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And I told thee of old what <span class='add'>should be</span> before it came upon thee; I made it known to thee, lest thou shouldest say, <span class='add'>My</span> idols have done <span class='add'>it</span> for me; and shouldest say, <span class='add'>My</span> graven and molten images have commanded me.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Ye have heard all this, but ye have not known: yet I have made known to thee the new things from henceforth, which are coming to pass, and thou saidst not,   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now they come to pass, and not formerly: and thou heardest not of them in former days: say not thou, Yea, I know them.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Thou hast neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened thine ears: for I knew that thou wouldest surely deal treacherously, and wouldest be called a transgressor even from the womb.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For mine own sake will I show thee my wrath, and will bring before thee my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy thee.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Behold, I have sold thee, <span class='add'>but</span> not for silver; but I have rescued thee from the furnace of affliction.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For mine own sake I will do <span class='add'>this</span> for thee, because my name is profaned; and I will not give my glory to another.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call; I am the first, and I endure forever.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>My hand also has founded the earth, and my right hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together.   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>And all shall be gathered, and shall hear: who has told them these things?
