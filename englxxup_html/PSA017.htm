 </div><div class='q'>My God is my helper, I will hope in him;  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>He is</span> my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I will call upon the Lord with praises,  </div><div class='q'>And I shall be saved from mine enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The pangs of death compassed me,  </div><div class='q'>And the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>The pangs of hell came round about me:  </div><div class='q'>The snares of death prevented me.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And cried to my God:  </div><div class='q'>He heard my voice out of his holy temple,  </div><div class='q'>And my cry shall enter before him, <span class='add'>even</span> into his ears.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then the earth shook and quaked,  </div><div class='q'>And the foundations of the mountains were disturbed,  </div><div class='q'>And were shaken, because God was angry with them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>There went up a smoke in his wrath,  </div><div class='q'>And fire burst into a flame at his presence:  </div><div class='q'>Coals were kindled at it.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And he bowed the heaven, and came down:  </div><div class='q'>And thick darkness was under his feet.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And he mounted on cherubs and flew:  </div><div class='q'>He flew on the wings of winds.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And he made darkness his secret place:  </div><div class='q'>Round about him was his tabernacle,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Even</span> dark water in the clouds of the air.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>At the brightness before him the clouds passed,  </div><div class='q'>Hail and coals of fire.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The Lord also thundered from heaven,  </div><div class='q'>And the Highest uttered his voice.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And he sent forth <span class='add'>his</span> weapons, and scattered them;
