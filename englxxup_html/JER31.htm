  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Moab has been at ease from a child, and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out <span class='add'>his liquor</span> from vessel to vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him, and his smell departed not.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Therefore, behold, his days come, saith the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their hope, having trusted in them.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>How will ye say, We are strong, and men strong for war?   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Moab is ruined, <span class='add'>even</span> his city, and his choice young men have gone down to slaughter.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>The day of Moab is near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly <span class='add'>to vengeance</span>.   <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Shake <span class='add'>the head</span> at him, all ye that are round about him; all <span class='add'>of you</span> utter his name; say ye, How is the glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence!   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Come down from <span class='add'>thy</span> glory, and sit down in a damp place: Dibon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed: there has gone up against thee one to ravage thy stronghold.   <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Stand by the way, and look, thou that dwellest in Aroer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say, What has happened?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>Moab is put to shame, because he is broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And judgment is coming against the land of Misor, upon Holon, and Jahzah, and Mephaath,   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of Beth-diblathaim,   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and upon Kiriathaim, and upon the house of Gamul, and upon the house of Meon,   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of Moab, far and near.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>Make ye him drunk; for he has magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall be also himself a laughingstock.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>For surely Israel was to thee a laughingstock, and was found among thy thefts, because thou didst fight against him.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and dwelt in rocks; they have become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And I have heard of the pride of Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has been lifted up.   <span class="verse" id="V30">30&#160;</span>But I know his works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus?   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Therefore howl ye for Moab on all sides; cry out against the shorn men <span class='add'>in</span> a gloomy place. I will weep for thee,   <span class="verse" id="V32">32&#160;</span>O vine of Aserema, as with the weeping of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they reached the cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon thy fruits, <span class='add'>and</span> upon thy grape-gatherers.   <span class="verse" id="V33">33&#160;</span>Joy and gladness have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and <span class='add'>though</span> there was wine in thy presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they raise the cry of joy.   <span class="verse" id="V34">34&#160;</span>From the cry of Heshbon even to Aetam their cities uttered their voice, from Zoar to Horonaim, and their tidings <span class='add'>as</span> a heifer of three years old, for the water also of Nimrim shall be dried up.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V35">35&#160;</span>And I will destroy Moab, saith the Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods.   <span class="verse" id="V36">36&#160;</span>Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what <span class='add'>every</span> man has gained has perished from him.   <span class="verse" id="V37">37&#160;</span>They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat <span class='add'>the breasts</span>, and on all loins shall be sackcloth.   <span class="verse" id="V38">38&#160;</span>And on all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets <span class='add'>shall be mourning</span>: for I have broken <span class='add'>him</span>, saith the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless.   <span class="verse" id="V39">39&#160;</span>How has he changed! how has Moab turned <span class='add'>his</span> back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughingstock, and an object of anger to all that are round about him.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V40">40&#160;</span>For thus said the Lord;   <span class="verse" id="V41">41&#160;</span>Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds have been taken together.   <span class="verse" id="V42">42&#160;</span>And Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself against the Lord.   <span class="verse" id="V43">43&#160;</span>A snare, and fear, and the pit, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab.   <span class="verse" id="V44">44&#160;</span>He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
