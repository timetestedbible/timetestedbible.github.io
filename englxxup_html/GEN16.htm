And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.   <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>So Sarai the wife of Abram having taken Hagar the Egyptian her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, gave her to Abram her husband as a wife to him.   <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived, and saw that she was with child, and her mistress was dishonored before her.   <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And Sarai said to Abram, I am injured by thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and when I saw that she was with child, I was dishonored before her. The Lord judge between me and thee.   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And Abram said to Sarai, Behold thy handmaid is in thy hands, use her as it may seem good to thee.
