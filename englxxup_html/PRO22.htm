 </div><div class='q'>But the Lord made them both.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>An intelligent man seeing a bad man severely punished is himself instructed,  </div><div class='q'>But fools pass by and are punished.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord is the offspring of wisdom,  </div><div class='q'>And wealth, and glory, and life.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Thistles and snares are in perverse ways;  </div><div class='q'>But he that keeps his soul will refrain from them.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The rich will rule over the poor,  </div><div class='q'>And servants will lend to their own masters.   </div><div class='b'> &#160;

 </div><div class='q'>But <span class='add'>a man</span> shall fully prove the folly of his works.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He that has pity on the poor shall himself be maintained;  </div><div class='q'>For he has given of his own bread to the poor.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">9a&#160;</span>He that gives liberally secures victory and honor;  </div><div class='q'>But he takes away the life of them that possess <span class='add'>them</span>.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Cast out a pestilent person from the council, and strife shall go out with him;
