 </div><div class='q'>And utter my voice to the sons of men.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>O ye simple, understand subtlety,  </div><div class='q'>And ye that are untaught, imbibe knowledge.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Hearken to me; for I will speak solemn <span class='add'>truths</span>;  </div><div class='q'>And will produce right <span class='add'>sayings</span> from my lips.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For my throat shall meditate truth;  </div><div class='q'>And false lips are an abomination before me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;  </div><div class='q'>There is nothing in them wrong or perverse.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They are all evident to those that understand,  </div><div class='q'>And right to those that find knowledge.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Receive instruction, and not silver;  </div><div class='q'>And knowledge rather than tried gold.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For wisdom is better than precious stones;  </div><div class='q'>And no valuable substance is of equal worth with it.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I wisdom have dwelt <span class='add'>with</span> counsel and knowledge,  </div><div class='q'>And I have called upon understanding.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>The fear of the Lord hates unrighteousness,  </div><div class='q'>And insolence, and pride, and the ways of wicked men;  </div><div class='q'>And I hate the perverse ways of bad men.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>Counsel and safety are mine:  </div><div class='q'>Prudence is mine, and strength is mine.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>By me kings reign,  </div><div class='q'>And princes decree justice.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>By me nobles become great,  </div><div class='q'>And monarchs by me rule over the earth.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I love those that love me;
