And he said, The people fled out of the battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?   <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon Mount Gilboa; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.   <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, <span class='add'>here am</span> I.   <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>And he said to me, Who art thou? and I said, I am an Amalekite.   <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life <span class='add'>is</span> in me.   <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So I stood over him and slew him, because I knew he would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And David laid hold of his garments, and rent them; and all the men who were with him rent their garments.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Judah, and for the house of Israel, because they were smitten with the sword.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence art thou?
