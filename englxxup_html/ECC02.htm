<div class='chapterlabel' id="V0"> 2</div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V1">1&#160;</span>I said in my heart,  </div><div class='q'>Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, and behold thou good:  </div><div class='q'>And, behold, this is also vanity.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>I said to laughter, Madness:  </div><div class='q'>And to mirth, Why doest thou this?   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>And I examined whether my heart  </div><div class='q'>Would excite my flesh as <span class='add'>with</span> wine  </div><div class='q'>(Though my heart guided <span class='add'>me</span> in wisdom),  </div><div class='q'>And <span class='add'>I desired</span> to lay hold of mirth,  </div><div class='q'>Until I should see of what kind is the good to the sons of men,  </div><div class='q'>Which they should do under the sun  </div><div class='q'>All the days of their life.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>I enlarged my work;  </div><div class='q'>I built me houses;  </div><div class='q'>I planted me vineyards.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>I made me gardens and orchards,  </div><div class='q'>And planted in them every kind of fruit tree.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I made me pools of water,  </div><div class='q'>To water from them the timber-bearing wood.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>I got servants and maidens,  </div><div class='q'>And servants were born to me in the house:  </div><div class='q'>Also I had abundant possession of flocks and herds,  </div><div class='q'>Beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Moreover I collected for myself both silver and gold also,  </div><div class='q'>And the peculiar treasures of kings and provinces:  </div><div class='q'>I procured me singing men and singing women,  </div><div class='q'>And delights of the sons of men,  </div><div class='q'>A butler and female cupbearers.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So I became great,  </div><div class='q'>And advanced beyond all  </div><div class='q'>That were before me in Jerusalem:  </div><div class='q'>Also my wisdom was established to me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>And whatever mine eyes desired,  </div><div class='q'>I withheld not from them,  </div><div class='q'>I withheld not my heart  </div><div class='q'>From all my mirth:  </div><div class='q'>For my heart rejoiced in all my labor;  </div><div class='q'>And this was my portion  </div><div class='q'>Of all my labor.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And I looked on all my works  </div><div class='q'>Which my hands had wrought,  </div><div class='q'>And on my labor which I labored to perform:  </div><div class='q'>And, behold, all was vanity and waywardness of spirit,  </div><div class='q'>And there is no advantage under the sun.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then I looked on to see wisdom,  </div><div class='q'>And madness, and folly:  </div><div class='q'>For who is the man who will follow after counsel,  </div><div class='q'>In all things wherein he employs it?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>And I saw that wisdom excels folly,  </div><div class='q'>As much as light excels darkness.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The wise man’s eyes are in his head;  </div><div class='q'>But the fool walks in darkness:  </div><div class='q'>And I perceived, even I,  </div><div class='q'>That one event shall happen to them all.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>And I said in my heart,  </div><div class='q'>As the event of the fool is,  </div><div class='q'>So shall it be to me, even to me;  </div><div class='q'>And to what purpose have I gained wisdom?  </div><div class='q'>I said moreover in my heart,  </div><div class='q'>This is also vanity,  </div><div class='q'>Because the fool speaks of his abundance.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>For there is no remembrance of the wise man  </div><div class='q'>With the fool forever;  </div><div class='q'>Forasmuch as now <span class='add'>in</span> the coming days  </div><div class='q'>All things are forgotten:  </div><div class='q'>And how shall the wise man die with the fool?   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So I hated life;  </div><div class='q'>Because the work that was wrought under the sun  </div><div class='q'>Was evil before me:  </div><div class='q'>For all is vanity and waywardness of spirit.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>And I hated the whole of my labor  </div><div class='q'>Which I took under the sun;  </div><div class='q'>Because I must leave it to the man who will come after me.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>And who knows whether he will be a wise <span class='add'>man</span> or a fool?  </div><div class='q'>And whether he will have power over all my labor  </div><div class='q'>In which I labored, and wherein I grew wise under the sun?  </div><div class='q'>This is also vanity.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>So I went about to dismiss from my heart  </div><div class='q'>All my labor wherein I had labored under the sun.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>For there is <span class='add'>such</span> a man that his labor  </div><div class='q'>Is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in fortitude;  </div><div class='q'>Yet <span class='add'>this</span> man shall give his portion  </div><div class='q'>To one who has not labored therein.  </div><div class='q'>This is also vanity and great evil.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>For it happens to a man in all his labor,  </div><div class='q'>And in the purpose of his heart  </div><div class='q'>Wherein he labors under the sun.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>For all his days  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Are days</span> of sorrows, and vexation of spirit is his;  </div><div class='q'>In the night also his heart rests not.  </div><div class='q'>This is also vanity.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>A man has nothing <span class='add'>really</span> good  </div><div class='q'>To eat, and to drink, and to show his soul  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>As</span> good in his trouble.  </div><div class='q'>This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>For who shall eat, or who shall drink, without him?   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>For <span class='add'>God</span> has given to the man  </div><div class='q'>Who is good in his sight,  </div><div class='q'>Wisdom, and knowledge, and joy:  </div><div class='q'>But he has given to the sinner trouble,  </div><div class='q'>To add and to heap up,  </div><div class='q'>That he may give to him that is good before God;  </div><div class='q'>For this is also vanity and waywardness of spirit.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <ul class='tnav'>
