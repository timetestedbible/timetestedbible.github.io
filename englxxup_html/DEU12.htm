and he shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye shall dwell safely.   <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>And there shall be a place which the Lord thy God shall choose for his name to be called there, thither shall ye bring all things that I order you today; your whole burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the firstfruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatsoever ye shall vow to the Lord your God.   <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants and your maidservants, and the Levite that is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you.   <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy whole burnt offerings in any place which thou shalt see;   <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>save in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, in one of thy tribes, there shall ye offer your whole burnt offerings, and there shalt thou do all things whatsoever I charge thee this day.   <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But thou shalt kill according to all thy desire, and shalt eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which he has given thee in every city; the unclean that is within thee and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the stag.   <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy cities the tithe of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the firstborn of thy herd and of thy flock, and all <span class='add'>your</span> vows as many as ye shall have vowed, and your thank offerings, and the firstfruits of thy hands.   <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>But before the Lord thy God thou shalt eat it, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the stranger that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, on whatsoever thou shalt lay thy hand.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Take heed to thyself that thou do not desert the Levite all the time that thou livest upon the earth.   <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And if the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, as he said to thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh; if thy soul should desire to eat flesh, thou shalt eat flesh according to all the desire of thy soul.   <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>And if the place be far from thee, which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, that his name be called upon it, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which God shall have given thee, even as I commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy cities according to the desire of thy soul.   <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>As the doe and the stag are eaten, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat it in like manner.   <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>Take diligent heed that thou eat no blood, for blood <span class='add'>is</span> the life of it; the life shall not be eaten with the flesh.   <span class="verse" id="V24">24&#160;</span>Ye shall not eat <span class='add'>it</span>; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water.   <span class="verse" id="V25">25&#160;</span>Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee, if thou shalt do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God.   <span class="verse" id="V26">26&#160;</span>But thou shalt take thy holy things, if thou hast any, and thy vowed offerings, and come to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name named upon it.   <span class="verse" id="V27">27&#160;</span>And thou shalt sacrifice thy whole burnt offerings, thou shalt offer the flesh upon the altar of the Lord thy God; but the blood of thy sacrifices thou shalt pour out at the foot of the altar of the Lord thy God, but the flesh thou shalt eat.   <span class="verse" id="V28">28&#160;</span>Beware and hearken, and thou shalt do all the commands which I charge thee, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons forever, if thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God.   </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V29">29&#160;</span>And if the Lord thy God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom thou goest in thither to inherit their land, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit it, and dwell in their land;

I will do likewise.   <span class="verse" id="V31">31&#160;</span>Thou shalt not do so to thy God; for they have sacrificed to their gods the abominations of the Lord which he hates, for they burn their sons and their daughters in fire to their gods.   </div><ul class='tnav'>
