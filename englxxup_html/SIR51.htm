  </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>From the choking of fire on every side,  </div><div class='q'>And from the midst of the fire which I kindled not;   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>From the depth of the belly of hell,  </div><div class='q'>From an unclean tongue, and from lying words.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue  </div><div class='q'>My soul drew near even unto death,  </div><div class='q'>My life was near to the hell beneath.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>They compassed me on every side,  </div><div class='q'>And there was no man to help me:  </div><div class='q'>I looked for the succor of men, but there was none.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord,  </div><div class='q'>And upon thy acts of old,  </div><div class='q'>How thou deliverest such as wait for thee,  </div><div class='q'>And savest them out of the hands of the enemies.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Then lifted I up my supplication from the earth,  </div><div class='q'>And prayed for deliverance from death.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord,  </div><div class='q'>That he would not leave me in the days of my trouble,  </div><div class='q'>And in the time of the proud, when there was no help.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>I will praise thy name continually,  </div><div class='q'>And will sing praise with thanksgiving;  </div><div class='q'>And so my prayer was heard:   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>For thou savedst me from destruction,  </div><div class='q'>And deliveredst me from the evil time:  </div><div class='q'>Therefore will I give thanks, and praise thee,  </div><div class='q'>And bless thy name, O Lord.   </div><div class='b'> &#160; </div> <div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When I was yet young, or ever I went abroad,  </div><div class='q'>I desired wisdom openly in my prayer.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I prayed for her before the temple,  </div><div class='q'>And will seek her out even to the end.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Even from the flower till the grape was ripe  </div><div class='q'>Hath my heart delighted in her:  </div><div class='q'>My foot went the right way,  </div><div class='q'>From my youth up sought I after her.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her,  </div><div class='q'>And got much learning.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>I profited therein,  </div><div class='q'><span class='add'>Therefore</span> will I ascribe the glory unto him that giveth me wisdom.   </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>For I purposed to do after her,  </div><div class='q'>And earnestly I followed that which is good;
