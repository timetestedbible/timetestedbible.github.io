# Solomon's Temple: Multi-Path Chronological Verification

The date of Solomon's Temple foundation (966 BC) is one of the most robustly verified dates in ancient history. Three completely independent ancient civilizations—Assyria, Babylon, and Egypt—each provide evidence chains that converge on approximately the same date.

## Why This Matters

When multiple independent sources agree, it dramatically reduces the chance of error. If the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Egyptians had no contact with each other's records (and they didn't share chronological systems), yet all point to the same timeframe for biblical events, the date is historically secure.

## Assyrian Evidence Chain

The Assyrians were meticulous record-keepers who named each year after a high official (called a "limmu"). These **Limmu Lists** provide an unbroken sequence of years.

### The Anchor: Bur-Sagale Eclipse (763 BC)

The Assyrian records note that during the limmu of Bur-Sagale, "the sun underwent an eclipse." Modern astronomy confirms exactly one total solar eclipse visible from Assyria on **June 15, 763 BC**. This gives us an absolute anchor point.

→ [[bur-sagale-eclipse]]

### Counting Forward: Battle of Qarqar (853 BC)

From the Bur-Sagale eclipse, we can count exactly **90 limmu years backwards** to the Battle of Qarqar, where Shalmaneser III fought a coalition of Levantine kings. His victory stele (the Kurkh Monolith) lists the enemy forces, including:

> "Ahab the Israelite: 2,000 chariots, 10,000 soldiers"

This is the same Ahab of 1 Kings 16-22. Ahab died around the time of this battle.

→ [[battle-of-qarqar]]
→ [[ahab-reign]]

### Another Confirmation: Jehu's Tribute (841 BC)

Twelve years after Qarqar, in Shalmaneser III's 18th year (**78 limmu years** before the eclipse), the Black Obelisk depicts "Jehu, son of Omri" kneeling before Shalmaneser and paying tribute. This is the Jehu of 2 Kings 9-10.

→ [[jehu-tribute]]
→ [[jehu-reign]]

### Counting Back to Solomon

From Ahab's death (~853 BC), we use the biblical king lists to count backwards:

- Ahab → Omri → Tibni → Zimri → Elah → Baasha → Nadab → Jeroboam I
- Jeroboam I's reign began when the kingdom divided at Solomon's death

This places Solomon's death at approximately **930 BC**. Solomon reigned 40 years (1 Kings 11:42), so his 1st year was ~970 BC, and his **4th year (Temple foundation) = 966 BC**.

## Babylonian Evidence Chain

The Babylonians were astronomers who recorded detailed celestial observations in "astronomical diaries."

### The Anchor: VAT 4956 Tablet (568 BC)

The VAT 4956 tablet (now in Berlin's Vorderasiatisches Museum) records lunar positions, planetary conjunctions, and eclipse observations for "Year 37 of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon."

Modern astronomical software can calculate exactly when these celestial configurations occurred. **They match 568/567 BC and no other year within centuries.** This is as close to an absolute date as ancient history gets.

→ [[vat-4956-observation]]
→ [[nebuchadnezzar-reign]]

### Dating the Temple Destruction (586 BC)

If Nebuchadnezzar's 37th year = 568 BC, then:
- His 1st year = 604 BC
- His **18th year = 586 BC**

Jeremiah 52:12 and 2 Kings 25:8 both state that Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Solomon's Temple in his 18th/19th year (the one-year difference is due to accession-year vs. non-accession-year counting).

→ [[temple-destruction-first]]

### Counting Back to Solomon

From the Temple destruction (586 BC), we count backwards through the kings of Judah using biblical reign lengths:

- Zedekiah (11 years) → Jehoiachin (3 months) → Jehoiakim (11 years) → Jehoahaz (3 months) → Josiah (31 years) → ... → Rehoboam (17 years) → Solomon (40 years)

The total comes to approximately **344 years** from Solomon's death to the Temple destruction.
930 BC (Solomon's death) - 586 BC (destruction) = 344 years ✓

This confirms Solomon's 4th year at approximately **966 BC**.

## Egyptian Evidence Chain

Egyptian chronology is anchored by astronomical observations (Sothic cycle, lunar dates) and extensive king lists.

### The Anchor: Shoshenq I's Campaign Relief

At the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Pharaoh **Shoshenq I** (founder of the 22nd Dynasty) carved a massive relief depicting his military campaign into Palestine. The relief lists over **150 conquered cities**, many identifiable with biblical sites in both Israel and Judah.

→ [[shoshenq-i-reign]]

### The Biblical Connection: Shishak's Invasion

1 Kings 14:25-26 records:

> "In the **fifth year of King Rehoboam**, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. He took away the treasures of the house of the LORD..."

Shoshenq = Shishak (the Hebrew spelling reflects the Egyptian name). Egyptian chronology dates Shoshenq I's Palestinian campaign to approximately **925 BC**.

→ [[shishak-invasion]]
→ [[rehoboam-reign]]

### Calculating Solomon's Date

If Rehoboam's 5th year = 925 BC, then:
- Rehoboam's 1st year (= Solomon's death) = 930 BC
- Solomon reigned 40 years, so his 1st year = 970 BC
- Solomon's **4th year = 966 BC** ✓

## Convergence = Confidence

| Evidence Chain | Anchor | Method | Result |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Assyrian** | Bur-Sagale Eclipse (763 BC) | Count via Limmu Lists to Ahab, then biblical kings | ~966 BC |
| **Babylonian** | VAT 4956 Tablet (568 BC) | Count to Temple destruction, then biblical kings | ~966 BC |
| **Egyptian** | Shoshenq I Campaign (~925 BC) | 5th year of Rehoboam → Solomon | ~966 BC |

Three independent civilizations. Three different record-keeping systems. Three different astronomical anchors. **One convergent date.**

This is why 966 BC for Solomon's Temple foundation is considered one of the most secure dates in ancient Near Eastern chronology.
