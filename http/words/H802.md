## Summary

The Hebrew word for "woman" (אִשָּׁה / *ishshah*, H802) shares identical consonants with the word for "fire offering" (אִשָּׁה / *ishshah*, H801).

## The Consonantal Identity

Without vowel points, both H801 and H802 are written:

### אשה

The Masoretic vowel pointing (added 6th-10th century AD) distinguishes:
- **H801** אִשָּׁה = "offering made by fire"
- **H802** אִשָּׁה = "woman"

The vowel points are identical — Strong's gives both as *ishshâh* (ish-shaw'). The distinction is purely contextual.

## Strong's Definitions

## Derivation Chain

Strong's explicitly traces:

1. **H784** (אֵשׁ / esh) = fire — primitive word
2. **H800** (אֶשָּׁה / eshshâh) = fire — "feminine of H784"
3. **H801** (אִשָּׁה / ishshâh) = fire offering — "the same as H800, but used in a liturgical sense"

Meanwhile:
- **H802** (אִשָּׁה / ishshâh) = woman — "feminine of H376 (man)"

Both H801 and H802 share the same spelling and pronunciation, but Strong's gives them different derivations.

## The Fire Offering (H801) in Context

The *ishshah* (H801) offering appears throughout Leviticus:

> "And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, **an offering made by fire** (אִשָּׁה) unto the LORD."  
> — Exodus 29:18

> "The priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, **an offering made by fire** (אִשָּׁה), of a sweet savour unto the LORD."  
> — Leviticus 1:9

> "It is the food of **the offering made by fire** (אִשָּׁה) unto the LORD."  
> — Leviticus 3:11

The fire offering is characterized by being **completely consumed** on the altar.

## Woman (H802) in Context

First occurrence:

> "And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a **woman** (אִשָּׁה), and brought her unto the man. And Adam said... she shall be called **Woman** (אִשָּׁה), because she was taken out of **Man** (אִישׁ)."  
> — Genesis 2:22-23

The text explicitly connects *ishshah* (woman) to *ish* (man) through a play on words.

## Verses Where "Woman" May Mean "Fire Offering"

The following verses are marked with 🔥 in the Bible reader because the context suggests "fire" or "fire offering" may be a better reading than "woman":

### Zechariah 5:7-11 — The Woman in the Ephah

> "And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a **woman** 🔥 that sitteth in the midst of the ephah."  
> — Zechariah 5:7

> "Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out **two women** 🔥, and the wind was in their wings..."  
> — Zechariah 5:9

> "...To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base."  
> — Zechariah 5:11

**Context:** A flying ephah (barrel) with a lead cover, carried to Babylon. Reading "fire offering" instead of "woman" suggests a payload of fire being transported to Shinar/Babylon — connecting to prophecies of Babylon's destruction by fire.

### Jeremiah 50:37 — Babylon's Judgment

> "A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as **women** 🔥..."  
> — Jeremiah 50:37

**Context:** A prophecy against Babylon. Reading "they shall become as fire offerings" (consumed) rather than "they shall become as women" (weak) fits the context of complete destruction.

### Nahum 3:13 — Nineveh's Fall

> "Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are **women** 🔥: the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour thy bars."  
> — Nahum 3:13

**Context:** Prophecy against Nineveh. The verse explicitly mentions fire devouring. Reading "thy people are fire offerings" (consumed) rather than "thy people are women" (weak) aligns with the fire imagery.

## The Question

Why do "woman" (H802) and "fire offering" (H801) share:
- The same consonants (אשה)
- The same vowel pointing (אִשָּׁה)
- The same pronunciation (ishshâh)

Strong's treats them as separate words with different derivations:
- H801 derives from H800/H784 (fire)
- H802 derives from H376 (man)

The text does not explain this connection explicitly. The reader is left to observe that these identical-looking words carry very different meanings distinguished only by context.
