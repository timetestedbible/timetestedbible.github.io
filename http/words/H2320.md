## Summary

The word *chodesh* (חֹדֶשׁ) derives from the verb *chadash* (חָדַשׁ, H2318) meaning "to renew, restore to completeness." Every biblical use of the verb describes restoration to a full, perfect state — not the beginning of something partial, but the restoring of something to its complete condition. Applied to the moon, *chodesh* names the lunar phase when the moon is "renewed" to its complete, full state.

## Key Verse: Psalm 81:3

> "Blow up the trumpet **ba-chodesh** (בַּחֹדֶשׁ), **ba-keseh** (בַּכֵּסֶה), for the day of our feast."

### Hebrew Parallelism

This verse uses synonymous poetic parallelism. Without an inserted "and," the text equates:
- **chodesh** (חֹדֶשׁ) = the renewed moon
- **keseh** (כֶּסֶה, H3677) = fullness

**H3677 (keseh)** derives from H3680 (kasah) meaning "to fill up hollows." Cognates in Aramaic (*kista*) and Akkadian (*kuseu*) directly mean "full moon."

The verse equates the "renewed moon" with "fullness" — both describing the same lunar event for "the day of our feast."

## Pictographic Letter Analysis

The ancient Hebrew letters that form חֹדֶשׁ:

| Letter | Paleo-Hebrew | Pictographic Meaning |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| ח (chet) | 𐤇 | Wall, fence, enclosure |
| ד (dalet) | 𐤃 | Door, gate, transition |
| ש (shin) | 𐤔 | Teeth, fire, light, whiteness |

**Combined meaning:** An enclosed light passing through a gate — a vivid picture of the full moon (an enclosed circle of shining whiteness) standing in the constellation "gate" of the heavenly tabernacle.

## Calendar Implications

### The Creation Mandate (Genesis 1:14-16)

> "God made the two **great lights**... the lesser light to govern the night **with the stars**."

For the moon to be a "great light" governing the night "with the stars":
- **Full moon:** Visible dusk to dawn, co-ruling the entire night with visible constellations
- **Crescent moon:** Vanishes quickly after sunset; cannot co-rule with stars
- **Dark moon:** Provides no light at all

### Predictability (1 Samuel 20:5, 18)

> "Behold, **tomorrow is the** chodesh, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat."

David announces with certainty, the day before, that "tomorrow is the chodesh." This advance predictability fits the full moon (easily predicted by observing the waxing progression) rather than a crescent (weather-dependent, can be delayed 1-3 days).

### The Darkness Pattern

**Abraham's Covenant (Genesis 15:12, 17):** Sealed in "great darkness" — total darkness, no moonlight.

**The Exodus (Exodus 12:40-41; Numbers 33:3):** Departure on "the selfsame day," 430 years later, on the **15th day of the first month**.

For both events to occur on naturally dark nights at mid-month (15th), the month must begin at full moon and wane toward mid-month darkness.

## Conclusion

Based on the textual evidence:

1. **The verb root (H2318)** consistently means "restore to completeness/perfection"
2. **Psalm 81:3** equates *chodesh* with *keseh* (fullness)
3. **Genesis 1:16** requires a "great light" governing the night "with the stars"
4. **The Hebrew letters** depict an enclosed, shining light in a gate
5. **1 Samuel 20** assumes advance predictability
6. **The darkness narratives** (Abraham, Exodus, Crucifixion) place mid-month at the dark phase

**H2320 (חֹדֶשׁ / chodesh) refers to the full moon** — the moment when the moon is "renewed" or "restored to its complete, perfect state."
