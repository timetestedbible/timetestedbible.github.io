# Gematria — Number Study

## What is Gematria?

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Letter-Numbers |
| **Two Words** | Alphabetic Numerology |
| **Sentence** | The ancient practice of assigning numerical values to letters, allowing words and phrases to carry quantitative significance alongside their linguistic meaning |

## The Ancient Practice

Gematria (גימטריא) derives from the Greek word *geometria* (geometry), reflecting the mathematical approach to language. In both Hebrew and Greek, letters served double duty: they were both phonetic symbols AND numerical digits. There were no separate number systems—the alphabet WAS the number system.

This wasn't mystical invention but practical necessity. Before Arabic numerals (0-9), ancient cultures used their alphabets for counting, commerce, and record-keeping.

## Hebrew Letter Values

The Hebrew alphabet assigns numerical values as follows:

| Letter | Name | Value | | Letter | Name | Value | | Letter | Name | Value |
|--------|------|-------|---|--------|------|-------|---|--------|------|-------|
| א | Aleph | 1 | | י | Yod | 10 | | ק | Qoph | 100 |
| ב | Bet | 2 | | כ | Kaph | 20 | | ר | Resh | 200 |
| ג | Gimel | 3 | | ל | Lamed | 30 | | ש | Shin | 300 |
| ד | Dalet | 4 | | מ | Mem | 40 | | ת | Tav | 400 |
| ה | He | 5 | | נ | Nun | 50 | | | | |
| ו | Vav | 6 | | ס | Samekh | 60 | | | | |
| ז | Zayin | 7 | | ע | Ayin | 70 | | | | |
| ח | Chet | 8 | | פ | Pe | 80 | | | | |
| ט | Tet | 9 | | צ | Tsade | 90 | | | | |

**Final Forms** (used at word endings):
| Letter | Name | Value |
|--------|------|-------|
| ך | Final Kaph | 500 |
| ם | Final Mem | 600 |
| ן | Final Nun | 700 |
| ף | Final Pe | 800 |
| ץ | Final Tsade | 900 |

*Note: Some traditions count final forms at their regular values (20, 40, 50, 80, 90).*

## Greek Letter Values (Isopsephy)

The Greek system, called *isopsephy* (ἰσοψηφία, "equal pebbles"), follows a similar pattern:

| Letter | Name | Value | | Letter | Name | Value | | Letter | Name | Value |
|--------|------|-------|---|--------|------|-------|---|--------|------|-------|
| Α α | Alpha | 1 | | Ι ι | Iota | 10 | | Ρ ρ | Rho | 100 |
| Β β | Beta | 2 | | Κ κ | Kappa | 20 | | Σ σ/ς | Sigma | 200 |
| Γ γ | Gamma | 3 | | Λ λ | Lambda | 30 | | Τ τ | Tau | 300 |
| Δ δ | Delta | 4 | | Μ μ | Mu | 40 | | Υ υ | Upsilon | 400 |
| Ε ε | Epsilon | 5 | | Ν ν | Nu | 50 | | Φ φ | Phi | 500 |
| Ϛ ϛ | Stigma | 6 | | Ξ ξ | Xi | 60 | | Χ χ | Chi | 600 |
| Ζ ζ | Zeta | 7 | | Ο ο | Omicron | 70 | | Ψ ψ | Psi | 700 |
| Η η | Eta | 8 | | Π π | Pi | 80 | | Ω ω | Omega | 800 |
| Θ θ | Theta | 9 | | Ϙ ϙ | Koppa | 90 | | Ͳ ͳ | Sampi | 900 |

## John's Use of Gematria: Revelation 13:18

> **Revelation 13:18** — "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding **count** (ψηφισάτω / psēphisatō) the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."

The Greek word ψηφισάτω means "to calculate with pebbles"—a direct reference to isopsephy/gematria. John explicitly invites readers to USE gematria to identify the beast.

### Key Observations:

1. **"Count the number"** — The verb implies mathematical calculation, not mystical interpretation
2. **"Number of a man"** — The result corresponds to a name/person
3. **"666"** — A specific numerical target for identification

This is the clearest biblical endorsement of gematria as an interpretive tool. John expected his audience to understand and apply this method.

## Examples of Biblical Gematria

### 1. Jesus (Ἰησοῦς) = 888

| Letter | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Ι (Iota) | 10 |
| η (Eta) | 8 |
| σ (Sigma) | 200 |
| ο (Omicron) | 70 |
| υ (Upsilon) | 400 |
| ς (Final Sigma) | 200 |
| **Total** | **888** |

888 = 8 × 111, connecting Jesus to resurrection (8) and divine unity (111 = 3 × 37).

### 2. The Beast = 666

Various names have been calculated to equal 666:

**Nero Caesar** (נרון קסר in Hebrew):
| Letter | Value |
|--------|-------|
| נ (Nun) | 50 |
| ר (Resh) | 200 |
| ו (Vav) | 6 |
| נ (Nun) | 50 |
| ק (Qoph) | 100 |
| ס (Samekh) | 60 |
| ר (Resh) | 200 |
| **Total** | **666** |

### 3. The 153 Fish (John 21:11)

Some scholars note that 153 is connected to gematria patterns:
- 153 = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 17 (triangular number of 17/victory)
- "Sons of God" (בני האלהים) = 153 in some calculations

## Gematria in Ancient Culture

### Jewish Usage (1st Century and Earlier)

- **Talmudic discussions** used gematria for textual interpretation
- **Bar Kokhba coins** employed letter-numbers for dating
- **Synagogue inscriptions** encoded meanings numerically
- **Apocalyptic literature** (like Revelation) expected readers to calculate

### Greek/Roman Usage

- **Graffiti at Pompeii**: "I love her whose number is 545"
- **Suetonius** records numerical riddles about Nero
- **Sibylline Oracles** use isopsephy extensively
- **Marketplace calculations** used letter-based arithmetic daily

---

## How John's Audience Would Have Understood

John's original readers in Asia Minor (modern Turkey) would have:

1. **Regularly encountered** letter-based numerals in commerce, dates, and inscriptions
2. **Known the practice** of encoding names as numbers (common in love poetry, political satire)
3. **Expected** apocalyptic literature to use symbolic numbers
4. **Understood** "count the number" as an invitation to calculate

The mystery wasn't the METHOD (gematria)—it was the IDENTITY (who equals 666?).

---

## Cautions and Principles

### Valid Uses:
- Understanding how ancient readers interpreted texts
- Recognizing intentional numerical patterns (like 888 for Jesus)
- Appreciating the literary/mathematical artistry of Scripture

### Cautions:
- Almost any name can be manipulated to equal any number
- Not every number in Scripture is gematria-based
- Meaning comes from CONTEXT first, numerical value second
- Speculation should be distinguished from interpretation

### Principles for Study:
1. **Primary meaning is textual** — Gematria supplements, doesn't replace, plain reading
2. **Context determines significance** — Not every number is symbolic
3. **Ancient usage matters** — Apply methods the original audience would recognize
4. **Humility is essential** — Many gematria "discoveries" are coincidence

## The Theological Point

Gematria reveals that in the biblical worldview, EVERYTHING is ordered by God—even the numerical values of words. The same God who "weighs the mountains in scales" (Isa 40:12) has woven mathematical patterns into His revelation.

Whether or not every gematria calculation carries intentional meaning, the EXISTENCE of the system reminds us:
- God is a God of order, not chaos
- Scripture rewards careful, detailed study
- The ancient world integrated faith and mathematics seamlessly

---

## Summary

**Gematria** is the ancient practice of calculating numerical values from letters—a standard feature of Hebrew and Greek writing systems. John explicitly invites this method in Revelation 13:18. While requiring caution against over-application, gematria helps us understand how ancient readers engaged with Scripture and may reveal intentional patterns (like Jesus = 888) woven into the text.
