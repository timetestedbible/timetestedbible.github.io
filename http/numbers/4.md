## The Argument

### 1. Four Directions of the Earth

> **Revelation 7:1** — "I saw **four** angels standing on the **four corners of the earth**, holding the **four winds** of the earth"

> **Matthew 24:31** — "gather together his elect from the **four winds**, from one end of heaven to the other"

> **Jeremiah 49:36** — "the **four winds** from the **four quarters** of heaven"

The earth has FOUR cardinal directions: north, south, east, west. Four represents universality—everywhere.

### 2. The Fourth Day: Creation of Lights

> **Genesis 1:14-19** — "And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven..."

On the FOURTH day, God created the sun, moon, and stars—the lights that govern the earth and mark times and seasons.

### 3. Four Rivers from Eden

> **Genesis 2:10** — "a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into **four heads**"

The river divided into FOUR rivers, watering the whole earth. Universal provision.

### 4. Four Living Creatures

> **Ezekiel 1:5-10** — "came the likeness of **four living creatures**... they had the likeness of a man... they **four** had the face of a man, and the face of a lion... an ox... an eagle"

> **Revelation 4:6-8** — "round about the throne, were **four beasts**... the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle"

FOUR creatures represent all of creation around God's throne.

### 5. Four-Fold Division of Humanity

> **Revelation 13:7** — "power was given him over all kindreds, and **tongues**, and **nations**"

Scripture often divides humanity into four categories:
- Kindreds/tribes
- Tongues/languages
- Peoples/families
- Nations

### 6. Peter's Vision: Universal Gospel

> **Acts 10:11-16** — "a great sheet knit at **four corners**, and let down to the earth"

The sheet with FOUR corners symbolized the universal inclusion of Gentiles—the Gospel going to all the earth.

## Key Occurrences

| Context | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Four corners of earth (Rev 7:1) | Universal scope |
| Four winds (Mt 24:31) | All directions |
| Fourth day creation (Gen 1:14-19) | Lights for earth |
| Four rivers (Gen 2:10) | Universal provision |
| Four living creatures (Rev 4:6) | All creation |
| Four-cornered sheet (Acts 10:11) | Universal Gospel |
| Four kingdoms (Dan 2, 7) | World empires |

## The Number of Creation/Earth

While **three** represents divine completeness (heavenly), **four** represents earthly completeness (creation). The combination yields:
- **3 + 4 = 7** (spiritual perfection: heaven + earth)
- **3 × 4 = 12** (governmental perfection: God ruling earth)

---

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **3** | Divine; 3 + 4 = 7 |
| **7** | Spiritual perfection (3 + 4) |
| **12** | Governmental perfection (3 × 4) |
| **40** | Testing (4 × 10) |

---

## Summary

**FOUR** symbolizes **UNIVERSALITY**—the created world in its entirety. It encompasses all directions (north, south, east, west), all peoples (nations, tongues, tribes, peoples), and all creation (the four living creatures). When Scripture uses four, it signals worldwide or universal scope—God's works and purposes extending to all the earth.
