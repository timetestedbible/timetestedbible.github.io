# Number Studies

## What Are Number Studies?

Number studies explore the **symbolic meaning of numbers** in Scripture. Just as words can represent concepts (symbol studies) and have lexical meanings (word studies), **numbers carry representational significance** beyond their mathematical value.

## The Basis: Numbers as an Extension of Symbol Studies

### Numbers Are Symbols

Numbers in Scripture function similarly to symbolic words:

| Study Type | Focus | Example |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **Word Study** | Lexical meaning | What does the Hebrew word *shabbath* mean? |
| **Symbol Study** | Representational meaning | What does "Sabbath" *represent* in Scripture? |
| **Number Study** | Numerical symbolism | What does the number **7** *represent* in Scripture? |

### Why Numbers Have Meaning

1. **Divine Order**: God created mathematics and uses numbers purposefully
   > "He counts the number of the stars; He calls them all by name." (Psalm 147:4)

2. **Pattern Recognition**: Scripture reveals consistent patterns
   - **7** = completion, perfection, divine rest
   - **40** = testing, trial, preparation
   - **12** = divine government, foundation

3. **Gematria**: In Hebrew and Greek, letters ARE numbers
   - The alphabet served as the number system
   - Words have numerical values
   - Numbers can encode names and concepts

4. **Typological Patterns**: Numbers connect events across time
   - **40 days** of rain → **40 years** in wilderness → **40 days** of temptation
   - **7 days** of creation → **7th day** Sabbath → **7th millennium** rest

## How Number Studies Work

### 1. Scriptural Patterns

Number studies examine how a number is used throughout Scripture:

- **Frequency**: How often does the number appear?
- **Context**: What events or concepts is it associated with?
- **Patterns**: Does it consistently represent the same idea?

### 2. Mathematical Relationships

Numbers relate to each other:

- **Multiplication**: 7 × 10 = 70 (completion × testing)
- **Addition**: 6 + 6 + 6 = 666 (man attempting divinity)
- **Factors**: 12 = 3 × 4 (divine completeness × creation)

### 3. Gematria Connections

The numerical value of words reveals connections:

- **Jesus** (Ἰησοῦς) = **888** (resurrection life)
- **Beast** = **666** (man's rebellion)
- Words with the same gematria value may share meaning

## Examples of Number Symbolism

### 7 — Completion/Perfection

- **7 days** of creation
- **7th day** Sabbath
- **7 churches** in Revelation
- **7 seals, trumpets, bowls**
- **70 weeks** (7 × 10) of Daniel

**Meaning**: Divine completion, perfection, rest

### 40 — Testing/Trial

- **40 days** of rain (Noah)
- **40 years** in wilderness (Israel)
- **40 days** of temptation (Jesus)
- **40 days** before ascension

**Meaning**: Period of testing, trial, or preparation

### 666 — Man's Rebellion

- The **number of the beast**
- **6** (man) tripled
- Man attempting to be God
- Counterfeit trinity

**Meaning**: Ultimate human rebellion against God

## Relationship to Other Study Types

### Number Studies vs. Symbol Studies

- **Symbol Studies**: What does a *word* represent? (e.g., "LIGHT" = God's standard)
- **Number Studies**: What does a *number* represent? (e.g., "7" = completion)

Both ask "what does this represent?" but focus on different types of symbols.

### Number Studies vs. Word Studies

- **Word Studies**: Lexical/etymological analysis (e.g., what does *shabbath* mean linguistically?)
- **Number Studies**: Symbolic meaning (e.g., what does the number 7 represent?)

## Principles for Number Studies

### 1. Context First

Numbers derive meaning from their **scriptural context**, not arbitrary assignment.

### 2. Consistency Matters

A number's meaning should be **consistent** across Scripture, not forced to fit a theory.

### 3. Patterns Over Coincidence

Look for **repeated patterns** rather than isolated occurrences.

### 4. Avoid Speculation

Not every number is symbolic. Some numbers are simply **quantities** without deeper meaning.

### 5. Scripture Interprets Scripture

Use Scripture to understand Scripture. Compare how the same number is used in different contexts.

## How to Use Number Studies

1. **Start with Scripture**: Look for how a number is used throughout the Bible
2. **Identify Patterns**: Does it consistently appear in similar contexts?
3. **Compare with Related Numbers**: How does it relate to other significant numbers?
4. **Check Gematria**: Does the number connect to meaningful words?
5. **Test Against Scripture**: Does the proposed meaning align with biblical teaching?
