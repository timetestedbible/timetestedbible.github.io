# 71 — Number Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Judgment |
| **Two Words** | Supreme Council |

**Opposite**: Unauthorized / Without quorum / No jurisdiction

## The Argument

### 1. The Great Sanhedrin: Seventy Plus One

The Great Sanhedrin (supreme Jewish court) consisted of **71 members**:
- 70 elders (based on Numbers 11:16)
- 1 presiding high priest/leader (Nasi)

This was the highest judicial and religious authority in Israel, the court that could try capital cases and interpret the law.

### 2. Seventy Elders Plus Moses

> **Numbers 11:16-17** — "Gather unto me **seventy men** of the elders of Israel... and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them"

Moses + 70 elders = **71** total. Moses presided over the seventy, forming the prototype of the Sanhedrin structure.

### 3. The Structure of Authority

| Component | Number | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Elders | 70 | Judges/counselors |
| Presiding leader | 1 | Chief authority |
| **Total** | **71** | Complete council |

Seventy-one represents COMPLETE JUDICIAL AUTHORITY—eldership (70) with headship (1).

### 4. Mathematical Significance

**71 = 70 + 1 = Eldership + Unity/Headship**

Seventy represents complete eldership and rule. Adding one signifies the head—the presiding authority that unifies and leads the council.

### 5. The Court That Judged Christ

The Sanhedrin of 71 members was the body that tried Jesus:

> **Matthew 26:59** — "Now the chief priests, and elders, and **all the council**, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death"

> **Mark 14:55** — "the chief priests and **all the council** sought for witness against Jesus"

The full 71-member council sat in judgment—though their judgment was unjust.

### 6. Binding Decisions

The Sanhedrin's decisions were considered binding on Israel. They could:
- Interpret Torah
- Try capital cases
- Declare war
- Expand Jerusalem/Temple
- Judge prophets and kings

71 = the number of AUTHORITATIVE JUDGMENT.

## Key Occurrences

| Context | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Great Sanhedrin | 71 members (70 + 1) |
| Moses + 70 elders (Num 11:16) | 71 total leaders |
| Council that tried Jesus | Full Sanhedrin |
| 71 = 70 + 1 | Eldership + headship |

---

## The Sanhedrin Structure

| Role | Count |
|------|-------|
| Nasi (President) | 1 |
| Av Beit Din (Vice President) | 1 |
| Other members | 69 |
| **Total** | **71** |

The 71-member court required a quorum of 23 for capital cases, but the full 71 represented complete judicial authority.

---

## Seventy vs. Seventy-One

| 70 | 71 |
|----|-----|
| Eldership/counsel | Eldership + headship |
| The body | The body with its head |
| Incomplete authority | Complete authority |
| Advisors | Binding court |

Seventy alone is counsel; seventy-one is COURT—with power to render judgment.

## The Judgment Connection

| Element | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| Supreme court | Final appeals |
| Capital authority | Life and death decisions |
| Religious interpretation | Binding rulings |
| Prophetic evaluation | Testing prophets |

71 represents the seat of judgment—where ultimate decisions are made.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **70** | Eldership; 71 = 70 + 1 |
| **1** | Unity/headship; 71 = 70 + 1 |
| **12** | Government; Sanhedrin judged the 12 tribes |
| **23** | Small Sanhedrin (quorum for capital cases) |

---

## Summary

**SEVENTY-ONE** symbolizes **AUTHORITATIVE JUDGMENT**—the complete council with power to render binding decisions. The Great Sanhedrin had 71 members: 70 elders plus 1 presiding leader, mirroring Moses with the seventy. This was the supreme court of Israel, the body that tried Jesus, and the seat of judicial and religious authority. Seventy-one is eldership (70) with headship (1)—complete ruling authority.
