## The Argument

### 1. Forty Days of Rain: Flood Testing

> **Genesis 7:4** — "For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth **forty days and forty nights**"

> **Genesis 7:12** — "the rain was upon the earth **forty days and forty nights**"

The world was tested by FORTY days of flood—a complete judgment on sin.

### 2. Moses: Three Periods of Forty Years

> **Acts 7:23** — "when he was full **forty years** old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren"

> **Acts 7:30** — "when **forty years** were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness... an angel"

> **Deuteronomy 34:7** — "Moses was an hundred and **twenty years** old when he died"

Moses' 120 years = 3 × 40:
- 40 years in Egypt (preparation)
- 40 years in Midian (testing)
- 40 years leading Israel (ministry)

### 3. Moses on Sinai: Forty Days

> **Exodus 24:18** — "Moses was in the mount **forty days and forty nights**"

### 4. Israel's Wilderness: Forty Years

> **Numbers 14:33-34** — "your children shall wander in the wilderness **forty years**... After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even **forty days**, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even **forty years**"

> **Deuteronomy 8:2** — "the LORD thy God led thee these **forty years** in the wilderness, **to humble thee, and to prove thee**, to know what was in thine heart"

FORTY years of testing to prove Israel's faith.

### 5. Jesus' Temptation: Forty Days

> **Matthew 4:1-2** — "Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted **forty days and forty nights**, he was afterward an hungred"

> **Mark 1:13** — "he was there in the wilderness **forty days**, tempted of Satan"

Jesus endured FORTY days of testing—and passed where Israel failed.

### 6. Spies in Canaan: Forty Days

> **Numbers 13:25** — "they returned from searching of the land after **forty days**"

The spies explored the land FORTY days. Their report tested Israel's faith.

### 7. Elijah's Journey: Forty Days

> **1 Kings 19:8** — "he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat **forty days and forty nights** unto Horeb the mount of God"

Elijah traveled FORTY days to Horeb for his encounter with God.

### 8. Nineveh's Probation: Forty Days
