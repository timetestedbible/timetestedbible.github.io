## The Argument

### 1. Jesus Began Ministry at Thirty

> **Luke 3:23** — "And Jesus himself began to be about **thirty years** of age, when he began his ministry"

Jesus began public ministry at THIRTY—the appointed age for consecrated service.

### 2. Priests Began at Thirty

> **Numbers 4:3** — "From **thirty years** old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation"

Levites entered full priestly service at THIRTY—mature, prepared, ready for holy work.

### 3. Joseph at Thirty

> **Genesis 41:46** — "Joseph was **thirty years** old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt"

Joseph began his governmental ministry at THIRTY—after years of preparation through suffering.

### 4. David Became King at Thirty

> **2 Samuel 5:4** — "David was **thirty years** old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years"

David began ruling at THIRTY—the age of kingly maturity.

### 5. The Price of Betrayal

> **Matthew 26:15** — "What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for **thirty pieces of silver**"

> **Zechariah 11:12-13** — "So they weighed for my price **thirty pieces of silver**. And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prised at of them"

THIRTY pieces of silver—the price of a slave (Ex 21:32), the value placed on the Messiah. Ministry sold for thirty.

## Mathematical Significance

**30 = 3 × 10 = Divine × Order**
**30 = 5 × 6 = Grace × Man**

Divine completeness (3) times ordinal fullness (10) = readiness for ministry. Grace (5) applied to man (6) = equipped service.

| Person | Role | Reference |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Joseph | Governor | Gen 41:46 |
| David | King | 2 Sam 5:4 |
| Jesus | Messiah | Lk 3:23 |

All three prefigure or fulfill the ultimate ministry—Christ's.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **3** | Divine; 30 = 3 × 10 |
| **10** | Order; 30 = 3 × 10 |
| **33** | Death/completion (30 + 3) |
| **50** | End of service (30-50 = 20 years) |

## Summary

**THIRTY** symbolizes **DEDICATED MINISTRY**—the age of maturity for consecrated service. Jesus, Joseph, David, and Levitical priests all began their calling at thirty. It represents preparation complete, commission received, and public service beginning. Thirty pieces of silver—the slave's price—became the cost of betraying this ministry.
