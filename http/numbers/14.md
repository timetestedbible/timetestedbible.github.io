## The Argument

### 1. Passover: The Fourteenth Day

> **Exodus 12:6** — "ye shall keep it up until the **fourteenth day** of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening"

> **Leviticus 23:5** — "In the **fourteenth** day of the first month at even is the LORD's passover"

The Passover lamb was slain on the FOURTEENTH of Nisan—Israel's deliverance from Egypt.

### 2. Double Seven: Perfection Intensified

**14 = 7 × 2 = Perfection × Witness**

Seven represents spiritual perfection. Doubled (7 + 7 or 7 × 2), it signifies:
- Confirmed perfection
- Witnessed completion
- Deliverance accomplished

### 3. Jesus' Genealogy: Three Sets of Fourteen

> **Matthew 1:17** — "So all the generations from Abraham to David are **fourteen generations**; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are **fourteen generations**; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are **fourteen generations**"

Matthew structures Jesus' genealogy in THREE sets of FOURTEEN (42 total):
- Abraham to David: 14
- David to Babylon: 14
- Babylon to Christ: 14

The Deliverer comes through 3 × 14 = 42 generations.

### 4. Shipwreck Deliverance

> **Acts 27:27, 33** — "when the **fourteenth night** was come... while the **day was coming on**, Paul besought them all to take meat"

> **Acts 27:44** — "they escaped all safe to land"

Deliverance from shipwreck came on the FOURTEENTH night.

### 5. Purim: The Fourteenth and Fifteenth

> **Esther 9:17-19** — The Jews celebrated deliverance from Haman on the 14th and 15th of Adar

FOURTEEN marks deliverance; fifteen marks rest/celebration.
