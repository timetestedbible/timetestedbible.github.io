## The Argument

### 1. The Command to Multiply

After the flood, Noah received the command:

> **Genesis 9:1** — "And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, **Be fruitful, and multiply**, and replenish the earth"

This echoes Genesis 1:28—the mandate for offspring. Thirty-one connects to the theme of God's family multiplying.

### 2. Abraham's Household Bore Fruit

> **Genesis 14:14** — Abraham had 318 trained servants "born in his own house"

> **Genesis 20:17** — "God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children"

Abraham's house was fruitful—the father of many nations (Gen 17:5).

### 3. "Children" in Matthew's Gospel

The word "children" (in various forms) appears **thirty-one times** in Matthew's Gospel, emphasizing:
- Children of the kingdom (Mt 8:12; 13:38)
- Children of Abraham (Mt 3:9)
- Children of God (Mt 5:9)
- Becoming like children (Mt 18:3)

### 4. Proverbs 31: The Virtuous Family

Proverbs 31 contains exactly **31 verses**, describing:
- The virtuous woman
- Her children rise up and call her blessed (Prov 31:28)
- Her household's prosperity

The number matches the theme of blessed family/offspring.

### 5. Unity in One Family

**31 = 30 + 1 = Ministry + Unity**

Thirty represents dedicated service. Adding one emphasizes the UNITY of the family—one household, one Father, one family of God.
