## The Argument

### 1. The Year of Jubilee

> **Leviticus 25:10-11** — "And ye shall hallow the **fiftieth year**, and proclaim **liberty** throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a **jubile** unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. A **jubile** shall that **fiftieth year** be unto you"

The FIFTIETH year = JUBILEE:
- Debts cancelled
- Slaves freed
- Land returned
- Restoration complete

### 2. Pentecost: The Fiftieth Day

> **Leviticus 23:16** — "Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number **fifty days**"

> **Acts 2:1-4** — "And when the day of **Pentecost** was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place... they were all filled with the **Holy Ghost**"

The word "Pentecost" means "fiftieth." On the FIFTIETH day after Firstfruits, the Holy Spirit was poured out—spiritual Jubilee, freedom from bondage to sin.

### 3. Grace Times Order

**Fifty = Five (grace) × Ten (divine order)**

Grace multiplied by complete order = FREEDOM. When grace fully operates within God's order, liberty results.

### 4. Fire and Elijah

> **2 Kings 1:10-12** — Fire consumed two groups of **fifty** soldiers sent against Elijah

> **2 Kings 2:7** — "**Fifty men** of the sons of the prophets" watched Elijah's translation

Fire and fifty connect—the Spirit came at Pentecost as tongues of FIRE (Acts 2:3).

### 5. Fifty Loops and Clasps

> **Exodus 26:5-6** — "**Fifty loops**... **fifty taches** [clasps] of gold, and couple the curtains together"

FIFTY loops joined the Tabernacle curtains—unity and completeness in God's dwelling.
