# 6 — Number Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Man |
| **Two Words** | Human Imperfection |
| **Sentence** | The number of man and human effort apart from God—representing labor, incompleteness, and the limitations of humanity falling short of divine perfection (7) |

**Opposite**: Divine perfection (7) / Rest / Completion

## The Argument

### 1. Man Created on the Sixth Day

> **Genesis 1:26-31** — "And God said, Let us make **man** in our image... So God created man... And the evening and the morning were the **sixth day**"

Man was created on the SIXTH day. Six is fundamentally the number of humanity.

### 2. Six Days of Labor

> **Exodus 20:9** — "**Six days** shalt thou labour, and do all thy work"

> **Exodus 31:15** — "**Six days** may work be done"

Man works SIX days—then rests on the seventh. Six represents human labor and effort, always falling short of the rest of the seventh.

### 3. 666: The Number of the Beast

> **Revelation 13:18** — "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a **man**; and his number is **Six hundred threescore and six** (666)"

666 = 6 × 100 + 6 × 10 + 6—the ultimate expression of human effort and rebellion apart from God. Three sixes: man trying to be complete without reaching seven.

### 4. Six Water Pots at Cana

> **John 2:6** — "there were set there **six waterpots** of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews"

SIX pots of Jewish purification rituals—human religious effort. Jesus transformed them into wine (joy, blessing), showing grace completing what human effort could not.

### 5. Goliath's Six

> **1 Samuel 17:4-7** — Goliath was "**six** cubits and a span" tall, with a spear head weighing "**six hundred** shekels of iron"

The champion of human might is measured in SIXES—and defeated by David with five stones (grace).

### 6. Six Falls Short of Seven

Six is always ONE SHORT of seven (perfection/completion). This is its essence:
- Six days of labor → needs the seventh for rest
- Man's effort → needs God's completion
- 666 → parody of divine perfection

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **5** | Grace; 5 + 1 = 6 (grace given to man) |
| **7** | Perfection; 6 + 1 = 7 (man + God = complete) |
| **12** | Government; 6 × 2 = 12 (witnessed humanity) |
| **666** | Ultimate human rebellion (6 × 3) |

---

## Summary

**SIX** symbolizes **MAN**—humanity in its limitation and effort apart from God. Created on the sixth day, laboring six days, man is always one short of seven's perfection. The number 666 represents the ultimate expression of human rebellion, exalting man in place of God. Six is incomplete without the seventh.
