## The Argument

### 1. The Pre-Flood Limit

> **Genesis 6:3** — "And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be **an hundred and twenty years**"

God set ONE HUNDRED TWENTY years as the limit—whether for human lifespan or the time until the flood. This is the first occurrence: a divine boundary.

### 2. Moses' Complete Life

> **Deuteronomy 34:7** — "And Moses was **an hundred and twenty years** old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated"

Moses lived exactly 120 years—three periods of forty:
- 40 years in Egypt (education)
- 40 years in Midian (testing)
- 40 years leading Israel (ministry)

A complete, divinely bounded life.

### 3. One Hundred Twenty Disciples at Pentecost

> **Acts 1:15** — "the number of names together were about **an hundred and twenty**"

ONE HUNDRED TWENTY disciples awaited Pentecost. This was the complete company ready for the Spirit's outpouring—the full measure of the waiting church.

### 4. Mathematical Significance

**120 = 3 × 40** — Three complete periods of testing
**120 = 10 × 12** — Complete order (10) × governmental perfection (12)
**120 = 5 × 24** — Grace (5) × intensified priesthood (24)

Multiple factors converge at 120, making it a number of comprehensive completion.

### 5. Solomon's Trumpeters

> **2 Chronicles 5:12** — "an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets"

ONE HUNDRED TWENTY priests blew trumpets at the Temple dedication—the full company of praise as God's glory filled the house.

### 6. One Hundred Twenty Satraps

> **Daniel 6:1** — "It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom **an hundred and twenty** princes"

The complete governmental structure of the Medo-Persian empire: 120 satraps.

| First 40 | Preparation/Education |
| Second 40 | Testing/Humbling |

After 120, something new begins—the flood came, Moses died, Pentecost arrived.

## Summary

**ONE HUNDRED TWENTY** symbolizes **DIVINE LIMIT AND COMPLETE PROBATION**—the fullness of waiting, testing, and preparation. God gave 120 years before the flood. Moses lived 120 years. One hundred twenty disciples waited for Pentecost. As 3 × 40, it represents three complete testing periods. When 120 is reached, the probation ends and God acts.
