## The Argument

### 1. Five Loaves Feed Five Thousand

> **Matthew 14:17-21** — "We have here but **five** loaves, and two fishes... And they that had eaten were about **five thousand** men"

Jesus took the insufficient (FIVE loaves) and multiplied by grace to feed FIVE thousand. Human inadequacy met by divine sufficiency.

### 2. Abram's Covenant: Five Animals

> **Genesis 15:9** — "Take me an heifer of **three years old**, and a she goat of **three years old**, and a ram of **three years old**, and a **turtledove**, and a young **pigeon**"

FIVE animals for the covenant of grace with Abram—three large animals plus two birds = 5.

### 3. The Tabernacle's Fives

The Tabernacle, representing God's dwelling with man (grace), is measured in fives:

| Element | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| Curtain dimensions | 5 × 4 cubits (Ex 26:2) |
| Curtain sets | 5 + 5 curtains (Ex 26:3) |
| Bars per side | 5 bars (Ex 26:26-27) |
| Altar height | 5 cubits (Ex 27:1) |
| Court pillars | 5 cubits apart |
| Pillars at door | 5 pillars (Ex 26:37) |

### 4. Five Wounds of Christ

Tradition and Scripture indicate Christ bore FIVE wounds on the cross:
- Two hands
- Two feet  
- Side pierced

His wounds are the source of grace: "by whose stripes ye were healed" (1 Pet 2:24).

### 5. Five Ministry Gifts

> **Ephesians 4:11** — "And he gave some, **apostles**; and some, **prophets**; and some, **evangelists**; and some, **pastors** and **teachers**"

FIVE ministry gifts given by grace to equip the Church.

### 6. Grace Overcomes Weakness

> **Ephesians 2:8-9** — "For by **grace** are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works"

> **2 Corinthians 12:9** — "My **grace** is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness"

Grace is God's provision for human inadequacy—the essence of FIVE.

### 7. David's Five Smooth Stones

> **1 Samuel 17:40** — "chose him **five smooth stones** out of the brook"

David, representing God's anointed, took FIVE stones against Goliath. Grace triumphs over human strength.
