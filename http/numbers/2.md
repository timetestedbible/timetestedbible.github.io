# 2 — Number Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Witness |
| **Two Words** | Confirmed Testimony |
| **Sentence** | The establishment of truth through dual testimony, and the division or contrast inherent in creation—representing witness, union, and the separation of opposites |

**Opposite**: Unconfirmed / Single testimony / Unverified

---

## The Argument

### 1. Two Witnesses Establish Truth

> **Deuteronomy 19:15** — "at the mouth of **two witnesses**, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established"

> **Matthew 18:16** — "in the mouth of **two or three witnesses** every word may be established"

> **John 8:17-18** — "It is also written in your law, that the testimony of **two men** is true. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me"

The legal principle: TWO witnesses confirm and establish truth.

### 2. Division in Creation

> **Genesis 1:3-4** — "God divided the **light from the darkness**"

> **Genesis 1:6-7** — "Let there be a firmament... and let it **divide** the waters from the waters"

Creation involves separation into TWO: light/darkness, waters above/below, day/night.

### 3. Sent in Pairs

| Reference | The Pair |
|-----------|----------|
| Mark 6:7 | Jesus sent the Twelve "**two by two**" |
| Luke 10:1 | Jesus sent the Seventy "**two and two**" |
| Ecclesiastes 4:9-10 | "**Two** are better than one... if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow" |
| Acts 13:2 | Barnabas and Saul sent together |

Ministry is confirmed by pairs.

### 4. The Two Paths

> **Matthew 7:13-14** — "**two** gates... **two** ways"—broad leading to destruction, narrow leading to life

Life presents TWO fundamental choices.

### 5. Union: Two Become One

> **Genesis 2:24** — "they shall be **one** flesh" (two becoming one)

> **Ephesians 5:31-32** — "they **two** shall be one flesh... concerning Christ and the church"

> **2 Corinthians 11:2** — "I have espoused you to **one** husband"

Marriage: TWO united into ONE. Christ and the Church: TWO united.

### 6. Double Portion

> **2 Kings 2:9** — Elisha asked for "a **double portion** of thy spirit"

> **Isaiah 40:2** — "she hath received of the LORD's hand **double** for all her sins"

Double = confirmed, established, complete.

## The Division and Unity Paradox

Two represents BOTH:
- **Division**: Separation of opposites (light/dark, spirit/flesh)
- **Unity**: Two coming together as witness or in union

This reflects the biblical pattern: division is necessary for proper union. Light must be separated from darkness before it can illuminate.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **1** | Unity from which two divides |
| **3** | Divine completeness (two + one) |
| **4** | Universal witness (2 × 2) |

---

## Summary

**TWO** symbolizes **WITNESS**—the confirmation of truth through dual testimony. It also represents the division inherent in creation (separating opposites) and the union of two becoming one (marriage, Christ and Church). Every matter is established by two witnesses.
