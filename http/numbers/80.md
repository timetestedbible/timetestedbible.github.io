## The Argument

### 1. Moses at Eighty: Beginning of Ministry

> **Exodus 7:7** — "And Moses was **fourscore years** old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh"

Moses began his great ministry at EIGHTY. After 40 years in Egypt and 40 years in Midian (double testing), he was ready for the work of deliverance.

### 2. Double Forty: Completed Testing

**Eighty = 40 × 2 = Testing × Witness**

Forty represents testing/probation. Eighty is double—complete, witnessed, confirmed testing:
- Moses: 40 years Egypt + 40 years Midian = 80 years of preparation
- Then 40 years of ministry = 120 total

### 3. Strength in Psalm 90

> **Psalm 90:10** — "The days of our years are threescore years and ten (70); and if by reason of **strength** they be fourscore years (80), yet is their strength labour and sorrow"

EIGHTY is associated with STRENGTH—the extended life granted to those who endure.

### 4. Ehud's Deliverance

> **Judges 3:15-30** — Ehud delivered Israel, resulting in "**fourscore years**" of rest

After Ehud's victory, the land had EIGHTY years of peace—double the normal 40-year period.

### 5. The Letter Pey (פ) = 80

In Hebrew gematria, the letter Pey (פ) = 80. Pey means "mouth"—connecting eighty to:
- Prayer (mouth speaking to God)
- Proclamation (mouth declaring truth)
- Power through speech

Moses, whose mouth God used ("I will be with thy mouth" - Ex 4:12), began his ministry at 80.

| **10** | Order; 80 = 8 × 10 |
| **70** | Lifespan; 80 = strength beyond 70 |
| **120** | Complete life; 120 = 80 + 40 |

## Summary

**EIGHTY** symbolizes **STRENGTH THROUGH TESTING**—the power that emerges after extended probation. Moses at eighty was ready to confront Pharaoh. As 40 × 2, eighty represents double testing—completely proven, witnessed endurance. It is the number of mature prayer, powerful proclamation, and ministry born from decades of preparation.
