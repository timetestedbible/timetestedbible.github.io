## The Argument

### 1. Twenty-Four Courses of Priests

> **1 Chronicles 24:1-18** — David organized the priests into TWENTY-FOUR courses (divisions) for Temple service

The complete priestly order = 24 divisions, ensuring continual worship and service before God.

### 2. Twenty-Four Elders Around the Throne

> **Revelation 4:4** — "round about the throne were four and **twenty** seats: and upon the seats I saw four and **twenty elders** sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold"

> **Revelation 5:8** — "the four and **twenty elders** fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints"

TWENTY-FOUR elders surround God's throne in continuous worship—heavenly priesthood.

### 3. Twelve Times Two: Doubled Government

**24 = 12 × 2 = Government × Witness**

- 12 tribes (Old Covenant priesthood)
- 12 apostles (New Covenant foundation)
- 24 = complete witnessed priesthood (OT + NT unified)

### 4. Twenty-Four Courses of Singers

> **1 Chronicles 25:1-31** — David also organized TWENTY-FOUR courses of musicians/singers

Complete worship order: 24 priestly divisions + 24 musical divisions.

### 5. The Elders' Worship

> **Revelation 4:10-11** — "The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne"

> **Revelation 11:16** — "the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God"

The 24 elders model true priestly worship—falling before God, casting crowns, interceding.
