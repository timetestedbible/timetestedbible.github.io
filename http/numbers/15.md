## The Argument

### 1. The Fifteenth Day: Feast Beginnings

> **Leviticus 23:6** — "And on the **fifteenth** day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD"

> **Leviticus 23:34** — "The **fifteenth** day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for seven days"

Two major feasts begin on the FIFTEENTH:
- Unleavened Bread (15th of 1st month)
- Tabernacles (15th of 7th month)

Both are celebrations of REST after deliverance (Passover on 14th precedes Unleavened Bread).

### 2. Fifteen = Grace Plus Divine

**15 = 5 (grace) × 3 (divine)**

Grace multiplied by divine completeness = REST. When God's grace fully operates, rest results.

### 3. The Ark Rested Fifteen Cubits Above

> **Genesis 7:20** — "**Fifteen** cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered"

> **Genesis 8:4** — "the ark rested... upon the mountains of Ararat"

The floodwaters rose FIFTEEN cubits above the mountains—and the ark rested. Fifteen marks the point of rest in judgment.

### 4. Hezekiah's Fifteen Years

> **2 Kings 20:6** — "I will add unto thy days **fifteen years**"

> **Isaiah 38:5** — "I will add unto thy days **fifteen years**"

God gave Hezekiah FIFTEEN years of extended life—a period of gracious rest from death's door.

### 5. Steps of Ascent

The Psalms of Ascent (Psalms 120-134) number FIFTEEN—songs of ascending to rest in God's presence at the Temple.

## The 14-15 Pattern

| Day 14 | Day 15 |
|--------|--------|
| Passover (deliverance) | Unleavened Bread (rest) |
| Work completed | Celebration begins |
| Redemption | Rest in redemption |

FIFTEEN follows FOURTEEN as rest follows deliverance.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **5** | Grace; 15 = 5 × 3 |
| **3** | Divine; 15 = 5 × 3 |
| **14** | Deliverance; 15 = 14 + 1 (rest after) |
| **7** | Perfection; 15 = 7 + 8 (perfection + new beginning) |

---

## Summary

**FIFTEEN** symbolizes **REST**—the peace that follows deliverance. Both Unleavened Bread and Tabernacles begin on the fifteenth, celebrating rest after Passover redemption. As 5 × 3, it combines grace with divine completeness. Fifteen is the number of gracious rest—entering the blessing after the work is done.
