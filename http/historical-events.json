      "description": "On the 15th day of the 1st month, exactly 430 years to the day before the Exodus from Egypt, God makes a covenant with Abraham (then Abram) in a dark night. Genesis 15:12-17 records: 'And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him... And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.' The emphasis on total darkness\u2014'horror of great darkness' and 'it was dark'\u2014suggests a dark moon (no lunar light), which aligns with the 15th being naturally dark if the month starts at full moon (waning to dark mid-month). The covenant is sealed as God passes between the pieces of the sacrifice, confirming the promise that Abraham's seed would inherit the land. Exodus 12:40-41 explicitly connects this event to the Exodus: 'Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, [was] four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.' Galatians 3:17 confirms: 'And this I say, [that] the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.' This establishes the covenant as occurring on the 'selfsame day' 430 years before the Exodus\u2014both events occurring on the 15th of the 1st month in total darkness, providing evidence for a full moon calendar where mid-month (15th) is naturally dark.",

Aaron creates a golden calf, builds an altar before it, and proclaims: 'Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD' (Exodus 32:5). The Hebrew word for 'feast' here is chag (\u05d7\u05b7\u05d2), denoting a pilgrimage festival or appointed time (moed). The following day involves offerings, eating, drinking, and revelry\u2014elements consistent with biblical harvest feasts where wine plays a central role. When Moses descends from the mountain, the Septuagint records him saying: 'It is not the voice of them that begin the battle, nor the voice of them that begin of defeat, but the voice of them that begin of wine do I hear' (Exodus 32:18 LXX). This 'beginning with wine' marks the appointed time for accessing and celebrating the fresh produce of the vine\u2014the First Fruits of Wine. Moses shatters the tablets, grinds the golden calf to powder, and about 3000 men die as judgment. This event establishes the New Wine Feast as a biblical appointed time (moed) on the 9th of Av, which is 7 complete Sabbath weeks after Shavuot (16th of 3rd month). The timeline of Exodus shows the Golden Calf incident occurred at least 50 days after Israel arrived at Mount Sinai on the 3rd day of the 3rd month, aligning perfectly with the 9th day of the 5th month.",

Joshua prayed: 'Sun, stand still at Gibeon, and you, moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.' This was a natural celestial alignment where the sun and moon appeared in opposition (full moon phase, ~90-99% illuminated), both visible simultaneously during daylight\u2014interpreted in ANE omen practices as celestial bodies 'standing still' or 'being silent' (Hebrew damam), a divine sign. The biblical geometry precisely describes the locations: From Upper Beth Horon (observer: 31.87722\u00b0N, 35.11861\u00b0E), Gibeon (31.84750\u00b0N, 35.18639\u00b0E) was at ~118\u00b0 azimuth (sun high in sky at dawn), while Aijalon (31.84028\u00b0N, 35.02250\u00b0E) was at ~296\u00b0 azimuth (moon low on opposite horizon). This specific geometric configuration, combined with the celestial alignment requirements, allows us to pinpoint the exact date: January 23, 1405 BC at dawn. The timing aligns with peak hail season in Israel, and indeed more Amorites died from hailstones than from Israel's swords. The five kings hid in a cave at Makkedah and were sealed with rocks\u2014typological of the Day of the Lord when kings hide in caves (Revelation 6:15-17). The Gibeonites (Canaanites who made covenant with Israel) were spared, becoming servants\u2014typological of nations seeking the LORD in the last days (Zechariah 8:20-23). This event has never been equaled and serves as a critical watch date for Day of the Lord parallels: celestial signs, hail judgment, kings hiding, covenant people spared, and 'a day known only to the LORD' (Zechariah 14:7).",

During this year, Jesus also began His Galilean ministry, calling His first disciples and performing many signs.",
