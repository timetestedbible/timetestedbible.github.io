| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | **What TYPE?** | Entity symbol — people characterized by nature |
| 2 | **Explicit definition?** | YES — Acts 10:28 (animals = men), Daniel 4 |

## Critical Evidence: Peter's Vision (Acts 10)

### Acts 10:11-15
> "a certain vessel descending... wherein were all manner of fourfooted **beasts** of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air... What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common."

### Acts 10:28 — THE KEY
> "God hath shewed me that I should not call any **MAN** common or **unclean**"

**THE EXPLICIT INTERPRETATION**:
- The unclean ANIMALS in the vision = **MEN** (specifically Gentiles)
- "Unclean animals" = People outside the covenant
- "Clean animals" = People within the covenant

**ANIMAL = PEOPLE-GROUP**

---

## Critical Evidence: Daniel 4 — Hierarchical Position

### Daniel 4:12, 21
> "the **beasts** of the field had shadow **UNDER it** [the tree]"
> "**UNDER** which the **beasts** of the field dwelt"

| Symbol | Position | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| TREE | Dominant | Empire (Babylon) |
| BEASTS | Under the tree | Subordinate peoples/tribes |

When TREE and ANIMAL appear together, the **spatial relationship** reveals hierarchy:
- TREE = Empire (dominant)
- ANIMAL = Tribes/Sub-states (subordinate)

---

## Evidence: Tribes as Animals (Genesis 49)

### Genesis 49:9 — JUDAH = LION
> "**Judah** is a **lion's** whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up"

### Genesis 49:14 — ISSACHAR = DONKEY
> "**Issachar** is a strong **ass** couching down between two burdens"

### Genesis 49:17 — DAN = SERPENT
> "**Dan** shall be a **serpent** by the way, an adder in the path"

### Genesis 49:21 — NAPHTALI = DEER
> "**Naphtali** is a **hind** let loose"

### Genesis 49:27 — BENJAMIN = WOLF
> "**Benjamin** shall ravin as a **wolf**: in the morning he shall **devour** the prey"

**TRIBES ARE CHARACTERIZED AS ANIMALS**
The specific animal reveals the CHARACTER/NATURE of that tribe.

---

## Dimension 1: WHAT Animal IS

| Evidence | Animal = |
|----------|----------|
| Acts 10:28 | Men / People |
| Daniel 4:12,21 | Peoples dwelling under an empire |
| Genesis 49 | Tribes (characterized by nature) |

**ANIMAL = PEOPLE-GROUP / TRIBE**

A people-group characterized by its nature — subordinate to empires, with the specific animal revealing their character.

---

## Dimension 2: WHAT Animal DOES

Animals **ACT ACCORDING TO THEIR NATURE**.

The specific animal type reveals the CHARACTER of the people-group:

| Animal | Character/Nature | Tribal Example |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Lion** | Royal, dominant, courageous | Judah (Gen 49:9) |
| **Wolf** | Ravenous, dividing | Benjamin (Gen 49:27) |
| **Serpent** | Subtle, cunning | Dan (Gen 49:17) |
| **Donkey** | Strong, burden-bearing | Issachar (Gen 49:14) |
| **Deer/Hind** | Swift, free | Naphtali (Gen 49:21) |

## Clean vs. Unclean Animals

Peter's vision (Acts 10) establishes:

| Category | Symbolic Meaning | Explanation |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **CLEAN animals** | Covenant peoples | Those following God's law |
| **UNCLEAN animals** | Gentile/outside peoples | Those outside the covenant |

### The Lesson of Peter's Vision
> "What **God hath cleansed**, that call not thou common" (Acts 10:15)
> "God hath shewed me that I should not call any **MAN** common or unclean" (Acts 10:28)

The Gentiles (formerly "unclean") are now cleansed and brought into the covenant.

---

## Wild vs. Domestic Animals

| Category | Examples | Character |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Wild Animal** | Lion, bear, wolf, leopard | Predatory, aggressive |
| **Domestic Animal** | Sheep, ox, donkey | Servile, useful, vulnerable |

Wild animals = Peoples with aggressive/predatory character
Domestic animals = Peoples with servile/productive character

---

## Hierarchical Relationship: TREE + ANIMAL

From Daniel 4, the principle of **Resolving Symbolic Overlap via Positional Relationships**:

| Symbol | IS | Position |
|--------|-----|----------|
| **TREE** | Empire | Dominant — provides shadow |
| **ANIMAL** | Tribe/Sub-state | Subordinate — dwells UNDER |

Both TREE and ANIMAL represent collective peoples, but:
- TREE = The dominant, overarching structure (empire)
- ANIMAL = The subordinate peoples characterized by their nature (tribes/sub-states)

---

## Specific Wild Animals in Prophecy

| Animal | Character | Daniel 7 Application |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Lion** | Royal, dominant | Babylon |
| **Bear** | Crushing, powerful | Medo-Persia |
| **Leopard** | Swift, cunning | Greece |
| **Dreadful Beast** | Terrifying, destructive | Rome |

Note: In Daniel 7, the beasts represent KINGDOMS because they are the dominant powers. But when paired with trees (as in Daniel 4), animals are the SUBORDINATE peoples.

## Relationship to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| **TREE** | Empire | ANIMALS dwell UNDER trees |
| **SEA** | Chaotic peoples | BEASTS can rise FROM the sea (Rev 13:1) |
| **BABYLON** | System of confusion | The empire (tree) under which animals dwell |
| **SHEEP** | God's people specifically | Domestic animal = obedient, following |

---

## Conclusion

ANIMAL has **two dimensions**:

1. **WHAT IT IS**: People-group / Tribe — a collective people characterized by its nature; subordinate to empires (trees)

2. **WHAT IT DOES**: Acts According to Nature — the specific animal type reveals the character and behavior of that people-group

Key insights:
- **Acts 10:28** explicitly interprets animals as MEN/PEOPLE
- **Daniel 4** shows animals dwelling UNDER trees (subordinate position)
- **Genesis 49** shows tribes characterized BY specific animals
- **Clean/Unclean** distinction maps to covenant vs. outside peoples
