## Etymology: The Name Means "Confusion"

### Genesis 11:9
> "Therefore is the name of it called **Babel**; because the LORD did there **CONFOUND** the language of all the earth"

| Hebrew | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| בָּבֶל (Babel, H894) | Babel/Babylon |
| בָּלַל (balal, H1101) | To confound, confuse, MIX |

**THE NAME MEANS "CONFUSION"**

Babylon = The system that CONFUSES — mixing God's truth with man's error.

## Evidence: Origin of Organized Rebellion

### Genesis 10:10
> "the beginning of his **KINGDOM** was **Babel**"

Babel was the beginning of NIMROD's kingdom — the first organized rebellion against God after the flood.

### Genesis 11:4
> "let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a **NAME**"

The Tower of Babel = Man's attempt to:
1. Reach heaven BY THEIR OWN EFFORT
2. Make a name for THEMSELVES (not God's name)

**BABYLON = Self-exaltation / Man's way instead of God's way**

---

## Evidence: Mother of Harlots (Revelation 17)

### Revelation 17:5
> "upon her forehead was a name written, **MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS** OF THE EARTH"

| **MOTHER OF HARLOTS** | SOURCE of all idolatry |
| **ABOMINATIONS** | Everything detestable to God |

**BABYLON PRODUCES HARLOTS (IDOLATERS)**

### Revelation 17:18
> "the **woman** which thou sawest is that great **CITY**, which **REIGNETH over the kings of the earth**"

Babylon is a SYSTEM that:
1. Reigns over kings (controlling influence)

## Babylon as TREE (Daniel 4)

- Was cut down in judgment (v.23)

**BABYLON = An empire (tree) of confusion**
