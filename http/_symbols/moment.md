# MOMENT — Symbolic Word Study

## Final Meaning

| Form | Symbolic Meaning |
|------|------------------|
| **One Word** | Judgment |
| **Two Words** | Sudden Judgment |
| **Sentence** | The sudden falling of judgment or destruction — the moment when God's evaluation results in swift action; imports the context of divine reckoning |

**Opposite**: Everlasting / Eternal (what endures beyond judgment)

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Accompanying ACTIONS

The key to understanding "moment" is examining what VERBS accompany it:

| Verse | What Happens "in a moment" |
|-------|---------------------------|
| Numbers 16:21,45 | "**consume** them in a moment" |
| Job 21:13 | "in a moment **go down to the grave**" |
| Job 34:20 | "In a moment shall they **die**" |
| Psalm 73:19 | "brought into **desolation**, as in a moment" |
| Isaiah 47:9 | "these things shall **come** to thee in a moment" (loss, widowhood) |
| Jeremiah 4:20 | "**Destruction**... in a moment" |
| Lamentations 4:6 | "**overthrown** as in a moment" |
| 1 Corinthians 15:52 | "In a moment... we shall be **changed**" |

**The dominant verbs**: CONSUME, DESTROY, DIE, OVERTHROW, DESOLATION, CHANGED

These are all **JUDGMENT actions** — God acting swiftly to evaluate and execute.

---

### 2. The Dominant Pattern

Most uses of "moment" are about **SUDDEN JUDGMENT/DESTRUCTION**:

| Category | Count | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Sudden destruction/judgment | ~70% | Num 16, Job 21, 34, Ps 73, Isa 47, Jer 4, Lam 4 |
| Contrast with eternal | ~30% | Ps 30:5, Isa 54:7-8, 2 Cor 4:17 |

The "contrast" uses (God's anger is "but a moment" vs. His mercy is eternal) are **applications** of the same idea — even God's judgment is brief compared to His everlasting mercy.

---

### 3. The Imported Context

When Scripture uses "moment," it **imports** this subject matter:
- Divine evaluation/reckoning
- Swift execution of judgment
- The sudden falling of consequence

**Example Application**:
> "For a small **moment** have I forsaken thee" (Isaiah 54:7)

Importing the "judgment" context: "For a brief judgment/trial have I forsaken thee — but with everlasting kindness will I gather thee."

The word "moment" signals that JUDGMENT is the subject being addressed.

---

### 4. Why "Temporary" Fails

"Temporary" is merely a **literal synonym** of "moment" — it's what the word literally means in the dictionary.

The SYMBOLIC meaning is revealed by:
- What ACTIONS accompany the word (judgment verbs)
- What CONTEXT the word imports (divine reckoning)
- What EVENT is being described (the falling of judgment)

---

### 5. Connection to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Connection to MOMENT |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **ROCK** | Covenant (eternal) | What endures BEYOND the moment of judgment |
| **SAND** | Broken Covenant | What does NOT survive the moment of judgment |
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | The standard by which the moment of judgment evaluates |
| **SLEEP** | Death/Unaware | The state before awakening to judgment |

The "moment" is when judgment falls — what's built on ROCK survives; what's built on SAND does not.

## Substitution Stress Test

| Verse | With "Sudden Judgment" |
|-------|------------------------|
| Num 16:21 "consume them in a moment" | "consume them in sudden judgment" ✓ |
| Job 34:20 "In a moment shall they die" | "In sudden judgment shall they die" ✓ |
| Ps 73:19 "desolation, as in a moment" | "desolation, as in sudden judgment" ✓ |
| Isa 47:9 "come to thee in a moment" | "come to thee in sudden judgment" ✓ |
| Ps 30:5 "anger but a moment" | "anger but a brief judgment" ✓ |
| Isa 54:7 "small moment... forsaken" | "brief judgment... forsaken" ✓ |
| 1 Cor 15:52 "in a moment... changed" | "in the instant of judgment... transformed" ✓ |

## Methodological Lessons Learned

### 1. Look at ACCOMPANYING ACTIONS
The verbs that accompany a word reveal its symbolic import. For "moment," the verbs (consume, destroy, die) point to JUDGMENT.

### 2. Follow the DOMINANT PATTERN
Don't let secondary uses distract from the majority pattern. Most "moment" uses = sudden destruction.

### 3. Words IMPORT CONTEXT
"Moment" doesn't just mean "brief" — it imports the whole subject of divine judgment into the passage.

### 4. Test for LITERAL SYNONYMS
"Temporary" is a dictionary synonym, not a symbolic meaning. Always push past literal definitions to find the functional/relational/event-based meaning.

---

## Summary

**MOMENT** symbolically means **SUDDEN JUDGMENT** — the swift falling of divine evaluation and its consequences.

The evidence:
1. **Accompanying verbs** = consume, destroy, die, overthrow (judgment actions)
2. **Dominant pattern** = sudden destruction (~70% of uses)
3. **Imported context** = divine reckoning/evaluation
4. **Contrast with eternal** = even this use presupposes judgment is in view

When you see "moment" in Scripture, import the context of **divine judgment suddenly falling**.
