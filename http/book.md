# Lunar Sabbath
### *a time tested tradition*

*Exploring God's Calendar Through Scripture and History*

---

It is the honor of kings to search out a matter and there is no greater mystery than seeking to know Him by honoring his appointed times and Sabbaths. Most assume the calendar and Sabbath day is a settled matter, but few have actually tested this assumption against history, physics, and the rest of scripture.

This book presents a systematic, evidence-based exploration of the biblical calendar system, examining when the day begins, when the month starts, when the year begins, and when the Sabbath falls—all through the lens of Scripture, historical records, and astronomical evidence.
