# Duration: covenant-with-abraham → exodus-from-egypt

## Summary
**From:** `covenant-with-abraham`  
**To:** `exodus-from-egypt`  
**Duration:** 430 years  
**Direction:** after  

The Exodus occurred exactly 430 years after the Covenant with Abraham.

## Calculation

```
exodus-from-egypt = covenant-with-abraham + 430 years
```

Where:
- `covenant-with-abraham` = 1876 BC (Nisan 15)
- `exodus-from-egypt` = 1876 - 430 = 1446 BC (Nisan 15)

## Sources

### Primary Source: Exodus 12:40-41

> "Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt."

— Exodus 12:40-41 (KJV)

### Clarifying Source: Galatians 3:16-17

> "Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made... And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul."

— Galatians 3:16-17 (KJV)

Paul clarifies that the 430 years is from the **Covenant** (not from Jacob's descent into Egypt).

### Supporting Source: Genesis 15

> "And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years."

— Genesis 15:13

Note: The 400 years of affliction is a subset of the 430 years from covenant to Exodus.

## Cross-Validation

| Event | Year |
|-------|------|
| Covenant with Abraham | 1876 BC |
| + 430 years | |
| Exodus from Egypt | 1446 BC |
| + 480 years (1 Kings 6:1) | |
| Solomon's Temple (year 4) | 966 BC |

The 480 years from Exodus to Temple provides independent validation.

## Notes

- "Selfsame day" (Exodus 12:41) indicates the Exodus was on the anniversary of the Covenant
- Both occurred on Nisan 15 (Passover / Unleavened Bread)
- The Covenant is the **primary anchor** for biblical chronology from Abraham to Exodus
