# The Biblical Basis for the New Wine Feast, First Fruits of Wine

The narrative of Moses descending Mount Sinai in Exodus 32, during the events surrounding the Golden Calf, offers a scriptural foundation for recognizing a "New Wine Feast" as an appointed time (moed) in the biblical calendar. This feast, declared by Aaron as a legitimate observance "to YHWH," aligns with the principles of harvest dedication and the inauguration of new wine. The Septuagint's unique phrasing in Moses' identification of the camp's noise emphasizes the initiatory aspect of wine in the celebration, connecting it to Torah laws on first fruits. Without delving into judgments on the execution, this account establishes the feast as a divinely oriented moed, marking the proper beginning of the vintage season through consecrated offerings and joyful partaking.

## The Declaration of the Feast: An Appointed Time to YHWH

As the Israelites awaited Moses' return from Sinai, Aaron responded to their request by creating the Golden Calf and proclaiming a feast. The text presents this as an intentional religious observance dedicated to the God of Israel, framing it as an appointed time for communal celebration. In Exodus 32:5:

> "And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, **Tomorrow is a feast to the LORD** [YHWH]."

The Hebrew word for "feast" here is _chag_ (חַג), often denoting a pilgrimage festival or appointed time (moed) in the Torah's liturgical calendar (e.g., Leviticus 23). By declaring it "to YHWH," Aaron positions the event as a legitimate moed, akin to the appointed times outlined in Leviticus 23:2: "Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, Concerning the **feasts of the LORD** [moedim of YHWH], which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts." The following day involved offerings, eating, drinking, and revelry (Exodus 32:6), elements consistent with biblical harvest feasts where wine plays a central role.

## Moses' Descent and the Identification of the "Beginning with Wine"

Upon descending the mountain, Moses hears the sounds of the feast and discerns its nature. The Septuagint (LXX) rendering of Exodus 32:18 provides a key insight into the wine-focused inauguration:

> "And Moses said, It is not the voice of them that begin the battle, nor the voice of them that begin of defeat, but **the voice of them that begin of wine** do I hear."

The Greek **φωνὴν ἐξαρχόντων οἴνου**—literally "the sound of those leading off with wine" or "beginning with wine"—highlights the feast's initiatory character. The verb **ἐξαρχόντων** (from ἐξάρχω) conveys starting or leading a ritual activity, such as commencing a harvest celebration with the new vintage. This aligns with the feast's declaration as a moed, where the "beginning with wine" marks the appointed time for accessing and celebrating the fresh produce of the vine.

## Torah's Provisions for Wine in Appointed Times: The Role of First Fruits

The Scriptures integrate wine into appointed times through laws ensuring its consecrated use, particularly via first fruits offerings. These establish the proper framework for a feast inaugurating the vintage, as implied in the narrative's harvest-like elements.

-   **Numbers 18:12** addresses the dedication of new wine:
    
    > "All the best of the fresh oil and all the best of the **fresh wine** and of the grain, the **first fruits** of those which they shall offer unto the LORD, I give them to you [the priests]."
    
    This positions the choicest new wine as an offering "to YHWH," mirroring the feast's intent and setting the moed's starting point with divine dedication.
    
-   **Exodus 22:29** emphasizes timely presentation of harvest products:
    
    > "Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy **liquors** [including pressed wine]."
    
    In the context of a feast "to YHWH," this supports beginning the celebration with the vintage's first fruits, aligning with the moed's proclaimed purpose.
    
-   **Leviticus 23:13** (in the context of first fruits at Shavuot, an appointed time):
    
    > "And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of **wine**, the fourth part of an hin."
    
    Wine libations accompany offerings in moedim, illustrating how a feast inaugurating new wine fits within biblical appointed times.
    

## Affirming the New Wine Feast as an Appointed Time

The Golden Calf narrative, with its declared feast "to YHWH" and Moses' recognition of the "beginning with wine," establishes this as a moed tied to the vintage's commencement. Assuming the observance followed Torah principles—focusing on dedication and joy—the account models a New Wine Feast: an appointed time where first fruits of wine are offered, followed by communal celebration. This resonates with broader harvest moedim (e.g., Shavuot in Leviticus 23), where wine symbolizes abundance and thanksgiving. Prophetic echoes, like Joel 2:24 ("The floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with **new wine** and oil"), affirm such a feast as a time of restoration and divine blessing.

In essence, this biblical moed invites recognition of the New Wine Feast as a consecrated appointed time: declare it to YHWH, begin with the first fruits of the vintage, and partake in holy rejoicing, rooted in Scripture's calendar of sacred observances.
