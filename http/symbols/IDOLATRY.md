| Form | Symbolic Meaning |
|------|------------------|
| **One Word** | Self-rule |

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Critical Verse: 1 Samuel 15:23

> "For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and **stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry**. Because thou hast **REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD**, he hath also rejected thee from being king."

This verse explicitly defines what idolatry IS at its core:

| Sin | Equals | Why |
|-----|--------|-----|
| Rebellion | Witchcraft | — |
| Stubbornness | Idolatry | **"Because thou hast REJECTED THE WORD OF THE LORD"** |

**IDOLATRY = REJECTING GOD'S WORD**

Saul's idolatry was not bowing to a statue — it was **rejecting God's word** in favor of his own judgment/will.

---

### 2. Colossians 3:5 — Covetousness IS Idolatry

> "Mortify therefore your members... fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and **covetousness, which IS idolatry**"

Paul explicitly states: **COVETOUSNESS = IDOLATRY**

What is covetousness? **Self-desire** — wanting what you want over what God has ordained.

This confirms: Idolatry at its root is **SELF-WILL** — putting your own desires/standard above God's.

---

### 3. What Is an "Idol"?

An idol is anything you put in God's place as:
- Your authority
- Your master
- Your standard
- Your source of truth

Physical idols (statues) represent spiritual realities — **other authorities** that people serve instead of God.

The ultimate idol is **SELF** — your own will, wisdom, and desires replacing God's.

---

### 4. The First Commandment

> "Thou shalt have **no other gods** before me" (Exodus 20:3)

A "god" is whatever you:
- Serve
- Obey
- Trust in
- Fear
- Look to as ultimate authority

Idolatry = Having "other gods" = Serving other authorities = **Not following God's word as your standard**

---

### 5. Connection to TRUTH

We have established: **TRUTH = God's Standard/Word/Law**

Therefore:
- Following TRUTH = Following God's standard
- IDOLATRY = Following **another** standard (self, man, false gods)

| Choice | Standard Followed |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Faith** | God's Word (TRUTH) |
| **Idolatry** | Self's word / Another's word |

---

### 6. The Hebrew Word: עֲצַבִּים (atsabbim) and גִּלּוּלִים (gillulim)

The Hebrew words for "idols" have revealing meanings:
- **H6091 (atsab)** — from a root meaning "to shape, fashion" — something MAN-MADE
- **H1544 (gillul)** — from a root meaning "to roll" — worthless, dung-like

Idols are **man-made** standards — human fabrications put in place of God's eternal standard.

---

### 7. Isaiah's Mockery of Idols

> "Their idols are silver and gold, **the work of men's hands**" (Psalm 115:4)

> "He burneth part thereof in the fire... and the residue thereof he maketh a god... he worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god" (Isaiah 44:16-17)

The absurdity: Man **creates** his own god, then asks it to save him.

This is the essence of idolatry: **Man creating his own standard** rather than submitting to God's.

---

### 8. The Symbolic Chain

```
FORNICATION (the act)
    ↓
IDOLATRY (serving other masters)
    ↓
SELF-RULE / REJECTING GOD'S WORD (the root)
```

At its deepest level, idolatry is **autonomy** — self-law — being your own god by making your own standard.

---

## Relationship to Symbol Table

| Symbol | Meaning | Connection |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | What we SHOULD follow |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | Following God's standard |
| **BELIEVE** | Obey | The action of following |
| **IDOLATRY** | Self-rule | Rejecting God's standard for another |
| **FORNICATION** | Idolatry | The act of turning to self-rule |

---

## The Opposite of Faith

If **FAITH = Obedience** (to God's word/standard)...

Then **IDOLATRY = Disobedience** (following your own word/standard).

| | Faith | Idolatry |
|--|-------|----------|
| **Standard** | God's Word | Self's word |
| **Posture** | Submission | Autonomy |
| **Action** | Obedience | Self-rule |

---

## Substitution Stress Test

| Verse | With "Self-rule / Rejecting God's Word" |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 Sam 15:23 "stubbornness is as... idolatry" | "stubbornness is as... rejecting God's word" ✓ (explicit!) |
| Col 3:5 "covetousness, which is idolatry" | "self-desire, which is self-rule" ✓ |
| Ezek 14:3 "set up their idols in their heart" | "set up self-rule in their heart" ✓ |
| 1 John 5:21 "keep yourselves from idols" | "keep yourselves from self-rule" ✓ |

---

## Summary

**IDOLATRY** at its core is **SELF-RULE** — rejecting God's word as your standard and replacing it with your own (or another's).

The evidence:
1. **1 Samuel 15:23** explicitly equates idolatry with "rejecting the word of the LORD"
2. **Colossians 3:5** explicitly equates covetousness (self-desire) with idolatry
3. Physical idols are **man-made** — representing man's standards replacing God's
4. The first commandment prohibits "other gods" — other authorities/standards

The ultimate idol is **SELF** — autonomy from God's word.

IDOLATRY is the **opposite of FAITH**:
- Faith = Obedience to God's standard
- Idolatry = Self-rule / Following your own standard
