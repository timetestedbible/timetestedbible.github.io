## Key Proof Texts

- **Isaiah 54:5** — "thy Maker is thine husband"
- **Jeremiah 3:14** — "I am married unto you"
- **Hosea 2:19** — "I will betroth thee unto me for ever"
- **2 Corinthians 11:2** — "espoused you to one husband... Christ"
- **Revelation 19:7** — "the marriage of the Lamb is come"

## The Redundancy Test: Fornication ≠ Sexual Sin

**Leviticus 20:10** — Adultery = **death penalty**

If sexual adultery = death, you don't need divorce provisions for it. The marriage ends by execution.

Therefore "except for fornication" (Matthew 5:32, 19:9) must mean **idolatry**, not sexual sin.

## Grounds for Divorce

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Sexual adultery | Death penalty (Torah) |
| Fornication (idolatry) | Divorce **permitted** |
| Unequally yoked | Divorce **commanded** (Ezra 10:3) |

## Connection to WINGS

**Ruth 3:9** — "spread thy skirt (H3671) over me" = marriage proposal
**Ezekiel 16:8** — "spread my skirt... entered into covenant" = marriage = covenant

WINGS = Covenant Covering. Marriage = coming under covenant covering.

---

## Summary

**MARRIAGE** = **COVENANT PICTURE**

Understanding this unlocks divorce passages: "except for fornication" means "except for idolatry."
