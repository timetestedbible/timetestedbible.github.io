# EAGLE — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Messenger |

## The Key Connection: Eagles and Angels Both Have WINGS

- **Angels** have **WINGS**
- **Eagles** have **WINGS**
- **Cherubim** have the face of an **EAGLE** (Ezekiel 1:10, 10:14, Revelation 4:7)

Since WINGS = Covenant Covering, an EAGLE is the entity that possesses those wings and operates under that covenant authority — a **MESSENGER/ANGEL**.

---

## Key Proof Texts

### Cherubim = Eagle-Faced Angels
- **Ezekiel 1:10** — Cherubim have "the face of an eagle"
- **Revelation 4:7** — Fourth living creature "like a flying eagle"

### Eagles' Wings + Angel (Same Context)
- **Exodus 19:4** — "I bare you on eagles' wings"
- **Exodus 23:20-21** — "I send an angel before you... my name is in him"

### Parable Definition (Ezekiel 17)
- First Eagle = King of Babylon (v.12)
- Second Eagle = Egypt (v.15)
- Empires as God's agents/messengers

### Eagles as Judgment Messengers
- **Hosea 8:1** — Eagle comes "because they have transgressed my covenant"
- **Deuteronomy 28:49** — Nation comes "swift as the eagle"
- **Matthew 24:28** — Eagles gather where the carcass is

## Two Dimensions

| Dimension | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **IS** | Messenger — agent sent under authority |
| **DOES** | Bears/Carries — delivers on behalf of sender |

---

## Relationship to WINGS

- **WINGS** = Covenant Covering (the authority)
- **EAGLE** = Messenger (the entity with that authority)

An eagle HAS wings → A messenger operates UNDER covenant authority.

---

## Conclusion

**EAGLE** = **MESSENGER / ANGEL**

The eagle-faced cherubim, the angel sent before Israel, and empires as God's agents all point to the same meaning: a messenger who bears/carries under covenant authority.
