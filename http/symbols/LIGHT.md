# LIGHT — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Example |
| **Two Words** | Visible Obedience |
| **Sentence** | Visible obedience to God's commandments—living in such a way that others can see righteousness (commandment-keeping) and follow |

**Opposite**: Darkness = Hidden wickedness / concealed living / lawlessness

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly defines both God and believers as "light":

- **1 John 1:5** — "God **is** light, and in him is no darkness at all"
- **John 8:12** — "I **am** the light of the world"
- **Matthew 5:14** — "Ye **are** the light of the world"
- **Ephesians 5:8** — "now **are ye** light in the Lord"

This dual application (God IS light, believers ARE light) is critical. The symbolic meaning must work for both.

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What does light DO in Scripture?

| Function | Verse |
|----------|-------|
| **Shines/Radiates outward** | John 1:5, Matt 5:16, 2 Cor 4:6 |
| **Reveals/Makes manifest** | John 3:21, Eph 5:13 |
| **Enables others to SEE** | Matt 5:16 "that they may see your good works" |
| **Enables others to WALK** | John 11:9-10, 12:35 |
| **Guides/Leads** | Ps 43:3, Luke 1:79, Ps 119:105 |
| **Reproves/Exposes** | John 3:20, Eph 5:13 |

The relational function is key: light doesn't just exist—it **shines so others can see and walk**.

### 3. The Behavioral Evidence

How are we commanded to relate to light?

- **Walk in it**: John 12:35, Eph 5:8, 1 John 1:7
- **Be children of it**: John 12:36, 1 Thess 5:5
- **Let it shine**: Matt 5:16 "Let your light so shine before men"
- **Put on armor of it**: Rom 13:12

### 4. The Antithetical Evidence

Light's opposite is consistently **darkness**, which represents:

- **Hidden/evil deeds**: John 3:19-20 "men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil"
- **Not knowing where you're going**: John 12:35 "he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth"
- **Satan's power**: Acts 26:18 "turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God"
- **Hatred**: 1 John 2:9 "He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness"

If darkness = hidden evil/confusion, then light = **visible righteousness/clarity**.

### 5. The Human Application Test

"Can humans BE light?" — **YES**

- Matt 5:14: "Ye ARE the light of the world"
- Eph 5:8: "now are ye light in the Lord"
- Phil 2:15: "among whom ye shine as lights in the world"

This confirms the meaning must apply to human living, not just divine nature.

### 6. Why "EXAMPLE" and Not Other Meanings?

**Considered alternatives**:

| Meaning | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Truth" | Doesn't capture the outward-shining, visible aspect |
| "Righteousness" | Misses the demonstrative/modeling function |
| "Revelation" | Too focused on information, not lifestyle |

**"Visible Example" unifies all functions**:
- It shines outward (examples are seen)
- It enables others to see and walk (examples show the way)
- It reproves by contrast (good example exposes bad conduct)
- It guides (examples lead)

### 7. The Substitution Test

| Verse | Substitution |
|-------|--------------|
| "God is light" | "God is [visible example]" ✓ |
| "Ye are the light of the world" | "Ye are the [visible example] of the world" ✓ |
| "Let your light shine before men that they may see your good works" | "Let your [example] shine before men that they may see your good works" ✓✓ |
| "Walk as children of light" | "Walk as children of [example]" ✓ |
| "I am the light of the world" | "I am the [visible example] of the world" ✓ |

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Matthew 5:14-16** — "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid... Let your light so shine before men, **that they may see your good works**, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."

   This is the clearest text: light = something visible that others SEE, resulting in observable WORKS.

2. **1 John 1:5-7** — "God is light, and in him is no darkness at all... if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another."

   Walking in light = living openly, without hidden sin, enabling fellowship.

3. **Ephesians 5:8-13** — "ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light... all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light."

   Light's function is to MAKE MANIFEST—to bring things into visible evidence.

4. **John 3:19-21** — "men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil... he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest."

   The contrast: those with evil deeds HIDE (darkness); those with good deeds come into the OPEN (light) as an example.

## 8. Example of WHAT? — Closing the Loop

The study establishes that LIGHT = "visible example." But example of *what*? The texts reference "righteousness" and "good works" — but these terms require definition.

Scripture explicitly defines righteousness:

> "And it shall be our **righteousness**, if we observe to do all these **commandments** before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us." (Deuteronomy 6:25)

> "My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy **commandments** are **righteousness**." (Psalm 119:172)

> "For it had been better for them not to have known **the way of righteousness**, than, after they have known it, to turn from **the holy commandment** delivered unto them." (2 Peter 2:21)

The equation is explicit:
- **Righteousness = Commandments**
- **The way of righteousness = The holy commandment**

Therefore, "good works" and "righteousness" in Matthew 5:16 ("that they may see your good works") refers to **visible obedience to God's commandments**.

The full chain:
- **LIGHT** = Visible Example
- Example of **righteousness** / **good works**
- **Righteousness** = Commandments (Deut 6:25, Ps 119:172)
- **Good works** = Obedience to commandments

**LIGHT = Visible Example of Commandment-Keeping**

This is why Jesus, immediately after saying "Ye are the light of the world" (Matt 5:14), says:

> "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." (Matthew 5:17-18)

The "good works" that constitute "light" are defined by the law that follows in the Sermon on the Mount.

## Conclusion

LIGHT symbolizes **visible, exemplary living**—conducting oneself in such a way that others can observe, learn from, and follow. Specifically, it is the visible demonstration of **obedience to God's commandments** (righteousness).

This meaning works for:
- **God**: The perfect visible example of righteousness (His own standard)
- **Christ**: The embodiment of that example ("I am the light") — Torah made flesh
- **Believers**: Called to BE that visible example ("Ye are the light") — living Torah before others
