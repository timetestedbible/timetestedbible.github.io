# BABYLON — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Kingdom |
| **Two Words** | Worldly Kingdom |
| **Sentence** | The worldly kingdom system built on human authority and effort—man's substitute for God's covenant, using brick (man-made) instead of stone (God-given), the "mother of harlots" because all idolatry flows from rejecting God's Kingdom for man's |

**Opposite**: Jerusalem/Zion (Heavenly Kingdom)

---

## The Key Insight: Brick vs. Stone

### Genesis 11:3
> "they had **brick** for **stone**"

| Material | Symbolic | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| STONE | Covenant | God-given |
| BRICK | Man-made substitute | Human effort |

**Babylon uses human substitutes for what only God can provide.**

---

## Genesis 11:4 — Making Their Own Covenant

> "let us make us a **NAME**"

- NAME = Covenant
- "Let us make us a NAME" = Self-made covenant, self-authority

This contrasts with God **giving** His NAME (covenant) to His people.

## Worldly Kingdom vs. Heavenly Kingdom

| Worldly (Babylon) | Heavenly (Jerusalem) |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Man's authority | God's authority |
| Brick (man-made) | Stone (God-given) |
| Our name | God's NAME |
| Man reaching up | God coming down |
| Works | Grace |
| "I am, none else" | "I AM" (true God) |

---

## Key Evidence

**Isaiah 47:8** — "I am, and none else beside me"
- Babylon claims to BE God

**Daniel 4:30** — "I have built by MY power for MY majesty"
- Human glory, human achievement

**Revelation 17:5** — "MOTHER OF HARLOTS"
- All idolatry flows from choosing man's kingdom over God's

## Why "Kingdom" Not "Confusion"

"Confusion" is the **result/judgment**, not the **essence**.

Babylon IS the Worldly Kingdom. Confusion is what happens when man rejects God's rule.

1. Human authority replacing God's
2. Human effort (brick) replacing divine provision (stone)
3. Self-made covenant replacing God's covenant
