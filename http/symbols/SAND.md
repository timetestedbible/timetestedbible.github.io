## Sand Becomes Rock

Christ IS the Rock:
> **1 Corinthians 10:4** — "that Rock was Christ"

We become living stones when bound to Him:
> **1 Peter 2:4-5** — "To whom coming, as unto a living stone... Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house"

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Sand | Multitudes — separate individuals |
| + Christ | Bound by covenant to the living stone |
| = Living Stones | Built into a spiritual house |
| = Island | Covenant community rising above the sea |

The rock is sand bound by covenant to Christ. Individual grains become a unified structure — an island standing above the nations.

## The Seashore = The Wings = The Place of Covenant Offer

The Hebrew word **כָּנָף (kanaph, H3671)** is translated as:
- **Wings** (of birds, cherubim)
- **Skirt/border** (of garments — Numbers 15:38)
- **Corners/ends of the earth** (Job 37:3, 38:13, Isaiah 11:12)

The "ends of the earth" ARE the "wings of the earth" — the coasts where land meets sea.

> **Job 38:13** — "That it might take hold of the **ends** (H3671 - kanaph/wings) of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it"

> **Isaiah 11:12** — "gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four **corners** (H3671 - kanaph/wings) of the earth"

This connects directly to WINGS = Covenant Covering:

> **Ezekiel 16:8** — "I spread my **skirt** (H3671) over thee... and entered into a **COVENANT** with thee"

And WINGS = Reminder of Commandments (Torah):

> **Numbers 15:38-40** — "make them fringes in the **borders** (H3671 kanaph) of their garments... that ye may look upon it, and **remember all the commandments** of the LORD, and **do them**... that ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy"

> **Deuteronomy 22:12** — "make thee fringes upon the four **quarters** (H3671 kanaph) of thy vesture"

The tzitzit (fringes) are placed on the WINGS (kanaph) of the garment — and their purpose is to remind of the commandments.

The chain:
| Term | Hebrew | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Seashore** | — | Where sand exists |
| **Coast/Ends/Corners** | H3671 kanaph | Same word as wings |
| **Wings** | H3671 kanaph | Covenant covering |
| **Borders of garment** | H3671 kanaph | Where tzitzit are placed |
| **Tzitzit** | — | Reminder of commandments (Torah) |

**The seashore is the place where the covenant wings extend — where Torah is offered to the multitudes.**

Sand at the seashore = multitudes at the place where covenant is offered. They stand at the boundary where God's wings reach out to cover:

> **Matthew 23:37** — "how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens **under her wings**, and ye would not!"

The seashore is the meeting point — where the covenant covering is offered to the multitudes. Some come under the wings (enter covenant, become living stones). Others are swept into the sea (lost among the nations).
