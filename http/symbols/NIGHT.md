# NIGHT — Symbol Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Hiddenness |
| **Two Words** | Season of Unawareness |
| **Sentence** | The season of hiddenness and closed opportunity—the time when conduct is concealed, when work cannot be done, and when spiritual sleep and drunkenness prevail |

**Opposite**: Day = Exposure / Time of Accountability

## The Argument

### 1. The Definitional Evidence

Scripture explicitly equates NIGHT with DARKNESS:

- **Genesis 1:5** — "God called the light Day, and the **darkness** he called **Night**"

This is foundational: **NIGHT = DARKNESS**. Since DARKNESS = Concealed Disobedience / Hidden, NIGHT represents the *time/season* of that hiddenness.

The parallel is confirmed throughout Scripture:

- **1 Thessalonians 5:5** — "Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the **night**, nor of **darkness**"
- **Romans 13:12** — "The **night** is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of **darkness**"

### 2. The Functional Evidence

What does "night" represent functionally?

| Function | Verse |
|----------|-------|
| **End of opportunity** | John 9:4 — "the **night** cometh, when no man can work" |
| **Time of stumbling** | John 11:10 — "if a man walk in the **night**, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him" |
| **Time of sleep** | 1 Thess 5:7 — "they that sleep sleep in the **night**" |
| **Time of drunkenness** | 1 Thess 5:7 — "they that be drunken are drunken in the **night**" |
| **Time of thievery** | 1 Thess 5:2 — "the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the **night**" |
| **Time of concealment** | 2 Sam 12:12 — David did his sin secretly (by "night," metaphorically) |

The pattern: NIGHT = the time when opportunity closes, when awareness fades, when hidden conduct occurs.

### 3. The "Thief in the Night" Pattern

The imagery of a thief coming in the night reveals the symbolic meaning:

- **1 Thessalonians 5:2** — "the day of the Lord so cometh **as a thief in the night**"
- **1 Thessalonians 5:4** — "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you **as a thief**"
- **2 Peter 3:10** — "the day of the Lord will come **as a thief in the night**"

Why does a thief come at night? Because night provides **cover for hidden action**. Those "in darkness" are caught off guard; those "of the day" are not. The judgment that comes "as a thief" catches those who are spiritually asleep, unaware, living in hiddenness.

### 4. The Sleep and Drunkenness Association

Night is explicitly associated with spiritual unawareness:

- **1 Thessalonians 5:6-7** — "Therefore let us not **sleep**, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that **sleep** sleep in the **night**; and they that be **drunken** are drunken in the **night**"

Both sleep and drunkenness represent states of unawareness:
- **Sleep** = spiritual unconsciousness, unresponsiveness to truth (see SLEEP symbol study)
- **Drunkenness** = impaired judgment, loss of self-control

These occur "in the night"—during the season of hiddenness and unawareness.

### 5. The "Night Cometh When No Man Can Work" Pattern

- **John 9:4** — "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: **the night cometh, when no man can work**"

Night = the end of opportunity. The time for visible, productive work closes. This has both immediate and eschatological applications:
- **Immediate**: Jesus' earthly ministry had limited time
- **Eschatological**: The time for repentance and obedience will close

### 6. Why "HIDDENNESS" / "SEASON OF UNAWARENESS"?

**Considered alternatives:**

| Meaning | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| "Nighttime hours" | Dictionary definition—physical, not symbolic |
| "Concealed disobedience" (same as DARKNESS) | NIGHT = DARKNESS, but NIGHT emphasizes the TIME aspect |
| "Adversity" (from Strong's) | Partial—but doesn't capture the hiding/unawareness pattern |

**"Hiddenness / Season of Unawareness" captures both functions:**
- The time when things are **hidden** (thieves operate, sin is concealed)
- The time when people are **unaware** (sleep, drunkenness)
- The time when **opportunity closes** (no man can work)

### 7. The Human Application Test

"Can humans BE 'of the night'?" — **YES (negatively)**

- 1 Thessalonians 5:5: "we are not **of the night**, nor of darkness"

Believers are NOT to be "of the night"—they should not live in the realm of hiddenness and spiritual unawareness. The exhortation to "watch and be sober" (v.6) is the opposite of the night's characteristics (sleep, drunkenness).

## Key Proof Texts

1. **Genesis 1:5** — "God called the light Day, and the **darkness** he called **Night**"
   
   The foundational equation: NIGHT = DARKNESS. This establishes that "night" symbolically represents what "darkness" represents—hiddenness, concealment.

2. **John 9:4** — "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: **the night cometh, when no man can work**"
   
   Night = end of opportunity. The time for visible work closes. This creates urgency—work while you can.

3. **1 Thessalonians 5:5-7** — "we are not **of the night**, nor of darkness. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober. For they that sleep sleep **in the night**; and they that be drunken are drunken **in the night**"
   
   Night is characterized by sleep (unawareness) and drunkenness (impaired judgment). Believers are called OUT of this realm.

4. **John 11:9-10** — "If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. But if a man walk **in the night**, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him"
   
   Walking "in the night" = stumbling because of lack of light/guidance. Night represents the absence of visible direction.

5. **Romans 13:12** — "**The night** is far spent, **the day** is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light"
   
   The night/darkness era is ending; the day/light era is coming. The appropriate response: abandon works of darkness (hidden conduct) and put on the armor of light (visible righteousness).

## Conclusion

NIGHT symbolizes **hiddenness** and the **season of unawareness**—the time when conduct is concealed, when spiritual sleep and drunkenness prevail, and when the opportunity for visible work closes.

While DARKNESS describes the *state* of concealed disobedience, NIGHT describes the *time* when that hiddenness prevails. This is why:
- Thieves come "in the night" (hidden action)
- Sleep and drunkenness occur "in the night" (spiritual unawareness)
- "No man can work" when night comes (opportunity closes)

The practical application: believers are called OUT of the night. "We are not of the night, nor of darkness." The exhortation is to "watch and be sober"—to remain spiritually awake and clear-minded, not living in the hiddenness and unawareness that characterize the night.
