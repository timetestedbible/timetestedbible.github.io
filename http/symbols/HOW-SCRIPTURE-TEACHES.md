# How Scripture Teaches: Parables, Similitudes, and Symbolic Language

## Why This Matters

Before we can interpret symbols, we must understand that **Scripture itself declares it teaches through symbols**. This is not a modern interpretive framework imposed on the text — it is the Bible's own stated methodology.

## God Declares His Teaching Method

### Hosea 12:10 — The Divine Method

> "I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied **visions**, and **used similitudes**, by the ministry of the prophets."

God explicitly states He uses:
- **Visions** (H2377 *chazon*) — prophetic sight, revelation
- **Similitudes** (H1819 *damah*) — comparisons, likenesses, symbolic representations

This is not occasional — He "multiplied" them. Symbolic teaching is God's **primary method** through the prophets.

## The Vocabulary of Biblical Teaching

Scripture uses specific terms for its teaching methods:

| Term | Hebrew/Greek | Definition | Example |
|------|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Parable** | H4912 *mashal* / G3850 *parabolē* | A pithy maxim, simile, comparison; fictitious narrative conveying deeper truth | Matthew 13, Ezekiel 17 |
| **Proverb** | H4912 *mashal* / G3942 *paroimia* | Same as parable; an adage or enigmatical saying | Proverbs, John 16:25 |
| **Riddle / Dark Saying** | H2420 *chidah* | A puzzle, enigma, hidden meaning requiring interpretation | Judges 14:12, Psalm 78:2 |
| **Similitude** | H8544 *temunah* / H1819 *damah* | Likeness, comparison, symbolic representation | Hosea 12:10, Numbers 12:8 |
| **Vision** | H2377 *chazon* / H4759 *marah* | Prophetic sight; revelation through imagery | Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation |
| **Dream** | H2472 *chalom* | Nighttime revelation, often symbolic | Genesis 37, Daniel 2, 4, 7 |
| **Allegory** | G238 *allēgoreō* | Extended metaphor where elements represent other things | Galatians 4:24 |
| **Mystery** | G3466 *mystērion* | Hidden truth revealed only to initiates | Matthew 13:11, Ephesians 3 |

Note: **Parable** and **Proverb** are often the SAME Hebrew word (*mashal*). The distinction between "parable" and "literal proverb" is artificial.

## Jesus Spoke ONLY in Parables to the Multitudes

### Matthew 13:34-35

> "All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude **in parables**; and **without a parable spake he not unto them**: That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been **kept secret from the foundation of the world**."

### Mark 4:33-34

> "And with many such **parables** spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it. But **without a parable spake he not unto them**: and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples."

**Critical points:**
1. Jesus spoke to the public **ONLY** in parables — never plainly
2. This fulfilled prophecy (Psalm 78:2)
3. The parables contain things "kept secret from the foundation of the world"
4. Private explanation was given only to disciples

---

## WHY Parables? — To Hide and Reveal

### Matthew 13:10-13

> "And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the **mysteries** of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is **not given**... Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."

### Mark 4:11-12

> "Unto you it is given to know the **mystery** of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things are done in parables: That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; **lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them**."

### Isaiah 6:9-10 (The Source)

> "Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; **lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed**."

**The shocking truth:** Parables are designed to **hide** truth from those who won't obey, while **revealing** it to those who will. Understanding is a gift, not a right.

## Two Levels of Communication

### Numbers 12:6-8 — Moses vs. Prophets

> "If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a **vision**, and will speak unto him in a **dream**. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house. With him will I speak **mouth to mouth**, even apparently, and **not in dark speeches**; and the **similitude** of the LORD shall he behold."

| Method | Who | Type |
|--------|-----|------|
| Visions, dreams, dark speeches | Prophets | Symbolic, requiring interpretation |
| Mouth to mouth, plainly | Moses (and eventually all who enter rest) | Direct, clear |

Most Scripture comes through the prophetic channel — through symbols.

### John 16:25, 29 — The Promise of Plain Speech

> "These things have I spoken unto you in **proverbs**: but the time cometh, when I shall **no more speak unto you in proverbs**, but I shall shew you **plainly** of the Father."

> "His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou **plainly**, and speakest **no proverb**."

A time is coming (or has come for those who enter) when parables give way to plain speech. But until then, we must learn to read the symbols.

## Types of Symbolic Teaching in Scripture

### 1. Parables — Fictitious Narratives with Moral/Spiritual Truth

Examples: Sower, Wheat and Tares, Prodigal Son, Good Samaritan

These are not historical events but constructed stories where each element represents something.

### 2. Allegories — Extended Metaphors

> **Galatians 4:24** — "Which things are an **allegory**: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar."

Paul explicitly calls the Hagar/Sarah narrative an allegory — the historical people represent covenants.

### 3. Similitudes — Direct Comparisons

"The kingdom of heaven is LIKE..." — a direct comparison between something known and something unknown.

### 4. Riddles / Dark Sayings — Puzzles Requiring Interpretation

> **Proverbs 1:6** — "To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their **dark sayings**."

Some truths are intentionally obscured, requiring effort to uncover.

### 5. Prophetic Visions — Symbolic Imagery

Daniel's beasts, Ezekiel's wheels, John's Revelation — these are not literal descriptions but symbolic visions representing kingdoms, spiritual realities, and future events.

### 6. Historical Events as Parables

Many "literal" events are ALSO parables — the physical journey teaches spiritual truth.

> **1 Corinthians 10:11** — "Now all these things happened unto them for **examples** (G5179 *typos* — types, patterns): and they are written for our admonition."

The Exodus, wilderness wandering, conquest — these happened AND they represent spiritual realities.

## Precept Upon Precept — How to Learn

### Isaiah 28:10, 13

> "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little"

Truth is scattered throughout Scripture — "here a little, there a little." Understanding requires:
1. Gathering all references to a symbol
2. Comparing Scripture with Scripture
3. Building meaning "line upon line"

This is why symbol studies must be comprehensive, not based on isolated verses.

---

## Why Symbolic Language?

### 1. To Test Hearts

Parables separate seekers from casual hearers. Those who truly want truth will dig; those who don't will move on.

> **Proverbs 25:2** — "It is the glory of God to **conceal** a thing: but the honour of kings is to **search out** a matter."

### 2. To Protect Truth

Plain truth given to rebels becomes ammunition for blasphemy. Symbols protect sacred things.

### 3. To Create Depth

Symbols carry multiple layers of meaning that plain statements cannot. One symbol can teach for a lifetime.

### 4. To Connect All of Scripture

The same symbols appear throughout — ROCK, WATER, LIGHT, BREAD, WINE, SEA, etc. They create a unified language that binds Genesis to Revelation.

### 5. To Require Relationship

Understanding comes through relationship with God and His people. Symbols force community (teaching) and dependence on the Spirit.

---

## Implications for Reading Scripture

### 1. Expect Symbols

Don't assume literal reading is "default." The Bible declares it teaches through parables, similitudes, visions, and dark sayings.

### 2. Let Scripture Interpret Scripture

The same symbol means the same thing throughout. If ROCK = Christ in 1 Corinthians 10:4, look for that meaning elsewhere.

### 3. Look for Patterns

Historical events often function as types/parables. The physical teaches the spiritual.

### 4. Seek the Mystery

Truth is hidden for the seeker, not from the seeker. Dig. Ask. Search.

### 5. Test Meanings Universally

A symbolic meaning should be consistently and universally applied. If a proposed meaning fails across multiple occurrences, it's likely wrong.

However, some nuance is required:
- **Compound symbols** derive meaning from combination with other symbols (e.g., "four winds" vs. "wind" alone)
- **Context** is determined by surrounding symbols, not surrounding literal words
- The meaning should hold even through apparently "literal" narratives — physical journeys often function as spiritual parables

## Conclusion

Scripture is not a book of plain propositions but a treasury of symbolic teaching. God Himself declares: "I have used similitudes" (Hosea 12:10). Jesus spoke only in parables to the multitudes (Matthew 13:34). The mysteries are given to those who seek (Matthew 13:11).

To read Scripture literally when it intends symbolically is to miss the message. To read it symbolically when it intends literally is equally dangerous. Wisdom discerns which is which — and wisdom comes from the fear of the LORD and diligent seeking.
