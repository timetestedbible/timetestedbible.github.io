## Critical Discovery: H226 = Mark = Sign = Token

The KJV translates the SAME Hebrew word (H226 - אוֹת - 'owth) as three different English words:

| English | Verse | Text |
|---------|-------|------|
| **mark** | Genesis 4:15 | "the LORD set a **mark**{H226} upon Cain" |
| **sign** | Exodus 31:13 | "my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a **sign**{H226} between me and you" |
| **sign** | Exodus 31:17 | "It is a **sign**{H226} between me and the children of Israel for ever" |
| **token** | Genesis 9:12 | "This is the **token**{H226} of the covenant which I make" |
| **token** | Genesis 17:11 | "it shall be a **token**{H226} of the covenant betwixt me and you" |
| **sign** | Deuteronomy 6:8 | "bind them for a **sign**{H226} upon thine hand" |

**This means**: Understanding any of these (mark, sign, token) illuminates all of them. They are the same concept.

## What IS the Mark/Sign/Token?

Looking at what Scripture says the sign/token literally IS:

| Verse | The H226 IS... |
|-------|----------------|
| Genesis 9:12 | The **rainbow** |
| Genesis 17:11 | **Circumcision** |
| Exodus 12:13 | The **blood** on doorposts |
| Exodus 31:13 | The **Sabbath** |
| Deuteronomy 6:8 | The **commandments** on hand/forehead |

What do circumcision, Sabbath, and the law on hand/forehead have in common?

They are **OBSERVANCES** — practices that identify covenant membership.

---

## Key Proof: Deuteronomy 6:6-8

> **v.6**: "And these words, which I **command** thee this day, shall be in thine heart"
> **v.8**: "And thou shalt bind **them** for a **sign** upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes"

The "them" refers to "these words which I command" — the **commandments themselves ARE the sign**.

The practice/observance of the commandments IS the mark.

---

## Key Proof: Exodus 13:9

> "And it shall be for a **sign** unto thee upon thine **hand**, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that **the LORD's law** may be in thy mouth"

The sign on the hand is explicitly connected to **practicing the LORD's law**.

## How Does One TAKE the Mark?

| God's Mark | Beast's Mark |
|------------|--------------|
| **Keep** the Sabbath | **Follow** the beast's system |
| **Observe** God's commandments | **Practice** the beast's ordinances |
| **Do** what God commands (hand) | **Do** what the beast commands (hand) |
| **Think** according to God's word (forehead) | **Think** according to the beast's ideology (forehead) |

You TAKE the mark by **PRACTICING/OBSERVING** what the authority commands.

---

## The Revelation Contrast

| God's People | Beast's People |
|--------------|----------------|
| Father's **NAME** in foreheads (Rev 14:1) | Beast's **MARK** in hand/forehead (Rev 13:16) |
| "Keep the **commandments** of God" (Rev 14:12) | "**Worship** the beast and his image" (Rev 14:9) |
| **Sealed** by God (Rev 7:3) | **Marked** by the beast |

The mark identifies which authority's practices you observe.

---

## Location: Hand and Forehead

| Location | Represents | Meaning |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Hand** | Actions/Works | What you **DO** |
| **Forehead** | Mind/Thoughts | What you **BELIEVE/THINK** |

The mark in hand and forehead = your **practices and beliefs** align with that authority.

---

## Relationship to Other Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning | Relationship to MARK |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **NAME** | Covenant | The relationship itself |
| **MARK** | Observance | The visible practice that identifies covenant membership |
| **TRUTH** | God's Standard | The content of what is observed |
| **FAITH** | Obedience | The response to the standard (practicing it) |

The **NAME** is the covenant relationship.
The **MARK** is the observance that shows which covenant you're in.

## Different Hebrew/Greek Words

Multiple original words are translated "mark" in English:

| Strong's | Word | Used In | Notes |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| **H226** | אוֹת ('owth) | Gen 4:15, Exo 31:13, etc. | Sign, token, mark — OBSERVANCE |
| H8420 | תָּו (tav) | Ezekiel 9:4, 9:6 | The letter TAV (ancient shape: X or +) |
| G5480 | χάραγμα (charagma) | Revelation 13-20 | Stamp, imprint, engraving |
| G4742 | στίγμα (stigma) | Galatians 6:17 | Brand mark (slave brand) |
| G4649 | σκοπός (skopos) | Philippians 3:14 | Goal, target (different concept) |

The Revelation "mark" (G5480 - charagma) relates to the same concept: visible identification of allegiance through practice.

---

## The Ezekiel Mark (H8420 - Tav)

In Ezekiel 9:4, the mark is specifically the Hebrew letter **TAV** (ת).

In ancient/paleo-Hebrew, TAV was written as an **X** or **+** shape — like a signature mark.

Those who "sigh and cry for all the abominations" receive this mark and are protected.
Those without it are slain.

The TAV marked those whose hearts (and presumably practices) aligned with God's standard.

## Summary

**MARK** = **OBSERVANCE / VISIBLE PRACTICE**

The mark is not the covenant itself (that's the NAME), but the observable practice that identifies which covenant you belong to. You TAKE the mark by PRACTICING what an authority commands — in your actions (hand) and thoughts (forehead).

- God's mark = observing God's commandments (Sabbath, His law, His ways)
- Beast's mark = observing the beast's system (his calendar, his laws, his ways)

Your practices reveal your master.
