## The Argument

### 1. Explicit Biblical Definition

Scripture provides a direct, explicit definition of what "waters" and "sea" represent:

> **Revelation 17:15** — "The **waters** which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are **peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues**."

This is one of the clearest symbolic definitions in all of Scripture. The sea/waters represent:
- Peoples (λαοί / laoi)
- Multitudes (ὄχλοι / ochloi)
- Nations (ἔθνη / ethnē)
- Tongues/Languages (γλῶσσαι / glōssai)

### 2. The Sea as Chaotic and Turbulent

The sea is characterized by constant motion, instability, and chaos:

> **Isaiah 57:20** — "But the **wicked** are like the **troubled sea**, when it **cannot rest**, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."

> **Isaiah 17:12** — "Woe to the multitude of many **people**, which make a noise like the **noise of the seas**; and to the rushing of **nations**, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty **waters**!"

The sea represents:
- Restlessness (cannot rest)
- Turbulence (troubled, rushing)
- The wicked/unsanctified masses

### 3. Beasts Rise from the Sea

In prophetic visions, world empires/kingdoms rise FROM the sea (the nations):

> **Daniel 7:2-3** — "The four winds of the heaven strove upon the great **sea**. And four great **beasts** came up from the **sea**, diverse one from another."

> **Revelation 13:1** — "And I stood upon the sand of the **sea**, and saw a **beast rise up out of the sea**, having seven heads and ten horns..."

The beasts (kingdoms/empires) emerge FROM the sea (the mass of peoples/nations). This confirms: SEA = the nations from which political powers arise.

### 4. Contrast with Dry Land / Islands

The sea contrasts with dry land and islands:
- **Sea** = fluid, chaotic, unstable, profane masses
- **Land/Island** = solid, stable, set apart, sanctified

> **Genesis 1:9-10** — "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the **dry land** appear... And God called the dry land **Earth**; and the gathering together of the waters called he **Seas**."

The separation of sea from land in creation establishes the symbolic pattern: ORDER (land) distinguished from CHAOS (sea).

### 5. "No More Sea" in the New Creation

> **Revelation 21:1** — "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was **no more sea**."

In the renewed creation, there is "no more sea" — no more chaotic, unsanctified mass of peoples in rebellion. All are either part of God's holy nation or removed. The sea (turbulent, wicked nations) is eliminated.

## Key Insight: Foundation for Related Symbols

Understanding SEA as "chaotic peoples/nations" unlocks related symbols:

| Symbol | Relationship to Sea | Symbolic Meaning |

| **ISLAND** | Land SET APART FROM the sea | Sanctified/Holy people |

## Conclusion

**SEA** symbolically represents **the mass of humanity** — peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues — particularly in their **unsanctified, chaotic, turbulent state**. This is explicitly defined in Revelation 17:15 and confirmed by multiple prophetic passages that compare the restless wicked to the troubled sea.

The sea stands in contrast to dry land and islands, which represent stability and separation (sanctification) from the chaotic masses.
