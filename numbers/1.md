## The Argument

### 1. The Shema: God Is One

> **Deuteronomy 6:4** — "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is **one**"

This foundational declaration establishes one as the number of divine unity. God is not many gods—He is ONE.

### 2. One Mediator, One Way

| Reference | The "One" |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 Timothy 2:5 | "**one** mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" |
| John 14:6 | "I am **the** way, **the** truth, and **the** life" |
| Ephesians 4:5 | "**one** Lord, **one** faith, **one** baptism" |
| Acts 4:12 | "none other name... whereby we must be saved" |

There is ONE path, not many. One mediator, not multiple.

### 3. Creation Begins with "One Day"

> **Genesis 1:5** — "the evening and the morning were **the first day**" (Hebrew: יוֹם אֶחָד, "day one")

God called it "one day" (not "first day" in Hebrew), emphasizing the singular beginning of creation.

### 4. One Man's Sin, One Man's Righteousness

> **Romans 5:12** — "by **one man** sin entered into the world"

> **Romans 5:19** — "by **one** man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of **one** shall many be made righteous"

The pattern: ONE man brought sin, ONE man brings salvation.

### 5. Unity of Believers in Christ

> **John 17:21-22** — "That they all may be **one**; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be **one** in us"

> **Galatians 3:28** — "ye are all **one** in Christ Jesus"

Believers are called to reflect the divine unity—many becoming ONE.
