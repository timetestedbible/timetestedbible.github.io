| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Victory |

**Opposite**: Defeat / Failure / Overcome

## The Argument

### 1. The Flood Began and Ended on the Seventeenth

> **Genesis 7:11** — "In the second month, the **seventeenth** day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up"

> **Genesis 8:4** — "the ark rested in the **seventh** month, on the **seventeenth** day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat"

The flood—judgment on sin—began and ended on the SEVENTEENTH. Noah's ark rested (victory) on the 17th.

### 2. Resurrection on the Seventeenth

Christ rose from the dead on Nisan 17:
- Passover = Nisan 14
- Unleavened Bread = Nisan 15
- Firstfruits = "morrow after the sabbath" (Nisan 16 or 17)
- Resurrection = Nisan 17

The ultimate victory over death occurred on the SEVENTEENTH.

### 3. Joseph Sold at Seventeen

> **Genesis 37:2** — "Joseph, being **seventeen years** old, was feeding the flock with his brethren"

Joseph was SEVENTEEN when sold into slavery—but his story is one of ultimate victory and exaltation.

### 4. Jacob's Final Seventeen Years

> **Genesis 47:28** — "Jacob lived in the land of Egypt **seventeen years**"

Jacob spent his last SEVENTEEN years in peace and provision—victory after years of struggle.

### 5. Ten Plus Seven: Order Plus Perfection

**17 = 10 + 7**

- 10 = Divine order and law
- 7 = Spiritual perfection

Together: Order fulfilled to perfection = VICTORY.

## Key Occurrences

| Context | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Flood began (Gen 7:11) | 17th day—judgment starts |
| Ark rested (Gen 8:4) | 17th day—victory achieved |
| Joseph's age (Gen 37:2) | 17 years—before triumph |
| Jacob in Egypt (Gen 47:28) | 17 years—final peace |
| Christ's resurrection | Nisan 17—ultimate victory |
| 153 = 1+2+...+17 | Sum to victory |

## The 153 Connection

**153 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17**

The number of fish caught (Jn 21:11) equals the sum of all integers to SEVENTEEN. The complete harvest comes through victory.

## The Flood Pattern

| Event | Day | Significance |
|-------|-----|--------------|
| Flood begins | 2nd month, 17th | Judgment starts |
| Ark rests | 7th month, 17th | Victory achieved |
| Exactly 5 months | 150 days | Grace period |

From 2/17 to 7/17 = five months—GRACE (5) leading to VICTORY (17).

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **7** | Perfection; 17 = 10 + 7 |
| **10** | Order; 17 = 10 + 7 |
| **153** | Sum of 1-17 (complete harvest) |
| **8** | Resurrection; 17 brings new life |

---

## Summary

**SEVENTEEN** symbolizes **VICTORY**—spiritual triumph and overcoming. The ark rested on the 17th after judgment. Christ rose on (or near) the 17th—ultimate victory over death. As 10 + 7, it combines divine order with spiritual perfection. Seventeen is the number of conquest, resurrection, and complete triumph.
