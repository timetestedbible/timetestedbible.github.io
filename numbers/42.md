# 42 — Number Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Tribulation |
| **Two Words** | Antichrist's Time |
| **Sentence** | The number of tribulation and opposition to God—representing the period of the beast's authority, Gentile trampling, and the complete span of Israel's generations to the Messiah |

**Opposite**: Peace / Divine rule / Deliverance

---

## The Argument

### 1. Forty-Two Months of Beast's Authority

> **Revelation 13:5** — "and power was given unto him to continue **forty and two months**"

The beast is given authority for FORTY-TWO months—the duration of his oppressive rule (3.5 years).

### 2. Forty-Two Months of Gentile Trampling

> **Revelation 11:2** — "the holy city shall they tread under foot **forty and two months**"

Jerusalem is trampled by Gentiles for FORTY-TWO months—the same tribulation period.

### 3. Jesus' Genealogy: Forty-Two Generations

> **Matthew 1:17** — "So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations"

**3 × 14 = 42 generations** from Abraham to Christ. The complete timeline through tribulation to the Deliverer.

### 4. Mathematical Significance

**42 = 6 × 7 = Man × Perfection**

Man (6) attempting perfection (7)—but falling short. The beast's counterfeit rule.

**42 = 14 × 3 = Deliverance × Divine**

Ironically, through tribulation (42) comes ultimate deliverance (3 sets of 14).

### 5. Forty-Two Camps in the Wilderness

> **Numbers 33:1-49** — Israel had 42 encampments from Egypt to the Jordan

FORTY-TWO stages of wilderness journey—the complete tribulation before entering rest.

### 6. Forty-Two Youth and Elisha

> **2 Kings 2:24** — "there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare **forty and two** children of them"

Forty-two youth mocked Elisha and faced judgment—rebellion against God's prophet.
