## The Argument

### 1. Seventy Times Seven: Unlimited Forgiveness

> **Matthew 18:21-22** — "Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until **seventy times seven**"

Jesus commanded forgiveness **70 × 7 = 490 times**. This doesn't mean 490 is the limit—it means forgiveness is UNLIMITED, beyond all counting. The number represents the fullness of mercy.

### 2. Daniel's Seventy Weeks

> **Daniel 9:24** — "**Seventy weeks** are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness"

**Seventy weeks = 70 × 7 = 490 years**

This prophecy declares 490 years for:
- Finishing transgression
- Ending sins
- Making reconciliation
- Bringing everlasting righteousness

The complete redemptive timeline = 490.

### 3. Mathematical Significance

**490 = 70 × 7 = 7 × 7 × 10**

- 7 = Spiritual perfection
- 70 = Complete eldership/authority
- 10 = Ordinal completeness
- 490 = Perfection × perfection × completeness

### 4. Answering Lamech's Vengeance

| Lamech | Jesus |
|--------|-------|
| 77-fold vengeance (Gen 4:24) | 490-fold forgiveness (Mt 18:22) |
| Human wrath | Divine mercy |
| Multiplied revenge | Unlimited grace |

Jesus' 70 × 7 directly contrasts with Lamech's 70 + 7. Grace overwhelms vengeance by orders of magnitude.

### 5. The Components of Daniel's 490

> **Daniel 9:25-27** breaks down the 70 weeks:
- 7 weeks (49 years): Rebuilding Jerusalem
- 62 weeks (434 years): Until Messiah
- 1 week (7 years): Covenant confirmed, then broken

**7 + 62 + 1 = 70 weeks = 490 years**

The precise timeline to Messiah's coming and atonement.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **7** | Perfection; 490 = 7 × 70 |
| **70** | Eldership; 490 = 7 × 70 |
| **77** | Vengeance (contrasted); 490 overwhelms 77 |
| **49** | Jubilee; 490 = 49 × 10 (ten Jubilees) |

---

## Ten Jubilees

**490 = 49 × 10** = Ten Jubilee cycles

After 490 years (ten Jubilees), the ULTIMATE Jubilee arrives:
- Ultimate debt cancelled
- Ultimate slaves freed
- Ultimate restoration

Christ's atonement is the Jubilee of Jubilees.

## Summary

**FOUR HUNDRED NINETY** symbolizes **UNLIMITED FORGIVENESS AND COMPLETE REDEMPTION**—the fullness of divine mercy. Jesus commanded 70 × 7 forgiveness, overwhelming Lamech's 77-fold vengeance. Daniel's 70 weeks (490 years) prophesied the complete timeline to atonement. As 7 × 70 (or 49 × 10), it represents perfection multiplied—the final, complete, inexhaustible measure of grace.
