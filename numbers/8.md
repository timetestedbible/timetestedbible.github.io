## The Argument

### 1. Noah's Eight: New Beginning After Judgment

> **1 Peter 3:20** — "wherein few, that is, **eight souls** were saved by water"

> **2 Peter 2:5** — "saved Noah the **eighth** person, a preacher of righteousness"

EIGHT people survived the flood to begin humanity anew. After the complete judgment (40 days), EIGHT started fresh.

### 2. Circumcision on the Eighth Day

> **Genesis 17:12** — "he that is **eight days** old shall be circumcised among you"

> **Leviticus 12:3** — "in the **eighth day** the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised"

Circumcision—the sign of covenant and new identity—occurs on the EIGHTH day, one day beyond the complete week.

### 3. The Eighth Day: First Day of New Week

The eighth day is simultaneously the **first day** of a new week. This is why:

> **Matthew 28:1** — "In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the **first day** of the week"

Jesus rose on the FIRST day (the EIGHTH day from the previous week's start)—resurrection as new beginning.

### 4. Temple Dedication: Eight Days

> **1 Kings 8:66** — "On the **eighth day** he sent the people away"

> **2 Chronicles 7:9** — "in the **eighth day** they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days"

The Temple dedication concluded with an EIGHTH day—new worship beginning.

### 5. Feast of Tabernacles: The Eighth Day

> **Leviticus 23:36** — "on the **eighth day** shall be an holy convocation unto you... it is a solemn assembly"

> **Leviticus 23:39** — "on the **eighth day** shall be a sabbath"

The seventh feast (Tabernacles) has an EIGHTH day—pointing beyond the complete cycle to eternal rest.

### 6. David: The Eighth Son

> **1 Samuel 16:10-11** — David was the eighth son of Jesse

David, the king who pictures Christ, was the EIGHTH son—the new beginning of Israel's monarchy.

## Eight as Seven Plus One

| Seven | Eight |
|-------|-------|
| Completion | New beginning |
| End of cycle | Start of new cycle |
| Sabbath rest | Resurrection day |
| Old creation | New creation |

Eight is not just seven plus one—it is the **transcendence** of the complete cycle, pointing to resurrection and eternal life.
