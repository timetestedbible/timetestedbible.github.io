## The Argument

### 1. The Ten Commandments

> **Exodus 20:1-17** — The Ten Commandments

> **Deuteronomy 4:13** — "he declared unto you his covenant, even **ten commandments**; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone"

TEN commandments define human responsibility before God. This is the foundational expression of ten as the number of law and obligation.

### 2. Ten Plagues on Egypt

> **Exodus 7-12** — The ten plagues:

1. Water to blood
2. Frogs
3. Lice
4. Flies
5. Livestock disease
6. Boils
7. Hail
8. Locusts
9. Darkness
10. Death of firstborn

TEN plagues = complete judgment on Egypt for failing its responsibility.

### 3. Ten Generations: Adam to Noah

> **Genesis 5** — Ten generations from Adam to Noah:

Adam → Seth → Enosh → Kenan → Mahalalel → Jared → Enoch → Methuselah → Lamech → Noah

A complete cycle of TEN generations before the flood judgment.

### 4. The Tithe: A Tenth

> **Genesis 14:20** — Abraham "gave him **tithes** of all"

> **Leviticus 27:32** — "the **tenth** shall be holy unto the LORD"

> **Malachi 3:10** — "Bring ye all the **tithes** into the storehouse"

The TENTH belongs to God—representing our complete obligation/responsibility.

### 5. Ten Days of Testing

> **Daniel 1:12** — "Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, **ten days**"

> **Revelation 2:10** — "ye shall have tribulation **ten days**: be thou faithful unto death"

TEN days as a complete period of testing/proving.

### 6. Ten Virgins

> **Matthew 25:1** — "the kingdom of heaven be likened unto **ten virgins**"

TEN virgins—representing the complete assembly facing accountability.
