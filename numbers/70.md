## The Argument

### 1. Seventy Elders of Israel

> **Exodus 24:1** — "Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and **seventy of the elders** of Israel"

> **Numbers 11:16** — "Gather unto me **seventy men of the elders** of Israel... and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them"

SEVENTY elders shared Moses' burden and spirit—complete governmental authority.

### 2. Seventy Disciples Sent

> **Luke 10:1** — "the Lord appointed other **seventy** also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city"

> **Luke 10:17** — "the **seventy** returned again with joy"

Jesus sent SEVENTY (beyond the twelve)—extending authority to a complete ruling body.

### 3. The Sanhedrin: Seventy Plus One

The Jewish Sanhedrin consisted of 70 elders plus the high priest (71 total)—the complete judicial authority of Israel, modeled on Moses and the seventy.

### 4. Seventy Nations (Genesis 10)

> **Genesis 10** — The Table of Nations lists SEVENTY descendants of Noah

Seventy represents the complete number of nations—all humanity organized under seventy heads.

### 5. Seventy Years of Captivity

> **Jeremiah 25:11-12** — "these nations shall serve the king of Babylon **seventy years**. And it shall come to pass, when **seventy years** are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon"

> **Daniel 9:2** — "I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish **seventy years** in the desolations of Jerusalem"

SEVENTY years of judgment—a complete cycle of discipline.

### 6. Seventy Weeks of Daniel

> **Daniel 9:24** — "**Seventy weeks** are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity"

SEVENTY weeks (490 years) = the complete prophetic timeline for Israel's redemption.

### 7. The Limit of Human Life

> **Psalm 90:10** — "The days of our years are **threescore years and ten** (70)"

SEVENTY years = a complete human lifespan.
