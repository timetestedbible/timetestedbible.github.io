## The Argument

### 1. Eighteen Years of Oppression

> **Judges 3:14** — "So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab **eighteen years**"

> **Judges 10:8** — "that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: **eighteen years**, all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan"

Israel suffered EIGHTEEN years under oppressors—complete periods of bondage.

### 2. The Woman Bound Eighteen Years

> **Luke 13:11, 16** — "behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity **eighteen years**, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself... ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these **eighteen years**, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"

A woman was bound by Satan for EIGHTEEN years—bondage that Jesus broke.

### 3. Mathematical Significance

**18 = 6 × 3 = Man × Divine**
**18 = 9 × 2 = Finality × Witness**

Six (man) multiplied by three (divine) can represent man under divine judgment. Or finality (9) witnessed (2)—confirmed suffering.

### 4. Eighteen and the Tower of Siloam

> **Luke 13:4** — "Or those **eighteen**, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them"

EIGHTEEN died when the tower fell—sudden calamity and death.

### 5. Before Deliverance

EIGHTEEN often precedes liberation:
- After 18 years under Moab → Ehud delivered (Judg 3:15)
- After 18 years of Philistine/Ammonite oppression → Jephthah delivered (Judg 11)
- After 18 years of infirmity → Jesus set free (Lk 13:12)

Eighteen is the darkness before dawn.
