# 666 — Number Study

## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **One Word** | Antichrist |
| **Two Words** | Ultimate Rebellion |
| **Sentence** | The number of the beast and ultimate human rebellion—representing man exalting himself to godhood, the counterfeit trinity, and humanity's final defiance against the Creator |

**Opposite**: 777 (God's perfection) / 888 (Jesus - resurrection life)

## The Argument

### 1. The Number of the Beast

> **Revelation 13:18** — "Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is **the number of a man**; and his number is **Six hundred threescore and six** (666)"

Scripture explicitly identifies 666 as:
- The beast's number
- The number of MAN (not God)
- Requiring wisdom to understand

### 2. Six Tripled: Man Attempting Divinity

**666 = 6 + 6 + 6** or **6 × 111**

- 6 = Man (created on day 6)
- Three sixes = man's attempt to reach divine status
- Trinity counterfeit: Man-Man-Man instead of Father-Son-Spirit

### 3. Falling Short Tripled

- 6 falls short of 7 (perfection)
- 66 falls short of 77
- 666 falls short of 777

Each digit is incomplete. The ultimate expression of human insufficiency.

### 4. Solomon's Gold: A Warning

> **1 Kings 10:14** — "Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was **six hundred threescore and six** talents of gold"

The ONLY other occurrence of 666 in Scripture describes Solomon's annual gold income—at the height of wealth that led to his downfall.

### 5. The Mark Required

> **Revelation 13:17-18** — "that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or **the number of his name**"

666 becomes the required identification for commerce—ultimate allegiance to the beast system.

## Key Occurrences

| Context | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Number of beast (Rev 13:18) | Antichrist's identity |
| Number of man (Rev 13:18) | Human, not divine |
| Solomon's gold (1 Kgs 10:14) | 666 talents—warning |
| Mark for commerce (Rev 13:17) | Required allegiance |

---

## The Counterfeit Trinity

| True Trinity | Counterfeit |
|--------------|-------------|
| Father | Dragon (Satan) |
| Son | Beast (Antichrist) |
| Spirit | False Prophet |
| 777 | 666 |

The dragon, beast, and false prophet form an unholy trinity—666 as their signature.

## Mathematical Properties

| Analysis | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 6 × 111 | 666 |
| 6 + 60 + 600 | 666 |
| Sum of 1-36 | 666 (1+2+3+...+36) |
| 36 = 6 × 6 | Man squared |

666 is the 36th triangular number—36 = 6 × 6, intensifying the man symbolism.

## Gematria Considerations

Various names have been calculated to equal 666:
- Nero Caesar (in Hebrew)
- Various rulers throughout history
- The point: many have embodied the beast spirit

---

## The Warning

| 666 | 888 |
|-----|-----|
| Number of the beast | Gematria of "Jesus" (Greek) |
| Man exalted | God incarnate |
| Counterfeit | Genuine |
| Death | Resurrection |

The choice: align with 666 or 888.

## Connection to Other Numbers

| Number | Relationship |
|--------|--------------|
| **6** | Man; 666 = 6 × 111 |
| **7** | Perfection; 666 < 777 |
| **3** | Counterfeit trinity |
| **888** | Jesus in Greek gematria |

---

## Summary

**SIX HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX** symbolizes **THE BEAST AND ULTIMATE REBELLION**—humanity's final exaltation against God. It is explicitly the "number of a man," representing human effort tripled but still falling short of divine sevens. Solomon's 666 talents of gold foreshadowed the danger. The mark of 666 will be required for commerce in the beast's system. It is the counterfeit trinity—man-man-man instead of Father-Son-Spirit.
