## The Argument

### 1. Jacob's Twenty Years Waiting

> **Genesis 31:38, 41** — "This **twenty years** have I been with thee... Thus have I been **twenty years** in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle"

Jacob waited TWENTY years for redemption from Laban—a period of expectant labor.

### 2. Twenty Years Under Jabin

> **Judges 4:3** — "the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and **twenty years** he mightily oppressed the children of Israel"

Israel waited TWENTY years for deliverance from Jabin—until Deborah and Barak arose.

### 3. The Ark at Kirjath-jearim

> **1 Samuel 7:2** — "the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was **twenty years**: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD"

The ark rested TWENTY years while Israel waited for restoration—a period of longing.

### 4. Age of Service and Accountability

> **Numbers 1:3** — "From **twenty years** old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war"

> **Exodus 30:14** — "Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from **twenty years** old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD"

TWENTY years marked adulthood—readiness for service and accountability.

### 5. The Redemption Price

> **Leviticus 27:5** — "And if it be from five years old even unto **twenty years** old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels"

The valuation for vow redemption between 5-20 years: TWENTY shekels for males—connecting twenty with redemption.

Twenty combines complete order (10) with witness (2), or earthly completeness (4) with grace (5)—waiting expectancy.
