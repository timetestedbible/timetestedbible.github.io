## The Argument

### 1. Abraham at One Hundred: Isaac Born

> **Genesis 21:5** — "And Abraham was **an hundred years** old, when his son Isaac was born unto him"

Abraham was ONE HUNDRED when the promised seed came—complete fulfillment of promise at the age of fullness.

### 2. The Lost Sheep: One Hundred Complete

> **Matthew 18:12-13** — "if a man have **an hundred sheep**, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"

> **Luke 15:4** — "What man of you, having **an hundred sheep**, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness"

ONE HUNDRED represents the complete flock. 99 is incomplete; 100 is wholeness—the shepherd seeks until fullness is restored.

### 3. Hundredfold Fruitfulness

> **Matthew 13:8** — "But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some **an hundredfold**, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold"

> **Mark 4:8** — "some **an hundred**"

> **Mark 10:30** — "he shall receive **an hundredfold** now in this time"

ONE HUNDREDFOLD is maximum fruitfulness—complete return on the seed sown.

### 4. Mathematical Significance

**100 = 10 × 10 = Order × Order**

Ten (complete order) squared = COMPLETE COMPLETENESS. The fullest expression of divine order.

### 5. One Hundred Years of Blessing

> **Isaiah 65:20** — "the child shall die **an hundred years** old"

In the coming kingdom, even the young will live to one hundred—complete blessing.
