## The Argument

### 1. The Ninth Hour: Christ's Death

> **Matthew 27:46** — "And about the **ninth hour** Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"

> **Mark 15:34** — "at the **ninth hour** Jesus cried..."

> **Luke 23:44-46** — "it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the **ninth hour**... Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit"

Jesus died at the NINTH hour (3 PM)—the hour of FINALITY for the atonement.

### 2. Nine = Three Times Three

Nine is 3 × 3—the intensification of divine completeness:
- Three = divine perfection
- Nine = perfection of perfection = FINALITY

### 3. Nine Gifts of the Spirit

> **1 Corinthians 12:8-10** — Nine spiritual gifts:

1. Word of wisdom
2. Word of knowledge
3. Faith
4. Healing
5. Working of miracles
6. Prophecy
7. Discerning of spirits
8. Tongues
9. Interpretation of tongues

NINE gifts representing the Spirit's complete manifestation.

### 4. Nine Fruits of the Spirit

> **Galatians 5:22-23** — "But the fruit of the Spirit is **love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance**"

NINE aspects of the Spirit's fruit—the complete character of spiritual maturity.

### 5. Ninth Hour Prayer

> **Acts 3:1** — "Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the **ninth** hour"

The ninth hour was a designated prayer time—connecting finality with approach to God.

### 6. Nine Beatitudes

> **Matthew 5:3-11** — Nine "Blessed are..." statements

NINE beatitudes describing the complete character of kingdom citizens.
