## Symbolic Meaning

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|

---

## The Argument

### 1. The Holy Trinity

> **Matthew 28:19** — "baptizing them in the name of the **Father**, and of the **Son**, and of the **Holy Ghost**"

> **2 Corinthians 13:14** — "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost"

> **1 John 5:7** — "there are **three** that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these **three** are one"

God exists in THREE persons—the foundational expression of divine completeness.

### 2. Resurrection on the Third Day

| Reference | The Third Day |
|-----------|---------------|
| Jonah 1:17 | Jonah in the fish **three** days and nights |
| Matthew 12:40 | "so shall the Son of man be **three** days and nights in the heart of the earth" |
| Luke 24:7 | "be crucified, and the **third** day rise again" |
| 1 Corinthians 15:4 | "rose again the **third** day according to the scriptures" |

Resurrection—the completion of God's redemptive work—occurs on the THIRD day.

### 3. Three-Fold Patterns in Scripture

| Pattern | Reference |
|---------|-----------|
| Three visitors to Abraham | Genesis 18:2 |
| Three-fold priestly blessing | Numbers 6:24-26 |
| "Holy, holy, holy" | Isaiah 6:3; Revelation 4:8 |
| Faith, hope, love | 1 Corinthians 13:13 |
| Three temptations of Christ | Matthew 4:1-11 |
| Three denials of Peter | Matthew 26:34 |
| Three affirmations from Peter | John 21:15-17 |
| Three woes | Revelation 8:13 |
| Three unclean spirits | Revelation 16:13 |

When something appears in threes, it signals divine completeness or emphasis.

### 4. Three Days as Complete Period

> **Hosea 6:2** — "After **two** days will he revive us: in the **third** day he will raise us up"

> **Luke 13:32** — "I do cures to day and to morrow, and the **third** day I shall be perfected"

The third day marks completion and perfection.

### 5. Three-Part Structure

Many biblical elements have three parts:
- **Tabernacle**: Outer Court, Holy Place, Holy of Holies
- **Temple**: Same three divisions
- **Man**: Body, soul, spirit (1 Thess 5:23)
- **Time**: Past, present, future
- **Ages**: Patriarchal, Mosaic, Christian

## Summary

**THREE** symbolizes **DIVINE COMPLETENESS**—the Trinity, resurrection, and the fullness of God's purposes. When something is repeated three times or occurs on the third day, it signals that God's work is complete and perfect. Three is the number of divine testimony and perfection.
